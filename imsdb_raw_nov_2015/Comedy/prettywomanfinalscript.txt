                          FINAL SCRIPT

                   by Jonathan Frederick Lawton

      From the original script written by J.F. Lawton, with the help of

      Stephen Metcalfe, Barbara Benedek, Robert Garland and probably

      Garry Marshall (the director of the film) himself. This original

      script itself was adapted from Lawton's first script called Three

      Thousand, which was a much darker story about prostitution and

      drugs.

          We hear voices over of people chattering and laughing.

           Broke in right on the two of them. Caught them.

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - PATIO - EXTERIOR DAY

          We are in Philip Stuckey's residence on the Hollywood Hills.

          Apparently, a party is in progress.

          Close Up on the Magician's hands and the hands of two ladies. The

          magician is doing tricks with coins in the ladies' hands.

                          MAGICIAN (voice over)

           So let's imagine, ladies, that you're a Savings and Loan

           officer. Watch. One, two, three. See ?

          On lady has got three coin in her hand, and the other one only

          one. The magician takes the three coins from the first lady's

          hand, and closes it. Then he takes the only coin from the other

          lady's hand, but leaves it open. He puts the four coins in his

          hand and closes it.

          Credits appears in white capital letters on the screen.

                          MAGICIAN (voice over)

           You've got it all, and we've got nothing. And you have all

           four. Just take a look.

          He opens his hand, which is empty. Then he opens the first lady's

          hand, which contains the four coins.

                          WOMAN (voice over)

           Oh !

                          MAGICIAN (voice over)

           But I wouldn't trust you with real gold. That's why this

           one's only worth about a penny.

          He takes one of the coins from the first lady's hand, hides it in

          his hand, and makes it appears again changed into a huge penny

          coin.

          End of the first set of credits.

                          MAN (voice over)

           Hmm.

                          MAGICIAN (voice over)

           And if you wonder where the other one went, watch.

          His left hand moves to the first lady's' ear, and gets the missing

          penny out of it.

                          PHILIP

           A penny from the ear. How much for the rest ?

          Philip Stuckey, the host, walks behind the magician. Philip is a

          short man in his forties, with receding hair. He looks, at the

          same time, obsequious and domineering. His guests laugh at his

          joke. Philip moves toward a young man.

          The camera follows Philip.

                          PHILIP

           Have you seen Edward ?

           THE YOUNG MAN

           No, I haven't. Great party, Philip.

                          PHILIP

           Well, my wife went to a lot of trouble : she called a

           caterer.

          He walks to a group of guest gathered around a large buffet table.

          Behind the table, the balustrade of the patio, and in the

          background, Hollywood Hills.

                          PHILIP

           Excuse me, Ann. Howard, how are you ?

                          HOWARD

           Philip, good. Hey, I understand Edward's taking over Morse

           Industries.

                          PHILIP

           Yeah, well, he's not here to get a suntan.

                          HOWARD

           Can I get in on it ?

                          PHILIP

           Yeah. Call me.

                          HOWARD

           When ?

                          PHILIP

           Just call me.

          He turns to another guest and shake hands with him.

                          PHILIP

           Uh, hi. I'm Philip Stuckey, Edward Lewis's lawyer.

                          THE GUEST

           Hey, where's the guest of honor anyway ?

                          PHILIP

           Well, if I know this fellow, he's probably off in a corner

           somewhere charming a very pretty lady.

          He turns to a charming lady talking with a man.

                          PHILIP

           How are you ?

          He gives her a kiss.

          Very modern design. An artistic picture of a nude girl on the

          wall.

          Medium shot of Edward Lewis standing near the desk, talking on the

          telephone. He is a very handsome man in his early forties. He is

          very elegantly dressed, apparently with a very expensive suit.

                          EDWARD

           I told my secretary to make the arrangements. Didn't she

           call you ?

           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)

           Yes, she did. I speak to your secretary more than I speak

           to you.

                          EDWARD

           I see.

           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)

           I have my own life too, you know, Edward.

                          EDWARD

           This is a very important week for me. I need you here.

          He walks to the large bay window, overlooking Hollywood Hills.

           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)

           But you never give me any notice. You just think I'm at

           your beck and call.

                          EDWARD

           I do not believe that you are at my beck and call.

           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)

           Well, that's the way you always make me feel. Maybe I

           should just move out.

                          EDWARD

           If that's what you want, yes.

           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)

           All right, when you get back to New York, we'll discuss it.

                          EDWARD

           Now is as good a time as any.

           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)

           That's fine with me, Edward. Good-bye.

          She hangs up.

                          EDWARD

           Good-bye, Jessica.

          Edward looks down, through the bay window, to the party still

          going on on the patio on the floor below. We can hear the chatter

          from the party.

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - STAIRWAY - INTERIOR DAY

          Edward is going down the stairs followed by a young blonde man,

          wearing a very elegant suit.

                          YOUNG MAN

           Phil suggested that maybe I should take a lawy...

                          EDWARD

           Phil is just my lawyer, okay ?

                          YOUNG MAN

           Yes, sir.

                          EDWARD

           How did the Morse stock open at the Nikkei ?

                          YOUNG MAN

           I don't know.

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DOWNSTAIRS HALL - INTERIOR DAY

          They have reached the downstairs hall. Edward looks at his watch

          and then turns toward the young man. He is looking slightly angry.

                          EDWARD

           You don't know ? Tokyo opened maybe ninety minutes ago. You

           have to keep on top of these things, all right ?

                          YOUNG MAN

           Done.

          Two charming women walks near the two men. One of the woman turns

          toward Edward.

                          CHARMING WOMAN

           Hello, Mr. Lewis.

                          EDWARD

           Hi. How're you doing ?

          Edward shakes the woman's hand, who walks away, and turns back to

          the young blonde man.

                          EDWARD

           I want this whole thing... wrapped up as soon as possible.

           I gotta get to New York by Sunday. I got tickets to the

           Met.

                          YOUNG MAN

           Yes, sir.

          He moves across the crowd of guests, and reaches a servant, who

          gives him his coat.

                          SERVANT

           Your coat, Mr. Lewis.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you.

          He starts walking away with his coat in his hands, when he turns

          around to the sound of a feminine voice.

                          SUSAN

           Edward !

                          EDWARD

           Susan !

          Susan is a beautiful woman, in her late thirties, wearing an

          elegant yellow silk blouse.

                          SUSAN

           Hi.

                          EDWARD

           Hi.

          They kiss on both cheeks.

                          SUSAN

           I was sorry to hear about Carter.

                          EDWARD

           Oh, yeah. Thanks. Heard you got married.

          They start walking slowly toward the exit of the house, Edward's

          arm around Susan's waist.

                          SUSAN

           Well... yeah. I couldn't wait for you !

          She laughs.

                          EDWARD

           Mmm... Mmm... Susan, tell me something.

                          SUSAN

           Yes ?

          They stop walking, and Edward faces Susan.

                          EDWARD

           When you and I were dating, did you speak to my secretary

           more than you spoke to me ?

                          SUSAN

           She was one of my bridesmaids.

                          EDWARD

           Hmm. Your husband's a very lucky guy.

          They kiss again on the cheeks.

                          EDWARD

           Bye.

                          SUSAN

           Thanks, bye.

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of Philip seated in an armchair, talking to a

          beautiful red-hair woman, seated in another armchair.

                          PHILIP

           Do you ?

           THE RED-HAIR WOMAN

           Absolutely.

                          PHILIP

           Wonderful.

          Elizabeth, Philip's wife, walks rapidly toward Philip's armchair

          and taps him on the shoulder. Elizabeth is a red-hair woman in her

          forties. She is still nice-looking, and very elegantly dressed,

          but she doesn't have anymore the attraction that a younger woman

          can have on Philip.

                          ELIZABETH

           He's leaving. Edward's leaving.

          Philip looks toward the entrance of the house, and stands up.

                          PHILIP

           Excuse me.

           THE RED-HAIR WOMAN

           Sure.

          Philip walks rapidly away while Elizabeth looks at him with both

          hand on her hips.

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - PARKING - EXTERIOR DAY

          Close shot on a beautiful car : a grey Lotus Esprit.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           Is this Mr. Stuckey's car ?

          Medium shot of two Japanese parking valets, wearing white shirts,

          black bow-ties and black vests, looking at him. One of them

          answers him in Japanese. We don't understand what he says, but we

          understand the word Stuckey in his sentence.

          Medium shot on Edward standing near Philip's Lotus. Edward turns

          around just as Philip is rushing toward him.

                          PHILIP

           Edward, where you going ?

                          EDWARD

           You got the keys to your car ?

                          PHILIP

           Why, what's wrong with the limo ?

                          EDWARD

           Look, the limo is buried back there. Darryl can't get it

           out.

          Darryl, Edward's chauffeur, is reading a newspaper, next to

          another chauffeur. Darryl is a very tall and very strong-looking

          Afro-American man. He raises his hand to show his helplessness

          about the situation.

                          PHILIP

           Mmm.

                          EDWARD

           Please give me the keys.

          Philip gives his car keys to Edward.

                          PHILIP

           All right, look. I don't think you should drive. You're a

           little excited. Don't drive my car. Let me work something

           out here.

          Philip runs toward the Japanese valets.

                          PHILIP

           Fellas, what kind of a system is this ? Can you move these

           cars out of here ?

          Meanwhile, Edward has seated himself in the driver seat of the

          Lotus Esprit. Philip comes back to him as Edward closes the door

          of the car.

                          PHILIP

           Look, Edward. Edward... Uh, are you familiar with a stick

           shift ?

                          EDWARD

           Uh, yeah.

                          PHILIP

           Have you driven a shift ?

                          EDWARD

           Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

                          PHILIP

           Listen, all right. Just be ginger with it. Don't...

          We hear the gears of the manual box clashing under Edward's

          unexperienced hand.

                          PHILIP

           It's a new car. Don't, uh... Just don't...

                          EDWARD

           Okay. I can do it.

          Tires squeal as the car rushes forward.

          The Japanese valets look up at the noise.

          Edward has stopped after a couple of feet, and Philip runs to the

          driver's door.

                          PHILIP

           Edward ! Give me a break, please !

                          EDWARD

           I love this car.

                          PHILIP

           I love it too. Look, you don't even know where you're

           going. You're gonna get lost in the dark !

          The car rushes forward. Tires squeal as Edward accelerate down the

          hill road.

          The sky is slightly darker. Night is falling.

                          PHILIP (YELLING)

           Beverly Hills is down the hill !

          Full shot of the Lotus Esprit driving along the streets of

          Hollywood Hills. Edward has switched the lights on.

          We hear the song King of Wistful thinking, performed by Go West.

                          LYRICS

           I don't need to fall at your feet. Just 'cause you cut me

           to the bone. And I won't miss the way that you kiss me.

          The sky is getting darker, and apparently, Edward doesn't know his

          way very well around Hollywood Hills.

          Long shot on the famous HOLLYWOOD sign up on Hollywood Hills

          Back to the car driving on the roads of Hollywood Hills.

           We were never carved in stone. If I don't listen to the

           talk of the town. Then maybe I can fool myself. I'll get

           over you I know I will. I'll pretend my ship's not sinking.

           And I'll tell myself I'm over you.

          The overview now shows Hollywood Boulevard.

          Medium shot of two prostitutes cruising on the sidewalk. A car

          drives along the sidewalk, but doesn't stop.

           MAN IN CAR (voice over)

           What do you say, blondie ?

           ONE OF THE PROSTITUTE

           Hi, honey, want some fun ?

          Close Up on the Carole Lombard Star on the Hollywood Boulevard

          sidewalk.

          Medium shot on two other prostitutes cruising on the sidewalk.

           ONE OF THE PROSTITUTE

           Hey, baby, you looking for a date ?

          Larger shot on a car stopping near the prostitute

           MAN IN CAR

           Yeah, honey, we're looking.

                          PROSTITUTE

           Well, here I am.

           MAN IN CAR

           I'm Al and this is my friend Joe. Get in the car.

          Another very short view of Hollywood Boulevard, showing a Close

          shot on a Chinese Restaurant. An then, a very fast horizontal

          panning of the camera, which gives us a blurred picture. The

          panning stops in :

          SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium long shot on a very quiet side street near Hollywood

          Boulevard. The street seems even much quieter after all the noise

          and the hustle we've seen on the Boulevard itself.

          The credits are still appearing and disappearing on the screen.

          An ambulance is driving very fast along the street, with its siren

          wailing. On the side of the ambulance is written : Los Angeles

          Fire Department, and below : Paramedic.

          The camera lets the ambulance go and moves to show us a shady-

          looking building with a vertical neon sign saying HOTEL, but

          only the H and the O are lit, the others letters being out of

          order.

          The music fades out.

          This building actually is partly a regular hotel, and partly a

          place that rents small apartments on a monthly basis.

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          We are in the small apartment rented by Vivian Ward and Kit De

          Luca, two young prostitutes, whom we are going to know better

          later on.

          Close Up on a pretty woman buttocks, just covered by a very small

          black lace panty.

          An alarm clock is ringing.

          The woman turns around, and shows us her stomach and her navel,

          showing from under a pink T-shirt.

          The camera pans up to the woman's arm and hand stopping the alarm-

          clock.

          Close-Up on several familial pictures pinned on the wall.

          Close-Up on the woman putting on a white sleeveless close-fitting

          T-shirt over her black lace bra. But we don't see the woman's

          head.

          Close-Up on the woman's hand picking up cheap jewels from a table,

          and putting them on. On the table there is also an empty bottle of

          a strong alcoholic beverage.

          a black felt-pen to hide the clear spots on the heel of the boot.

          of the boot.

                          LYRICS

           Gonna break it loose. Gonna keep on moving wild.

          Close-Up on the face of the woman, putting mascara on her

          eyelashes. The woman is named Vivian Ward, and her head is covered

          by a blonde wig.

                          LYRICS

           Gonna keep on swinging, baby I'm a real wild child.

          HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          The Lotus is driving through a crossroad. The tires screech, and

          the car swings a little. Apparently, Edward is still having

          problems with his gear shift.

          The camera follows the car for a couple of seconds.

          VIVIAN'S HOTEL STAIRCASE - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Close Up on Vivian's legs going down the stairway. Then the camera

          moves backward and we see her in full. Another woman is going up

          the stairs.

           HOTEL MANAGER (voice over)

           Now, wait a minute. You don't seem to understand me.

          Vivian stop in mid-stairs.

           HOTEL MANAGER (voice over)

           That's my job. At the end of the month, I collect

           everybody's rent.

          Quick shot, through the bannister, of the manager talking to an

          Afro-American woman.

          Back to Vivian still standing on the stairs.

           HOTEL MANAGER (voice over)

           Now give me the money, or you're outta here.

          Vivian goes back up the stairs.

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Close-Up on the toilet water tank, and Vivian's hands taking the

          lid off. She then takes a green plastic box out of the water. She

          opens the box and looks at the money hidden inside the box. There

          is only one one-dollar bill left.

                          LYRICS

           That I'm a wild one. Ooh, yeah I'm a wild one.

          Vivian opens a window and gets out of the room.

          VIVIAN'S HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          High angle shot of Vivian going out of the window and on the

          emergency exit.

           Gonna break the news. Gonna keep on moving wild. Gonna keep

           on swinging, baby. I'm a real wild child.

          Vivian starts going down the emergency stairway.

          SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          A dark street around Hollywood. The Lotus is driving slowly. The

          engine is revving, as the car turns around the corner of the

          street.

          LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Edward looks around him, visibly a bit anxious : he know he is

          completely lost.

          VIVIAN'S HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Close Up on Vivian's face seen through the emergency ladder moving

          down.

          An old woman is looking at her from across the street.

          Full shot on the building and Vivian going down the steps of the

          emergency ladder.

          Close shot on Vivian reaching ground level and walking away.

           crazy everything seems hazy.

          Medium shot. Vivian walks though a gap in the wire fence behind

          the hotel, and walks away on the street. The camera tilts slightly

          up and we see a painted inscription on the wall of the hotel that

          says HOTEL - APTS.

                          LYRICS

           I'm a wild one. Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one. Gonna break the

           Gonna keep on swinging, baby I'm a real wild child.

          End of credits.

          The camera pans around and comes down to street level.

          The music fades out.

          We hear the voice of an Afro-American man yelling.

           THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over)

           Welcome to Hollywood ! Everybody comes to Hollywood got a

           dream. What's your dream ? What's your dream ?

          A young man with a red T-shirt and a white cap crosses the

          boulevard on a skateboard. He reaches the sidewalk and gets lost

          in the crowd. We see the Afro-American man. He is wearing a flashy

          printed shirt. He crosses the boulevard coming toward us.

                          THE AFRO-AMERICAN

           Hey, mister ? Hey, what's your dream ?

          Medium shot on a group of three young men seated on the sidewalk.

          One of them is the skateboard man we've just seen crossing the

          boulevard.

          The young man stands up. He has apparently given something

          (drugs ?) to the two other ones.

                          SKATEBOARD MAN

           Have a good one.

          He jumps on his skateboard and rolls away. He passes Vivian who is

          walking toward us.

          With the street lights, we get a better view of Vivian. She is a

          young woman in her early twenties. She is very tall and slim. She

          is a beautiful woman, even though her prostitute outfit and heavy

          make-up makes her a little less beautiful than she actually is.

          She is wearing a red jacket and a man's very large cap on her

          blonde wig. Underneath the jacket she is wearing her very short

          sleeveless white top, which is attached to her also very short

          blue skirt with a big metal ring. She is carrying a big bag

          strapped on her shoulder.

           A WOMAN (voice over)

           What happened ?

           A MAN (voice over)

           Some chick. She bought it over there.

          Medium shot just a little further on the street. A young plain-

          cloth policeman is showing his badge to an afro-american man.

                          THE POLICEMAN

           Detective Albertson. What do you know about that girl ?

                          THE AFRO-AMERICAN

           I tell you, man. I don't know who she hang with.

          Vivian walks behind them. She gives them a quick look, but doesn't

          stop.

                          THE POLICEMAN

           Come on, guy. We just pulled her out of a Dumpster in the

           back. Who was her pimp ?

          The camera follows Vivian, but we keep hearing what the two men

          are saying.

           THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over)

           Cocaine her pimp. She a strawberry. She be out on these

           streets day in, day out, trading her sorry self for some

           crack.

          Vivian stops, and looks at something we don't see on the sidewalk.

          She turns her head away, not feeling well because of what she has

          just seen.

           THE POLICEMAN (voice over)

           And what do you do ?

          Back to the two men.

                          THE AFRO-AMERICAN

           I'm cool.

           THE POLICEMAN (snickering)

           Oh, I'll bet.

          He turns around. Two tourists, a male and a female are taking

          snapshots of what is down on the pavement, and which we still

          haven't seen.

                          THE POLICEMAN

           Hey, hey, hey ! Excuse me ! Excuse me ! What are you, from

           the press ?

           THE FEMALE TOURIST

           No, no. We're from Orlando.

          The policeman looks at his uniformed colleague.

                          THE POLICEMAN

           Oh, I don't believe this. Do you... I got tourists

           photographing the body, Al.

          The uniformed policeman starts pulling the tourists away.

          Close-Up shot on a lit sign that says The Blue Banana Club,

          Full shot from across the street, showing the entrance of the

          club, with the sign, that we've just seen, above the door.

           WOMAN (voice over)

           What happened ?

           ANOTHER WOMAN (voice over)

           Man !

          THE BLUE BANANA CLUB - MAIN ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Close up on a woman's hips moving in rhythm with the sound of the

          music. The camera tilts up and we discover she is painting a

          fresco on the wall of the club. The fresco represents various

          hippy-looking characters.

          The camera pans along the fresco and then moves back into the

          crowd of the club. People are dancing. We hear the song Show Me

          Your Soul performed by Red Hot Chili Peppers.

                          LYRICS

           In a world that can be so insane. I don't think it's very

           strange for me to be in love with you.

          Vivian crosses the dance floor and stops near a staircase leading

          to the upper floor. She looks around, visibly looking for someone.

                          LYRICS

           I wanna know more than your brain.

          Vivian walks to the bar. The bartender is an older man, nicknamed

          Pops.

                          VIVIAN

           Hey, Pops, has Kit been in here ?

                          POPS

           Upstairs in the poolroom.

          Vivian goes to the staircase and start walking upstairs.

                          LYRICS

           Not something that I respected. And now I smile for your

           affection. We have made a soul connection.

          THE BLUE BANANA CLUB - UPSTAIRS POOLROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Close shot on Kit De Luca sitting down, and bobbing her head up

          and down in rhythm with the music.

          Kit is a girl in her early twenties. She is clearly shorter than

          Vivian, and has dark hair. She looks a bit Latino. Actually she

          from Italian origin. She is pretty, but not as beautiful as

          Vivian, and more vulgar. She is wearing sunglasses and is absently

          combing the front of her hairline.

                          LYRICS

           Just for whom does your bell toll. Don't be cruel. Show me

           your soul.

          Kit suddenly realizes that someone is standing near her and

          looking down at her. She stops combing her hair and looks up. She

          takes her glasses off and smiles.

                          KIT

           Yo, Viv !

          Vivian doesn't smile back at her, and looks even a bit angry.

                          VIVIAN

           Is it all gone ?

          Instead of answering her friend's question, she points to the

          people around her.

                          KIT

           Carlos, you know my roommate, Vivian. This is Angel. That's

           the Dude.

                          VIVIAN

           I know everybody ! Is it all gone, Kit ?

                          KIT

           Carlos sold me some great shit. We just had this party. I

           was the hostess.

                          VIVIAN

           I can't believe you bought drugs with our rent. What is

           going on with you, Kit ?

          Vivian grabs Kit's arm and makes her stand up.

                          KIT

           I needed a little pick-me-up.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, we need rent money !

          Carlos stands up and faces Vivian. He is a young Latino man.

                          CARLOS

           Yo, calm down, chica. She only owes me 200 more.

                          KIT

           Carlos !

                          VIVIAN

           Another 200 dollars ?

                          KIT

           That was from way before.

                          CARLOS

           That's right, 200, Vivian. But if you wanna work off her

           money with me, we can work something out.

                          KIT

           That's a very sweet offer, Carlos, but not now.

          She grabs Vivian's arm and leads her to the staircase.

                          KIT

           Come on, Viv. Come downstairs.

                          VIVIAN

           Work out... Work out what ? What are we gonna work out ?

          When they are gone, the girl named Angel looks at Carlos.

                          ANGEL

           You really like her, Carlos ?

          The music fades out.

          THE BLUE BANANA CLUB - MAIN ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Vivian and Kit are walking down the staircase.

                          VIVIAN

           You took it while I was sleeping ?

                          KIT

           You were unavailable for consultation.

          Kit walks to the bar, and makes Vivian follow her.

                          KIT

           Hey, let's go. Snack ! Snack !

          She has reached the bar and starts picking bits of food in plates

          on the counter.

                          KIT

           Besides, it's my apartment.

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah, well, I have to live there too, Kit.

                          KIT

           Look, you came here. I gave you some money. I gave you a

           place to stay...

          Close Up on Kit's hands picking food (olives, onions, cherries...)

          in the snack plates, and putting them on a paper napkin.

                          KIT

           ...and some valuable vocational advice. He was on my case.

           I had to give him something.

          Back to the two girls behind the bar.

                          KIT

           So don't irritate me.

                          POPS

           This ain't a buffet, Kit.

          Kit moves around Vivian, sits on a stool at the bar, and starts

          eating.

                          VIVIAN

           Irritate you ? Irritate you ? I just saw a girl pulled out

           of a Dumpster.

          She sits down on another stool.

                          KIT

           I know. Skinny Marie. But... she was a... a flake. She was

           a crack head. Dominic was trying to straighten her out for

           months.

          We hear people shouting in the background and glass being broken.

          The two girls turns their heads around for a second and then come

          back to their conversation at the bar.

           WOMAN (voice over)

           Leave her alone !

           Leave her alone !

           WOMAN (voice over)

           Come on, Blake !

                          VIVIAN

           Don't you want to get out of here ?

                          KIT

           Get out of where ? Where the fuck you wanna go ?

          SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          A very quiet street.

          Close shot on a tramp looking though some junks left over on the

          sidewalk, in front of a house.

                          THE TRAMP

           Aah, nothing but garbage.

          Full shot on the street, seen from the other side of the street.

          The Lotus Esprit stops at the tramp's level.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           Uh, excuse me.

          The tramp lifts his head.

                          THE TRAMP

           Huh ?

           EDWARD (voice over)

           Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills ?

                          THE TRAMP

           You're here !

          Close Up shot on Edward's face behind the wheel on his car.

           THE TRAMP (voice over)

           That's Sylvester Stallone's house right there.

          He snickers.

          Back to the full shot of the street with the Lotus and the tramp

          behind it.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           Thank you.

                          THE TRAMP

           You're welcome.

          The car moves away.

          HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium full shot on Vivian and Kit standing near a table on which

          a man is selling some souvenirs. Another prostitute is leaning on

          a tree. Kit walks toward the prostitute.

                          KIT

           Hey, yo, Rachel.

                          RACHEL

           What ?

                          KIT

           Yeah. You see the stars on the sidewalk, babe ?

          She is mentioning the stars of the Walk of Fame, embedded in the

          sidewalk of the boulevard.

                          RACHEL

           Yeah.

                          KIT

           Well, Vivian and me, we work Bob Hope, we work the Ritz

           Brothers, we work Fred Astaire, we work all the way down to

           Ella Fitzgerald. This is our turf. We got seniority. You

           better get off our corner.

                          RACHEL

           Forgive me. I was just taking a rest here. Besides, she's

           new.

                          KIT

           Yeah. Well, I'm old, so go rest up by Monty Hall or Esther

           Wilson.

                          RACHEL

           Williams.

                          KIT

           Esther Williams ! Where you belong !

                          RACHEL

           Back off, Kit. You know, you're really becoming a grouch.

          She walks away on the boulevard. Kit turns toward Vivian.

                          KIT

           Am I really a grouch ?

                          VIVIAN

           Yes. Sometimes.

                          KIT

           Well, just 'cause I'm hungry. I'm gonna go get something to

           eat.

          We hear someone whistling, and then :

           MAN (voice over)

           Hey, girls.

          Kit turns toward the boulevard, where the voice is coming from.

                          KIT

           Hey, yo, baby !

          Medium shot on an open convertible red car driving along the

          boulevard. In the car, three young men, two in the front, one in

          the back. The man sitting next to the driver, yells to the girls.

           MAN IN THE CAR

           How about a freebie ? It's my birthday.

          The car keeps on moving on the boulevard and out of view.

          Back on Vivian and Kit.

                          KIT

           Dream on !

                          VIVIAN

           It's looking really slow tonight.

          She takes her cap off.

                          KIT

           Yeah, well... maybe we should get a pimp, you know. Carlos

           really digs you.

                          VIVIAN

           And then he'll run our lives and take our money. No.

                          KIT

           You're right. We say who, we say when, we say how much.

                          VIVIAN

           Do you think I look like Carol Channing ?

          Kit puts her hands on Vivian's blonde wig.

                          KIT

           No ! I love this look. It's very glamorous. Glamour choice.

          We hear brakes screeching. Kit turns around toward the noise.

                          KIT

           Oh, yo, oh, yo. Catch this !

          Full shot on the boulevard. The Lotus is driving along the

          boulevard. The car bounces a little, while the gears are grinding.

          Back to the two girls watching the car. Vivian points to it.

                          VIVIAN

           Wait a minute. That's a Lotus Esprit.

          We see the car passing in front of the girls. Apparently, it has

          stopped a little further on the boulevard, because we hear its

          brakes screeching.

          Reverse angle shot showing the two girls with the stopped car

          behind them.

                          KIT

           No, that's rent. You should go for him. You look hot

           tonight. Don't take less than a hundred. Call me when

           you're through. Take care of you.

          Vivian hugs Kit.

                          VIVIAN

           Take care of you.

          She takes her jacket off and puts it across her bag. She walks

          slowly toward the car.

           KIT (voice over)

           Work it. Work it, baby. Work it ! Work it. Own it.

          LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Edward is sitting behind the wheel.

                          EDWARD

           Yes, you can handle this.

          Close Up on Edward's hand trying to work the gearshift.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           First is here somewhere.

          We hear the gears grinding, but the shift doesn't want to move

          into first gear position.

          Back to Edward sitting in his car. We see Vivian's back bending to

          look through the passenger's window.

                          VIVIAN

           Hey, sugar, you looking for a date ?

                          EDWARD

           No, I wanna find Beverly Hills. Can you give me

           directions ?

          Reverse angle shot showing Vivian's face through the window

                          VIVIAN

           Sure. For five bucks.

          Reverse angle shot on Vivian's back.

                          EDWARD

           Ridiculous.

                          VIVIAN

           Price just went up to ten.

                          EDWARD

           You can't charge me for directions.

          Reverse angle shot on Vivian's face.

                          VIVIAN

           I can do anything I want to, baby. I ain't lost.

          Reverse angle shot on Vivian's back. She is standing up.

          Reverse angle shot showing Vivian's standing body through the

          window.

                          EDWARD

           All right, okay ?

          HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Full shot. On the other side of the boulevard, a little group of

          people, including Carlos, is looking at the scene.

                          CARLOS

           Is that Vivian ?

                          ANOTHER MAN

           Where ?

          Medium shot on the Lotus seen from the back. Vivian opens the

          passenger door and climbs in.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           All right. You win, I lose. Got change for a twenty ?

          LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Vivian grabs the 20 dollars bill, and puts it away.

                          VIVIAN

           For twenty, I'll show you personal. Even show you where the

           stars live.

                          EDWARD

           Oh, that's all right. I already been to Stallone's.

          HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          On the other side of the boulevard, the little group is still

          looking at the scene. They start crossing the boulevard.

          LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT

                          VIVIAN

           Right. Uh, down the street.

          HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          The little group is still crossing the boulevard.

                          CARLOS

           Vivian, did you forget ? I told you don't take no dates

           tonight.

          LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Edward tries to start the car, but he just starts the windshield

          wipers !

           CARLOS (voice over)

           Vivian !

                          VIVIAN

           Let's go.

          Close up on Edward's hand trying to work the gearshift.

           CARLOS (voice over)

           Hey, where you going, baby ?

          HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Close Up on the Lotus rear license plate : 2QCE465

           CARLOS (voice over)

           Vivian !

          Larger shot on the car driving away.

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           Lights ! Lights would be good here.

          Full shot on Hollywood Boulevard traffic, with the Lotus, seen

          from the front in the middle of the traffic.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           I guess this is not the greatest time to be a hooker, is

           it ?

          Closer shot showing the couple seen through the windshield

                          VIVIAN

           Look, I use condoms always. I get checked out once a month

           at the free clinic. Not only am I better in the sack than

           an amateur, I am probably safer.

          LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT

                          EDWARD

           I like that. That's very good. Should have that printed on

           your business card.

                          VIVIAN

           If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.

                          EDWARD

           No, I'm not making fun of you.

          HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          The couple seen through the windshield.

                          EDWARD

           No, I'm not making... I'm not. I wouldn't offend you. I'm

           sorry.

          Back on the boulevard. A traffic light going from amber to red. We

          hear the tires screeching as the car stops.

          LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT

                          EDWARD

           What's your name ?

                          VIVIAN

           What do you want it to be ?

          Edward smiles to her.

                          VIVIAN

           Vivian. My name is Vivian.

                          EDWARD

           Vivian.

          HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          The light turned green, and the car starts.

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           So, what hotel you staying at ?

           EDWARD (voice over)

           The, uh, Regent Beverly Wilshire.

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           Down the block, right at the corner.

          We hear gears grinding.

          HOLLYWOOD - A WIDE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          We are now off Hollywood Boulevard, in another wide street or

          boulevard in Hollywood.

          Full shot on the car moving away from us.

          Medium shot of the couple through the windshield.

                          VIVIAN

           Man, this baby must corner like it's on rails !

                          EDWARD

           I beg your pardon ?

                          VIVIAN

           Well, doesn't it blow your mind ? This is only four

           cylinders.

          LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Close Up on Edward's hand trying to change gears. It doesn't

          really succeed, and we hear a grinding noise.

          HOLLYWOOD - A WIDE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Back on the shot through the windshield.

                          EDWARD

           You know about cars. Where did that come from ?

                          VIVIAN

           Road and Track. The boys back home I grew up with, they

           were really into American heavy metal : Mustangs,

           Corvettes.

                          EDWARD

           Ah.

          LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT

                          VIVIAN

           They bought them cheap and fixed them up. I paid attention.

           So how is it you know so little about cars ?

                          EDWARD

           My first car was a limousine.

                          VIVIAN

           Oh.

                          EDWARD

           So where is this...

          He tries to shift gears and gets another grinding noise.

                          EDWARD

           ...heavy metal... home ?

                          VIVIAN

           Milledgeville, Georgia. You know, I think you left your

           transmission back there. You're not shifting right. This is

           a standard H.

                          EDWARD

           Standard H. Like I know what that means.

          She laughs.

                          EDWARD

           Have you ever driven a Lotus ?

                          VIVIAN

           No.

                          EDWARD

           You're gonna start right now.

          HOLLYWOOD - A WIDE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Back on the shot through the windshield.

                          VIVIAN

           You're joking.

                          EDWARD

           No. It's the only way I can get you off my coat.

          Medium shot on a lingerie shop.

          We see Vivian's head, and then the camera follows her as she

          climbs into the driver's seat. Edward closes his door on the

          passenger's side. Vivian closes her door and puts her seat belt

          on.

                          VIVIAN

           Fasten your seat belts. I am taking you for the ride of

           your life. I'm gonna show you what this car can really do.

           Are you ready ?

                          EDWARD

           I am ready.

                          VIVIAN

           Hang on.

                          EDWARD

           Okay.

                          VIVIAN

           Here we go.

          She adjusts the back-view mirror.

          Medium close-up shot of the car seen from the back with the camera

          set on the road. The car starts very fast, but also very

          smoothly : it is now driven by very expert hands.

          Several shots of the car racing along the streets.

          Shot of the the couple through the windshield.

                          VIVIAN

           This has pedals like a race car. They're really close

           together. So it's probably easier for a woman to drive,

           because they have little feet. Except me. I wear a size

           nine.

          LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT

                          VIVIAN

           You know your foot's as big as your arm from your elbow to

           your wrist ?

          She shows her arm to Edward, who chuckles.

                          VIVIAN

           Did you know that ?

                          EDWARD

           No, I didn't know that.

                          VIVIAN

           It's a little bit of trivia.

          Edward looks at her and smiles.

          Shot of the couple seen through the windshield.

                          EDWARD

           Tell me, what kind of... what kind of money you girls make

           these days ? Ballpark.

                          VIVIAN

           Can't take less than a hundred dollars.

                          EDWARD

           A hundred dollars a night ?

                          VIVIAN

           For an hour.

                          EDWARD

           An hour ? You make a hundred dollars an hour and you got a

           safety pin holding your boot up ? You gotta be joking.

          LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT

                          VIVIAN

           I never joke about money.

                          EDWARD

           Neither do I. Hundred dollars an hour. Pretty stiff.

          She puts her right hand on Edward's zipper.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, no. But it's got potential.

          Edward doesn't react, but he looks at her in such a way that she

          feels she has better take her hand off his zipper.

          BERVERLY HILLS - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Several shots of the car driving fast in Beverly Hills.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          The tires of the car squeal as it makes a last fast turn to stop

          in front of the hotel.

          Full shot. The Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel is a very luxurious

          hotel, certainly one of the most expensive hotel of the Los

          Angeles area.

          Medium shot on a uniformed attendant, who is standing near the

          entrance of the hotel, and rushes to Edward's car.

          Medium full shot on the Lotus parked in front of the hotel. The

          attendant opens the passenger's door of the car, while Vivian

          comes out of the car on her own.

                          HOTEL ATTENDANT

           Good evening, Mr. Lewis. Will you be needing the car

           anymore tonight ?

                          EDWARD (LAUGHING)

           I... I hope not !

          He gets out of the car. The attendant closes the door and then

          moves away, while Vivian joins Edward on the sidewalk.

                          VIVIAN

           Ah. You're here.

                          EDWARD

           Yeah.

          He looks at her for a couple of second, before talking again.

                          EDWARD

           So you'll be all right ?

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab with my twenty bucks.

                          EDWARD

           Go back to your office.

          She laughs.

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah. My office. Yeah.

                          EDWARD

           Well, thanks for the ride.

                          VIVIAN

           See you.

                          EDWARD

           Good-bye.

          Edward starts turning around to go inside the hotel, but doesn't

          do it, and instead looks back in Vivian's direction.

          Medium shot on Vivian seated on the backrest of a public bench,

          with her feet resting on the bench itself. She puts her cap back

          on.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           No taxis ?

                          VIVIAN

           No, I like the bus.

          Edward walks to the bench on which Vivian is sitting.

          Quick medium shot on the uniformed attendant watching the scene

          with curiosity from the entrance of the hotel.

          Back to Vivian and Edward.

                          EDWARD

           I was thinking... Did you really say a hundred dollars an

           hour ?

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah.

                          EDWARD

           Yeah... Well, if you don't have any prior engagements, I'd

           be very pleased if you would accompany me into the hotel.

                          VIVIAN

           You got it.

          She gets off the bench and laughs.

                          VIVIAN

           What is your name ?

          They start walking toward the entrance of the hotel

                          EDWARD

           Edward.

                          VIVIAN

           Edward. That's my favorite name in the whole world !

          He smiles.

                          EDWARD

           No ?!

                          VIVIAN

           I tell you what, this is fate, Edward. That's what this is.

                          EDWARD

           Why don't you put this on ?

          He puts his coat, which he was carrying on his arm, on Vivian's

          shoulders, and then wraps it around Vivian's body, in order to

          cover as much as he can of Vivian's very conspicuous outfit.

                          VIVIAN

           Why ?

                          EDWARD

           Well, this hotel is not the kind of establishment that

           rents rooms by the hour.

                          VIVIAN

           Ah.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium shot on Edward and Vivian crossing the hotel lobby. While

          walking, Vivian puts her arms into the sleeves of the coat. Then

          she raises her eyes to look at the luxury around her.

                          VIVIAN

           Wow !

           EDWARD (voice over)

           It's all right.

          Medium full shot on the guests seated in comfortable armchairs

          near the front desk. All these guests are very elegantly dressed,

          and mostly middle-aged. They all look with curiosity at the

          strange couple that just walked in.

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           Holy shit.

                          EDWARD

           You're gonna be fine. Come with me. And stop fidgeting.

          Another medium shots on seated guests staring at the couple.

          Edward walks to the reception desk, with Vivian following him. A

          very neatly dressed female receptionist is behind the counter.

                          FEMALE RECEPTIONIST

           Good evening, Mr. Lewis.

                          EDWARD

           Hello. You have messages ?

                          FEMALE RECEPTIONIST

           Yes, we have several.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you.

          While Edward is looking through his messages, Vivian is leaning on

          the wall near the reception desk and looks around her. She takes

          her cap off, but one still can see her strange outfit underneath

          the slightly open coat. She stares at a passing female guest who

          stares back at her.

                          EDWARD

           Could you send up some champagne and strawberries, please ?

                          FEMALE RECEPTIONIST

           Of course.

          She picks up the phone.

                          FEMALE RECEPTIONIST

           Room service for Mr. Lewis, please.

          Edward slowly walks away from the desk, taking Vivian along with

          him.

          Medium shot on the elevator doors. Edward and Vivian reach the

          elevator, and Edward presses the call button. A middle-aged couple

          is already waiting for it. They both look at Vivian. Vivian turns

          around and notice their disapproving look. She raises her leg and

          puts the tip of her boot on the high ash-tray set near the door of

          the elevator, showing her thigh to the couple, and especially to

          the man.

                          VIVIAN

           Oh, honey. You know what's happened ? I've got a runner in

           my pantyhose.

          She laughs and turns to the middle-aged couple.

                          VIVIAN

           I'm not wearing pantyhose.

          We hear the ding of the elevator bell. Vivian puts her leg down.

          The elevator door opens on Dennis, the young elevator attendant.

          Vivian is the first one to walk in.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, color me happy ! There's a sofa in here for two.

          Edward wants to let the middle-aged couple enter the elevator

          first. The man starts to move, but his wife holds him back.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Reverse angle shot on Vivian sitting on the sofa at the back of

          the cabin. She puts one leg on the sofa. Dennis looks at her and

          smiles.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Back on the entrance of the elevator. Edward starts to walk in the

          cabin. The middle-aged couple remains outside.

                          EDWARD

           First time in an elevator.

           THE FEMALE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE

           Ah...

          She turns her head toward her husband.

           THE FEMALE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE

           Close your mouth, dear.

          The door of the elevator closes.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Dennis doesn't look at the couple behind him, but he still has a

          very broad smile. Vivian stands up from the sofa.

                          VIVIAN

           Sorry, I couldn't help it.

                          EDWARD

           Try.

          The elevator moves up. Dennis tries to look casual, but doesn't

          really succeed.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - PENTHOUSE HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Close shot on the elevator door. It opens.

                          DENNIS

           Penthouse.

                          VIVIAN

           The penthouse. Mmmm !

                          EDWARD

           Yes.

          Vivian gets out of the elevator.

                          EDWARD

           To the left.

                          VIVIAN

           Oh.

          Edward gets out of the elevator. Dennis can't keep his eyes off

          Vivian, and watches her walking in the hallway. Edward turns

          around and looks at him a bit severely. Dennis wipes the smile off

          his face, goes back into the cabin of the elevator and closes the

          doors. The camera follows Edward walking away to the door of the

          penthouse, where Vivian is waiting for him. He gets his magnetic

          card out of his pocket.

          Close Up on Edward's hands trying to insert the magnetic card into

          the slot in the lock of the door. He sighs.

                          EDWARD

           Oh, I miss keys.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium shot on the penthouse living room with the front door in

          the background. Everything - the rug on the floor, the furniture -

          is nice and very classy. All the lights are on. The front door

          opens.

          Edward walk in first, followed by Vivian. He switches more lights

          on. Vivian closes the door and starts walking around the huge

          living room. Edward looks at her.

                          EDWARD

           Impressed ?

                          VIVIAN

           You kidding me ? I come here all the time. As a matter of

           fact, they do rent this room by the hour.

                          EDWARD

           Sure they do.

          Edward has been taking a newspaper left by an attendant on a small

          table near the front door. He crosses the room and and drops the

          newspaper on the desk. He sits down behind the desk, and starts

          looking through his mail, while Vivian walks out on the terrace.

           VIVIAN (voice over from the terrace)

           Wow, great view ! I bet you can see all the way to the

           ocean from out here.

                          EDWARD

           I'll take your word for it, because I don't go out there.

          Vivian walks in the room through another French window-door on the

          other side of the desk. She puts her bag on an armchair.

                          VIVIAN

           Why don't you go out there ?

                          EDWARD

           I'm afraid of heights.

                          VIVIAN

           You are ?

          Edward nods his head.

                          VIVIAN

           So how come you rented the penthouse ?

                          EDWARD

           It's the best. I looked all around for penthouses on the

           first floor, but I can't find one.

          Vivian takes off Edward's coat and puts in on a sofa.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, now that you have me here, what are you going to do

           with me ?

                          EDWARD

           Want to know something ? I don't have a clue.

                          VIVIAN

           No ?

                          EDWARD

           I hadn't exactly planned this.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, do you plan everything ?

          She takes her red jacket off.

                          EDWARD

           Always.

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah. Me too.

          She sits down on an armchair.

                          VIVIAN

           I'm actually... No, I'm not a planner. I wouldn't say I was

           a planner. I would say I was, hum, a kind of fly by the

           seat of my pants girl. You know, moment to moment. That's

           me. That's... Yeah.

          Edward, still seated behind his desk, watches her with a strange

          look in his eyes. He suddenly realizes that perhaps he hasn't done

          something very wise in bringing Vivian with him.

                          VIVIAN

           Mm-hmm. You know, you could pay me. That's one way to maybe

           break the ice.

                          EDWARD

           Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.

          He takes his wallet out of this jacket.

                          VIVIAN

           Cash works for me, yeah.

          She stands up and walks to the desk. Edward puts the money on the

          desk. She takes the money and sits on the desk. She puts the money

          in one of her high boots.

                          EDWARD

           You're on my fax.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, that's one I haven't been on before.

          She doesn't stand up but moves slightly in a very suggestive way.

          Edward takes his fax, but doesn't seem to react at Vivian's

          suggestive movements.

                          EDWARD

           Cute. Very cute. Thank you.

          She laughs, and zips one of her boots down. Out of the boot, she

          takes several condoms wrapped in cellophane paper.

                          VIVIAN

           All right. Here we go. Pick one. I got red, I got green, I

           got yellow. I'm out of purple, but I do have one gold

           circle coin left. The condom of champions. The one and

           only. Nothing is getting through this sucker. What d'you

           say ? Hmm ?

                          EDWARD

           A buffet of safety.

                          VIVIAN

           I'm a safety girl.

          Edward stands up from his desk. Immediately Vivian reaches for his

          zipper.

                          VIVIAN

           All right, let's get one of these on you.

                          EDWARD

           No, no. I...

          He laughs awkwardly.

                          EDWARD

           Why don't we just talk for a little bit, okay ?

          He takes his jacket off, and puts it on the back of the desk

          chair.

                          VIVIAN

           Talk. Yeah... uh... okay. Edward, are you in town on, uh,

           business or pleasure ?

                          EDWARD

           Business, I think.

          He walks away from the desk across the room.

                          VIVIAN

           Business, you think.

          She zips her boot back up, stands up and follows him across the

          room.

                          VIVIAN

           Well... let me guess.

          Edward, now in his shirtsleeves, but still with his necktie and

          his vest on, has seated himself in an armchair.

                          VIVIAN

           That would make you... a lawyer.

          She sits downs on a low pouf in front of his armchair.

                          EDWARD

           A lawyer ?

                          VIVIAN

           Mm-hmm.

                          EDWARD

           What makes you think I'm a lawyer ?

                          VIVIAN

           You've got that, um... sharp, useless look about you.

                          EDWARD

           I bet you've known a lot of lawyers.

                          VIVIAN

           I've known a lot of everybody.

          The doorbell chimes. They both stand up.

                          VIVIAN

           What is that ?

          He turns around and find his face very close to Vivian's face, and

          seems a little disturbed by it.

                          EDWARD

           Champagne.

                          VIVIAN

           Oh ! Well. Might as well make myself useful. Take a load

           off.

          The doorbell chimes again.

          Vivian runs across the room to the front door and opens it. A room

          service male attendant comes in carrying a loaded tray. Vivian

          closes the door behind him.

           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT

           Good evening.

                          VIVIAN

           Hi.

           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT

           Uh, where would you like it ?

                          VIVIAN

           Where would we like it ?

          Edward has seated himself back in the armchair.

                          EDWARD

           Uh, over by the bar.

          The attendant seems a little surprised by Vivian's outfit, but,

          being a good luxury hotel attendant, he pretends not to notice,

          and carries the tray onto the bar. After he has put the tray down,

          he turns around and almost bumps into Vivian, who was standing

          behind him.

                          VIVIAN

           Excuse me !

          She giggles.

           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT

           It'll be on your bill, Mr. Lewis.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you.

          The attendant doesn't move away and remains close to Vivian,

          staring at her.

                          VIVIAN

           What are you looking at ?

          The attendant clears his throat.

                          VIVIAN

           What is he looking at ?

          Edward walks toward the attendant, and gives him some tip money.

                          EDWARD

           Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much.

           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT

           Thank you very much, sir. Have a nice night.

          The attendant walks out of the room. Edward walks to the bar.

                          VIVIAN

           A tip. Wow. I missed that one. Oh.

           (in a much softer voice)

           Stupid.

                          EDWARD

           Don't worry about it.

          Edward sets the champagne glasses on the bar.

                          VIVIAN

           You mind if I take my boots off ?

          She sits down on the steps that run across the room, separating it

          in two slightly different levels.

                          EDWARD

           Not at all.

                          VIVIAN

           So, do you have a wife ? Girlfriend ?

          She zips one of her boots down.

                          EDWARD

           I have both.

                          VIVIAN

           Where are they ? Shopping together ?

          She takes her knee-length sock off. We hear the champagne bottle

          cork popping off.

                          EDWARD

           My ex-wife... is now in Long Island... in my ex-home...

           with my ex-dog.

          He brings her a glass of Champagne, which he sets down on the

          floor besides her. Vivian is taking her other boot off.

                          EDWARD

           There you go.

          He walks back to the bar to take his own glass.

                          EDWARD

           My ex-girlfriend, Jessica, is in New York... moving out of

           my apartment even as we speak.

          He looks at her, a bit surprised.

          Vivian is draining her glass empty. Edward comes near her, with a

          silver bowl in his hands. In the bowl are some fresh strawberries.

                          EDWARD

           Why don't you try a strawberry ?

          He takes the lid off the bowl and shows it to her.

                          VIVIAN

           Why ?

                          EDWARD

           It brings out the flavor in the champagne.

                          VIVIAN

           Oh, groovy.

          She takes a strawberry and eats it. Edward closes the bowl and

          brings it back on the bar. He sits down on a stool.

                          VIVIAN

           Pretty good. Don't you drink ?

                          EDWARD

           No.

                          VIVIAN

           Listen, I... I appreciate this whole seduction scene you've

           got going, but let me give you a tip : I'm a sure thing,

           okay ? So, I'm on an hourly rate. Could we just move it

           along ?

                          EDWARD

           Somehow I'm sensing that this time problem is a major issue

           with you.

          He stands up.

                          EDWARD

           Why don't we just get through that right now ?

                          VIVIAN

           Great, let's get started.

                          EDWARD

           How much for the entire night ?

                          VIVIAN

           Stay here ?

                          (SHE SNICKERS)

           You couldn't afford it.

                          EDWARD

           Try me.

                          VIVIAN

           Three hundred dollars.

                          EDWARD

           Done. Thank you. Now we can relax.

          He takes the glass off her hand. She stands up.

                          VIVIAN

           Are you sure you want me to stay for the entire night ? I

           mean, I could just pop you good and be on my way.

          She walks to the bar, where Edward is filling the glass with

          Champagne.

                          EDWARD

           To tell you the truth, I don't feel like being alone

           tonight.

          He gives her the glass, and she immediately drinks it. He sits

          down on the stool.

                          VIVIAN

           Why ? Is it your birthday or something ?

                          EDWARD

           No.

                          VIVIAN

           I mean, I have been the party at a couple of birthdays.

                          EDWARD

           I bet you have.

                          VIVIAN

           So what do you want me to do ?

          He doesn't answer immediately, remains pensive for a couple of

          seconds, and then looks at her. He laughs.

                          EDWARD

           I don't know. I really don't know.

          PENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Close Up on the sink, and Vivian's hands been washed. She turns

          the faucet off and takes an white towel to dry her hands.

          The camera tilts up to Vivian's face, who walks to the door.

                          VIVIAN

           I'll be out in just a minute. That champagne kind of got to

           me.

          She closes the door, and goes back to the sink. Edward re-opens

          the door and enters the bathroom.

                          EDWARD

           I didn't hear you. What did you say ?

          Vivian hides something behind her back, but her hand in her back

          can be seen in one of the bathroom mirror.

                          VIVIAN

           Uh... I said I'd be out in just a minute.

          Edward looks worried. He points to her

                          EDWARD

           What is... What do you have in, uh, your hand there ? What

           are you hiding ?

                          VIVIAN

           Nothing.

          He walks toward her and sighs. He grabs her by the arm and moves

          her toward the door. He takes her hand bag

                          EDWARD

           All right, look. I do not want any drugs here. I don't want

           any of this. Get your things and your money and please

           leave.

          She gets rid of his hand.

                          VIVIAN

           I don't do drugs, all right ? I... I stopped doing drugs

           when I was fourteen.

                          EDWARD

           What is this ? What is this ?

          Close Up on Vivian's hand, which Edward is opening by force. She

          was hiding a little box of dental floss. Edward has put Vivian's

          bag under his arm.

                          EDWARD

           This is dental floss.

          She takes her dental floss back.

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah ? So ? I had all those strawberry seeds. And you

           shouldn't neglect your gums.

                          EDWARD

           I'm sorry. Please continue.

                          VIVIAN

           Thank you.

          She walks to the sink. He start walking across the room, but stops

          in his tracks, and looks at her. She turns around from the sink

          and looks at him.

                          VIVIAN

           Are you gonna watch ?

                          EDWARD

           No, I'm going.

          He gives the handbag back to her.

                          VIVIAN

           Thank you.

                          EDWARD

           It's just that, uh, very few people surprise me.

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah, well, you're lucky. Most of them shock the hell out

           of me.

          He nods his head. She goes back to the sink and brings a piece of

          dental floss to her mouth, stops, and brings it down. She turns

          around.

                          VIVIAN

           You're watching.

                          EDWARD

           I'm going.

          He closes the door. Vivian starts cleaning her teeth with dental

          floss.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Close Up shot on the TV screen, where an old black and white

          episode of I love Lucy is being played. It is episode 23 from

          Season 5, called Lucy's Italian Movie. Lucy is standing close to

          a huge bucket full of grapes, and seems a bit reluctant to climb

          into it. Behind her, a fat Italian lady is speaking Italian to

          her.

          We hear recorded laughs coming from the TV set.

          The camera moves away from the TV set.

          We hear Edward's voice speaking on the telephone.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           Yes, that may be true, Vance.

          We hear Vivian laughing.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           Yes, I know, but I still need the numbers on Morse

           Industries.

          On the TV screen, the Italian fat lady is climbing into the bucket

          full of grapes.

          The camera keeps on moving away from the TV set, and we discover

          Vivian sitting on the floor and drinking Champagne. And, behind

          her, we see Edward sitting on an armchair near a small table on

          which the telephone set is resting. Edward is writing on a

          document resting on his laps.

                          EDWARD

           Uh-huh. I've got them from London. I need them now from

           Tokyo. I'll call down and get them when I want them. Thank

           you very much.

          He puts the phone down back on its hook.

          Medium high angle shot on Vivian sitting on the floor, with all

          kinds of goodies around her, including the Champagne bottle in its

          bucket.

                          VIVIAN

           I have a little carpet picnic here. Are you sure you don't

           want a drink ?

          Back on Edward, still writing on the document on his laps. He

          snorts.

                          EDWARD

           I'm high on life. Can't you tell ?

          Quick shot on Vivian laughing.

          Medium shot on the TV screen, where Lucy is putting a reluctant

          foot in the bucket. Close Up on her foot reaching into the grapes.

          She screams with a wide open mouth.

          Back on Vivian changing position and lying on her stomach to be

          more comfortable to watch TV. She laughs.

          Edward watches her without moving from his armchair.

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           You know, I never saw this episode.

          Edward chuckles. And then he stands up.

          Vivian is still lying on the floor, laughing. Edward sits down on

          the sofa next to her.

          Shot on the TV screen, where Lucy is stomping the grapes, with a

          disgusted face. We hear Vivian laughing very loudly.

          Close Up on Vivian's face laughing and holding the glass of

          Champagne. She looks up at Edward, still seated on the sofa.

          Close shot on Edward looking at Vivian

          Close Up shot on Vivian's face. She has a strange smile on her

          face.

          Close Up shot on Edward's face looking at Vivian.

          Back to Vivian. We hear the recorded laughs coming from the TV

          set. Vivian stands up on her arms and knees and walks on all four

          toward the sofa.

          Quick shot on the TV screen, where Lucy and the other woman are

          stomping the grapes.

          High angle shot on Vivian on her knees near the sofa. She puts a

          hand up inside Edward's pants leg. Edward snorts.

          On the TV screen, Lucy now seems to be enjoying her grapes

          stomping.

          Still resting on her knees, Vivian is taking her white top off her

          shoulders. She slips it down, and because the top is attached to

          the skirt, the skirt comes down with it. Vivian is now wearing

          only her black lace underwear and bra. Vivian puts the top and the

          skirt away from her on the floor, and bends down on the seated

          Edward. Suddenly, she stands up and walks away. Edward seems

          surprised. But she comes back with a cushion that she drops on the

          floor, and then kneels on it. She takes the TV remote control from

          the table by the sofa, and presses a button on it.

          On the TV screen, Lucy and the Italian lady are still stomping the

          grapes, but the sound shuts off.

          Back to the sofa. Closer shot. Vivian puts the remote control back

          on the table. Then she leans on Edward, and starts taking his

          necktie off. Edward puts his hand on her hair, and seems

          surprised : he hadn't realized it was a wig.

          Quick shot on the TV screen, where Lucy and her Italian friend are

          now dancing on the grapes.

          Back to the sofa, where Vivian is taking Edward's pants off. She

          opens his shirt on his chest, and bends on it.

          Close Up on their two faces, very close to each other.

                          VIVIAN

           What do you want ?

                          EDWARD

           What do you do ?

                          VIVIAN

           Everything. But I don't kiss on the mouth.

                          EDWARD

           Neither do I.

          She bends on his chest and starts kissing him on the chest, going

          down. She stops to look at the TV.

          On the TV screen, the Italian lady is throwing grapes in Lucy's

          face.

          Back to Vivian, who smiles and resumes her kissing job on Edward's

          chest.

          Close Up shot on Edward's face : he is inhaling very strongly.

          PENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Edward is in the shower, hot water pouring on his head. He opens

          his eyes and seems to think about what just happened. He turns

          around to turn the water off.

          Close Up shot on the shower head. The water stops pouring from the

          head.

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Edward is just out of the bathroom, wearing a white bathrobe. He

          puts his towel around his neck. He bends on the armchair, and

          picks up one of Vivian's bracelet. The camera pans away from the

          armchair, showing Vivian's clothes and stuff scattered around,

          including her blonde wig.

          Edward looks at Vivian's things, then turns his head around toward

          the bed. He looks at the bed for a couple of seconds without

          moving, then starts walking toward the bed.

          Reverse angle shot, showing Vivian asleep on her stomach in the

          bed, her long red hair scattered around her head.

          Edward walks away from the bed.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium full shot in the dark room. Edward is sitting behind the

          desk, working, the only light in the room being the lamp on the

          desk.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY

          Early morning.

          Full shot on the facade of the hotel. Two men are cleaning the

          sidewalk in front of the hotel, one with a water hose, the other

          one with a big broom. A uniformed attendant is watching them,

          standing near the main door of the hotel. The man holding the

          broom walks toward the attendant.

           THE MAN WITH THE BROOM

           Hey, how you doing there ?

           THE UNIFORMED ATTENDANT

           All right.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium full shot of the lobby.

          At his early hour, there are not many guests in the lobby of the

          hotel, only a chambermaid dusting a table, and three uniformed

          attendants talking together.

          Barnard Thompson, the manager of the hotel, crosses the lobby,

          wearing a very elegant dark suit, and carrying a black briefcase.

          Barnard Thompson will be later in the film nicknames Barney by

          Vivian. It is this nickname that we shall use to refer to him in

          the dialogues.

                          BARNEY

           Good morning, gentlemen.

           ONE OF THE UNIFORMED ATTENDANT

           Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

                          BARNEY

           Good morning, good morning.

          He keeps on walking toward the reception desk.

                          ANOTHER ATTENDANT

           Good morning, sir.

          Behind the desk, three clerks, two females and one male

           ONE OF THE FEMALE CLERKS

           Good morning.

           THE OTHER FEMALE CLERK

           Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

          A chambermaid is cleaning some leather armchairs around a low

          table in front of the desk. Without interrupting his walk, Barney

          turns his head toward her.

                          BARNEY

           Good morning, Marjorie.

          She waves her hand to him.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          A uniformed waiter, with white glove, is setting the breakfast

          table. Edward enters the room, wearing a dark-colored night-robe,

          and with a wireless telephone receiver stuck between his head and

          his shoulder.

                          EDWARD

           Of course Morse is going to fight. It's to be expected.

           He's run his company for a very long time now. I don't

           think he's ready to have his name taken off the stationery.

          Edward signs the bill the waiter has shown to him.

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of Philip sitting behind the breakfast table. He is

          talking to Edward on the telephone. On the table in front of him,

          a cup, white china pots and a glass of orange juice.

                          PHILIP

           He wants to meet you face to face, hmm...

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

           EDWARD (whispering to the waiter)

           Okay.

           PHILIP (voice over from the telephone)

           I wouldn't do it.

                          EDWARD

           Sure, you wouldn't. But do it anyhow. Tonight. Dinner. Set

           it up.

          Edward sits on a chair at the breakfast table.

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          PHILIP

           Oh, Edward, Edward. I... Look, it's really not a good idea

           that you see him.

          A middle-aged maid walks behind him with a glass jar of coffee,

          fresh from the percolator. She wants to pour some coffee in

          Philip's cup, but, with his free hand, he moves her away.

                          PHILIP

           Definitely not alone.

                          (HE CHUCKLES)

           You know ? He's a feisty old guy. You know, we say the

           wrong thing...

           (He snaps his fingers)

           ...we could wind up in court.

          The maid walks out of the room.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          EDWARD

           Well, you know, there's always a possibility things are

           gonna go wrong.

          The waiter leaves the room, and Vivian walks in from the bedroom,

          wearing a white bathrobe.

                          EDWARD

           That's why I enjoy this so much. Oh, by the way, Phil,

           about your car.

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Suddenly, Philip has a worried look on his face.

                          PHILIP

           Oh, God. What ?

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Vivian stops in the middle of the room, behind Edward's back.

                          EDWARD

           It corners like it's on rails.

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          PHILIP

           What ? What does that mean ?

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

           PHILIP (voice over on the telephone)

           Edward ? Edward !

          He presses the off button on the telephone and puts it on the

          table. He picks up his newspaper. Vivian has not moved from the

          spot where she had stopped in the middle of the living room.

                          VIVIAN

           Hi.

          Edward turns around and smiles to Vivian.

                          EDWARD

           Well, good morning.

          She slightly touches her hair.

                          VIVIAN

           Red.

                          EDWARD

           Better.

                          VIVIAN

           Y...You didn't wake me. I can see you're really busy. I'm

           gonna be out of here in just a minute.

                          EDWARD

           No, there's no hurry. Are you hungry ? You must be.

          He stands up from the table.

                          EDWARD

           Why don't you sit and have something to eat ?

          She walks slowly to the table.

                          EDWARD

           I, uh, took the liberty of ordering everything on the menu.

          Close Up shot on the table. Edward takes off the metal lids that

          were covering two plates. One has scrambled eggs and bacon, the

          other one has pancakes and strawberries.

                          EDWARD

           I didn't know what you'd like.

                          VIVIAN

           Thanks.

                          EDWARD

           All right ? Good.

          Edward puts the lids on the table. Vivian takes a pancake and

          walks slowly to the terrace. She seems embarrassed.

                          EDWARD

           Did you sleep well ?

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah, too good.

          Vivian enters the terrace.

           VIVIAN (voice over from the terrace)

           I forgot where I was.

          Edward has seated himself at the breakfast table and is working on

          some documents.

                          EDWARD

           Occupational hazard ?

          She comes back into the room and chuckles.

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah. Did you sleep ?

                          EDWARD

           Uh, yes, a little, on the couch.

          She sits down on the table near Edward.

                          EDWARD

           I was, uh, working last night.

                          VIVIAN

           You don't sleep, you don't do drugs, you don't drink, you

           hardly eat. What do you do, Edward ? Because I know you're

           not a lawyer.

          He laughs.

                          EDWARD

           That's right.

          He looks at her sitting on the table, and points to the chairs

          around the table.

                          EDWARD

           There are four other chairs here.

                          VIVIAN

           Oh.

          She stands up and walks to an empty chair. She sits on it with one

          foot on the chair and her knee up above table level. She goes on

          eating breakfast.

                          VIVIAN

           So what do you do ?

                          EDWARD

           I buy companies.

                          VIVIAN

           What kind of companies ?

                          EDWARD

           Uh, I buy companies that are in financial difficulty.

                          VIVIAN

           If they have problems, you must get them for a bargain,

           huh ?

                          EDWARD

           Well, the company I'm buying this week, I'm getting for the

           bargain price of about one billion.

          She almost chokes on her pancake.

                          VIVIAN

           A billion dollars ?

                          EDWARD

           Yes.

                          VIVIAN

           Wow. You must be really smart, huh ?

          He chuckles.

                          VIVIAN

           I only got through the eleventh grade. How far did you go

           in school ?

                          EDWARD

           I went all the way.

                          VIVIAN

           Your folks must be really proud, huh ?

          He doesn't answer and just smiles.

          She keeps on eating and tries to peak at the documents in front of

          him.

          PENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Edward is in shirtsleeves and vest, in front of the mirror,

          knotting his tie. Vivian walks in.

                          VIVIAN

           So you don't actually have a billion dollars, huh ?

                          EDWARD

           No, I get some of it from banks, investors. It's not an

           easy thing to do.

          She sits down on the table in front of him.

                          VIVIAN

           And you don't make anything.

                          EDWARD

           No.

                          VIVIAN

           And you don't build anything.

                          EDWARD

           No.

                          VIVIAN

           So what do you do with the companies once you buy them ?

                          EDWARD

           I sell them.

                          VIVIAN

           Here, let me do that.

          She grabs his necktie and starts knotting it properly.

                          VIVIAN

           You sell them ?

                          EDWARD

           Well, I... don't sell the whole company. I break it up into

           pieces... and then I sell that off. It's worth more than

           the whole.

          Close Up shot on Edward's necktie, and Vivian's hands knotting it.

          Back on a medium shot of Vivian working on Edward's tie.

                          VIVIAN

           So it's sort of like, um, stealing cars and selling them

           for the parts, right ?

                          EDWARD

           Yeah, sort of. But legal.

                          EDWARD

           Mm-hmm.

          Close Up on Edward's tie, which is now very well knotted.

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           There. See, now it's perfect.

          Edward puts a final hand on his tie.

                          EDWARD

           Not bad. Not bad at all. Where'd you learn to do that ?

          She stands up and goes out of the room.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, I screwed the debate team in high school.

          She comes back with his jacket, and helps him put in on.

                          VIVIAN

           I had a grandpa ! He was nice to me. He liked ties on

           Sundays. Mind if I, um, take a swim in your tub before I

           go ?

                          EDWARD

           Not at all. Just stay in the shallow end.

          He goes out of the bathroom, followed, a couple of seconds later,

          by Vivian.

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          The breakfast has been cleared away. Philip's expensive leather

          attache-case is lying on the table, supporting a big agenda.

          Philip is on the phone.

           EDWARD (voice over on the phone)

           Hello ?

                          PHILIP

           Edward, it's Phil. Listen, I'm running out the door.

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot. Edward is speaking on a regular cord phone.

           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

           I just wanted to let you know, Morse is all set for

           tonight.

                          EDWARD

           Oh, that's good.

           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

           He's bringing his grandson.

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          PHILIP

           He's grooming him to take over. I don't know.

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          EDWARD

           Ah, yes. Very intense young man named David. He plays polo.

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          PHILIP

           Look, I gotta say this again. I don't like you going alone,

           you know.

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          In the background, we hear Vivian singing Kiss by Prince... not

          very well !

           VIVIAN (singing in voice over)

           I just want your extra time and your...

          The rest of the song is covered by what Philip is saying to Edward

          over the phone.

           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

           Look... Well, I just think it'd be better if you... if you

           went with a date.

           VIVIAN (singing in voice over)

           Uh-oh !

          Edward walks out of the bedroom, carrying the telephone set.

           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

           You know ? Keep it social.

          He chuckles in the phone.

           VIVIAN (singing in voice over)

           Uh - uh - uh !

          PENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Still carrying the phone set and with the phone receiver on his

          ear, Edward enters the bathroom.

           VIVIAN (singing in voice over)

           Got to know talk, baby, baby !

           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

           Edward ? Did you hear me ?

                          EDWARD

           Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm here.

          He walks to the bathtub, where Vivian is immersed in a foam-bath.

          She has earphones on her ears, and she is singing with her eyes

          closed.

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)

           If you want to impress me...

           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

           What is that ?

          Edward is standing near the bathtub, but Vivian, because of the

          loud music in her earphones and her closed eyes, doesn't seem to

          notice him.

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)

           Oh-oh-oh...

                          EDWARD

           Housekeeping is singing.

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)

           Got to be too flirty, Mama...

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Philip seems a bit surprised by what he hears over the telephone.

           VIVIAN (singing in voice over in the phone)

           I know how to undress me...

          Philip tries to concentrate on what he is saying to Edward.

                          PHILIP

           Yeah... listen.

          PENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Edward is still standing near the bathtub with the telephone to

          his ear.

           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

           Edward, I know a lot of nice girls.

          Edward snorts.

                          EDWARD

           No, you don't.

          Medium shot on the bathtub, where Vivian is still singing with her

          eyes closed. We see the yellow walkman lying on the bathtub edge

          near her head. She is holding the water faucet with one hand.

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)

           I just want your extra time and your...

          She makes loud kisses with her mouth.

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)

           Kiss...

          Back to Edward standing near the bathtub.

                          EDWARD

           Besides, I already have one.

           VIVIAN (singing in voice over)

           If you want to impress me...

          Edward starts walking around the bathtub to get closer to Vivian's

          head.

                          EDWARD

           You just concentrate on finding out what Morse is up to.

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)

           Uh-uh, you can't be too flirty, mama.

                          EDWARD

           I'm on my way.

          High angle close-up shot on Vivian's head.

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)

           I know how to undress me Mm-hmm...

          Slight low angle shot of Edward. He has put the telephone set down

          somewhere, and he is looking at Vivian, smiling.

           VIVIAN (singing in voice over)

           Yeah, baby...

          He sits down on the bathtub edge.

           VIVIAN (singing in voice over)

           I want to be your fantasy. Well, maybe you could be mine.

          Back to Vivian singing in the bathtub.

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)

           Mm-hmm You just leave it. All up to me.

          She opens her eyes and notices Edward sitting on the edge of the

          bathtub close to her. She laughs.

          Edward also laughs looking at her.

          Vivian takes off her earphones, and puts them on the edge with the

          Walkman.

                          VIVIAN

           Don't you just love Prince ?

                          EDWARD

           More than life itself.

                          VIVIAN

           Don't you knock ?

                          EDWARD

           Vivian, I have a business proposition for you.

                          VIVIAN

           What do you want ?

                          EDWARD

           I'm gonna be in town until Sunday. I'd like you to spend

           the week with me.

          Vivian smiles, not believing what she just heard.

                          VIVIAN

           Really ?

                          EDWARD

           Yes. Yes, I'd like to hire you as an employee. Would you

           consider spending the week with me ?

          She laughs awkwardly.

                          EDWARD

           I will pay you to be at my beck and call.

                          VIVIAN

           Look, I'd love to be your beck and call girl, but, uh,

           you're a rich, good-looking guy. You could get a million

           girls free.

                          EDWARD

           I want a professional. I don't need any romantic hassles

           this week.

                          VIVIAN

           If you're talking twenty-four hours a day, it's gonna cost

           you.

                          EDWARD

           Oh, yes, of course !

          He stands up.

                          EDWARD

           All right, here we go. Give me a ballpark figure. How

           much ?

                          VIVIAN

           Six full nights, days too. Four thousand.

                          EDWARD

           Six nights at three hundred is eighteen hundred.

                          VIVIAN

           You want days too.

                          EDWARD

           Two thousand.

                          VIVIAN

           Three thousand.

                          EDWARD

           Done.

                          VIVIAN

           Holy shit !

          She laughs, and dives her head underwater.

          Medium full shot of Edward bending over the bathtub.

                          EDWARD

           Vivian ?

          He talks louder for her to be able to hear him underwater.

                          EDWARD

           Vivian, is that a yes ?

          She taps her feet on the bottom of the bathtub.

          Closer shot of Vivian coming out of the water, her face all

          covered with foam.

                          VIVIAN

           Yes.

          She brushes the foam off her face. Edward dries her face with a

          white towel. She spits water and laughs.

                          VIVIAN

           Yes !

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Edward is coming out of the bedroom, followed by Vivian. Vivian is

          wearing a white bathrobe, and her head is wrapped in a white

          towel.

          Edward has taken his wallet out of his pocket and he is giving

          several banknotes to Vivian.

                          EDWARD

           I'll be gone most of the day. I want you to buy some

           clothes.

          Vivian looks at the thick wad of banknotes he just gave her.

                          VIVIAN

           You really should think about traveler's checks.

          Edward keeps on walking across the room, with Vivian following

          him.

                          EDWARD

           We may be going out evenings. You'll need something to

           wear.

                          VIVIAN

           Like what ?

                          EDWARD

           Uh, nothing too flashy. Not too sexy.

          He stops at the breakfast table, put some documents back in his

          brief-case and closes it.

                          EDWARD

           Conservative. You understand ?

                          VIVIAN

           Boring.

                          EDWARD

           Elegant. Any questions ?

          He picks up his brief-case and walks to the front door.

                          VIVIAN

           Can I call you Eddie ?

                          EDWARD

           Not if you expect me to answer.

                          VIVIAN

           I would've stayed for two thousands.

          He had almost reached the door, but he comes back to face her.

                          EDWARD

           I would've paid four. I'll see you tonight.

          He walks to the front door.

                          VIVIAN

           Baby, I'm gonna treat you so nice, you're never gonna wanna

           let me go.

          He has opened the door but he turns around.

                          EDWARD

           Three thousand for six days. And, Vivian, I will let you

           go.

          He goes out and closes the door. Vivian smiles and speaks very

          quietly.

                          VIVIAN

           But I'm here now.

          She laughs and runs toward the bedroom.

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          She laughs and screams, and jumps on the bed. Still laughing

          wildly, she rolls on the bed.

                          VIVIAN

           Three thousand dollars !

          She kicks the bed with her foot. Then she remains quiet for a

          couple of seconds, gets rid of the towel on her head, and sits up

          on the bed.

                          VIVIAN

           Oof !

          She picks up the telephone set on the night table and puts it on

          the bed.

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - KIT'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Kit is asleep with a scarf spread on her head. She is wearing a

          blue T-shirt. On the night table, various fast food items. The

          phone rings. Kit starts up, and gets rid of the scarf. She pushes

          the covers away, and, in the bed with her, we discover a Teddy

          Bear with a red sweater. She picks up the phone from the floor.

                          KIT

           Hello ?

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Vivian is still seated on the bed, with the phone receiver on her

          ear.

                          VIVIAN

           I called and called. Where were you last night ?

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - KIT'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Kit sits up on her bed, suddenly worried.

                          KIT

           Ma ?

           VIVIAN (voice over on the phone)

           It's Viv.

          Kit relaxes.

                          KIT

           Oh. Hi. I had to party. Where are you ?

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          VIVIAN

           Oh, man. Are you ready for this ? The guy ? The Lotus ? I

           am in his hotel room in Beverly Hills. The penthouse. His

           bathroom is bigger than the Blue Banana !

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - KIT'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Kit has taken a big paper cup, with a straw stuck in it, from the

          night-table.

                          KIT

           Do I have to hear this ?

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Vivian is getting very serious.

                          VIVIAN

           Kit, he wants me to stay the whole week. And you know what

           he's gonna give me ?

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - KIT'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

           VIVIAN (voice over on the phone)

           Guess. You'll never guess.

          Kit drinks some soda from her cup.

           VIVIAN (voice over on the phone)

           Three thousand dollars.

                          KIT

           Bullshit !

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          VIVIAN

           I swear to God. And extra money to buy clothes.

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - KIT'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Kit is walking around the room with the telephone receiver stuck

          between her head and her shoulder.

                          KIT

           Oh, man ! I am bummed. I gave that guy to you !

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

          Kit enters the kitchen and puts her soda cup on the table. The

          room is a mess. Dirty dishes in the sink. Table covered with food

          and junk. Clothes hanging to dry in the shower cubicle.

                          KIT

           Three thousand. Really ? Is he twisted ?

          Kit looks for something in the mess in the sink.

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Vivian is now lying on her back with her legs on the pillow.

                          VIVIAN

           No.

           KIT (voice over on the phone)

           Ugly ?

                          VIVIAN

           He's good-looking !

           KIT (voice over on the phone)

           Well, what's wrong with him ?

                          VIVIAN

           Nothing.

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

          Kit comes out of the shower cubicle with a toothbrush in her hand.

                          KIT

           Did he give you the money yet ?

           VIVIAN (voice over on the phone)

           At the end of the week.

                          KIT

           That's what's wrong with him.

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Vivian turns around on the bed.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, he gave me three hundred for last night. And, Kit ?

          She sits on the bed.

                          VIVIAN

           I'm gonna leave some at the front desk for you. I want you

           to pick it up.

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Kit is brushing her teeth while speaking on the phone.

           VIVIAN (voice over on the phone)

           I'm at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Write it down. Are you

           writing it down ? You'll forget it. Write it down.

          Kit sits down, picks up a felt pen and write on the plastic stool

          she is sitting on.

                          KIT

           Reg... Bev... Wil.

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          VIVIAN

           Now, one more thing. Where do I go for the clothes ? Good

           stuff, on him.

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          She is still seated on the stool.

                          KIT

           In Beverly Hills ?

           VIVIAN (voice over on the phone)

           Yeah.

                          KIT

           Rodeo Drive, baby.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot. Near the reception desk, the hotel manager, Barnard

          Barney Thompson is talking with an Italian male guest and an

          older lady seated in a wheelchair. The Italian guest is showing a

          business card to Barney and talking in Italian.

          Vivian crosses the lobby, dressed in the same prostitute outfit as

          the day before, but without her wig. She has her large handbag

          across her shoulder and her red jacket is tied around her waist.

          Barney gives her a quick look, but goes back to his conversation

          with the Italian guest. He takes the card the Italian is holding.

                          BARNEY

           Ah !

          Medium shot on the reception desk. Miss Wilson, a blonde

          bespectacled receptionist girl is behind the desk.

                          VIVIAN

           Hi.

                          MISS WILSON

           Yes, ma'am. May I help you ?

          Vivian puts an envelope on the desk.

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah, I'm leaving this here for Kit De Luca. She's gonna

           pick it up.

          The receptionist takes the envelope and looks at it.

                          VIVIAN

           Don't open that.

                          MISS WILSON

           No, ma'am.

          Back on Barney and the Italian guests.

                          [ SPEAKING ITALIAN ]

           THE ITALIAN GUEST

           Multo Grazie. Arrivederci.

                          BARNEY

           Arrivederci.

          Vivian walks near them, with the high heels of her boots clicking

          on the floor. The Italian starts pushing the wheelchair. Barney

          looks at Vivian.

           THE ITALIAN GUEST

           Andiamo.

          Reverse angle shot on the lobby. Vivian keeps on walking quite

          fast, and barely avoids bumping into an uniformed hotel attendant

          loaded with luggage.

          Reverse angle shot on Barney still standing at the same place. He

          turns his head toward the desk.

                          BARNEY

           Miss Wilson, do you know that lady ?

                          MISS WILSON

           No, sir.

          Barney turns back toward the departing Vivian.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY

          Full shot of the building of the hotel.

          We hear the song Wild Women Do, performed by Natalie Cole.

                          LYRICS

           Wild women do. And they don't regret it.

          The camera pans down to street level and away from the hotel into

          Rodeo Drive.

          RODEO DRIVE - EXTERIOR DAY

          The camera pans along the expensive shop along Rodeo Drive. Many

          well-dressed people are walking on the sidewalk. Several are

          carrying bags from the shops.

                          LYRICS

           Wild women show what they're going through.

          The camera crosses the street on a crosswalk. Vivian is walking on

          this crosswalk.

                          LYRICS

           Ooh ! Wild women do what you think you'll never.

          Vivian looks at the pedestrians, so different from the ones she is

          used to see on Hollywood Boulevard.

          Several quick Close Up shots on various emblems above the shops :

          Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Diamonds on Rodeo Gucci

                          LYRICS

           What you only dream about wild women do.

          Mediums shot. Vivian stops near a jewel shops and looks in the

          window at the expensive jewels. She then moves away, looking

          around and smiling.

                          LYRICS

           Oh, yes, they do.

          Vivian keeps on walking looking up at the emblems. She apparently

          doesn't notice that several pedestrians are looking at her,

          surprised by her costume.

                          LYRICS

           You tell me you want a woman who is simple as a flower.

          Close shots on the beautiful clothes in the windows and then at

          Vivian smiling and looking at the clothes.

                          LYRICS

           Well, if you want me to act like that, you've got to pay me

           by the hour.

          A convertible BMV drives on the street. Both the male driver and

          the female passenger are talking on their cell phones.

          BOUTIQUE - INTERIOR DAY

          A very expensive boutique. A saleswoman and an old lady are

          seated on a sofa. The saleswoman is showing some items of clothing

          to the old lady. Through the window, we see Vivian walking toward

          the entrance of the shop.

                          LYRICS

           Wild women do and they don't regret it.

          Close shot on another saleswoman, who is arranging some flowers in

          a big vase. She is very neatly dressed and looks a bit snobbish.

          Vivian enters the shop. The saleswoman seated on the sofa looks up

          at her.

                          LYRICS

           Oh, wild women show what they're going through.

          A third saleswoman, wearing a black jacket and standing behind a

          counter, looks up at Vivian. The saleswoman, who is arranging the

          flowers, also looks at Vivian.

                          LYRICS

           Oooh-whoo ! Ooh, yeah.

          Vivian stops to look around and then walks to dresses hanging on a

          rail, and starts looking at them.

                          LYRICS

           Wild women do what you think you'll never.

          The music fades out.

          High angle shot on the whole shop. The saleswoman (Saleswoman #

          1), who was arranging the flower, is now standing behind Vivian.

                          SALESWOMAN # 1

           May I help you ?

                          VIVIAN

           Well, I'm just checking things out.

                          SALESWOMAN # 1

           Are you looking for something in particular ?

          Medium shot on Vivian and the saleswoman. Vivian has moved away

          from the hanging rail.

                          VIVIAN

           No. Well, yeah. Uh... something... conservative.

          She looks at a dummy wearing a very elegant suit. The saleswoman

          looks up and down at Vivian's costume, and answers with a forced

          smile.

                          SALESWOMAN # 1

           Yes.

          Vivian walks away to watch other items in the shop.

                          VIVIAN

           You got nice stuff.

                          SALESWOMAN # 1

           Thank you.

                          VIVIAN

           How much is this ?

          Vivian looks at another dummy wearing a very elegant light-colored

          dress. The saleswoman (Saleswoman # 2) with the black jacket has

          joined them.

                          SALESWOMAN # 1

           I don't think this would fit you.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it

           was.

          The saleswoman # 1 turns toward her colleague.

                          SALESWOMAN # 1

           How much is this, Marie ?

                          SALESWOMAN # 2

           It's very expensive.

                          SALESWOMAN # 1

           It's very expensive.

                          VIVIAN

           Look, I got money to spend in here.

          She starts walking nervously around the shop.

                          SALESWOMAN # 1

           I don't think we have anything for you. You're obviously in

           the wrong place. Please leave.

          The two saleswoman are staring at Vivian, who seems thunderstruck

          by this unexpected blow. She walks to the door, and leaves the

          shop.

          RODEO DRIVE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Vivian is walking on the sidewalk of Rodeo Drive, among the very

          elegantly dressed pedestrians. She has put her red jacket back on

          and is keeping it close to her waist with one hand. She walks very

          nervously, and her high heels don't help her to walk in a very

          elegant way.

          We catch snatches of the conversations taking place around Vivian.

                          WOMAN'S VOICE

           Doctor's office ? Two blocks down and to your left.

                          MAN'S VOICE

           Thank you.

          Vivian seems almost annoyed by those uninteresting bits of

          conversation. She keeps on walking.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY

          Full shot in front of the hotel. Vivian is crossing the street.

          Two businessmen in grey suits are talking just near the entrance

          of the hotel.

           ONE OF THE BUSINESSMEN

           Tiffany is taking the corner space. They like the project.

           We're very excited about the whole thing. Did you realize

           that Via Rodeo is the first new street... in Beverly Hills

           in seventy-five years ?

          Closer shot of Vivian entering the hotel under the surprised stare

          of the uniformed attendant at the door.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

          Vivian crosses the lobby. Barney, the manager, who was standing

          near the open door of an office, walks toward her.

                          BARNEY

           Excuse me, miss, may I help you ?

                          VIVIAN

           I'm going to my room.

          She keeps on walking and Barney follows her.

                          BARNEY

           Uh, do you have a key ?

          She stops walking and turns around to face Barney.

                          VIVIAN

           Oh. I forgot that cardboard thing. I'm on the top floor.

                          BARNEY

           You're a guest here ?

                          VIVIAN

           I'm with a friend.

                          BARNEY

           And who would that be ?

                          VIVIAN

           Edward.

                          BARNEY

           Edward ?

          The elevator bell dings and the elevator door opens.

                          VIVIAN

           Edward... Edward, uh...

          Barney nods his head.

                          BARNEY

           Mm-hmmm.

          Dennis comes out of the elevator. Vivian points at him.

                          VIVIAN

           He knows me.

          Barney turns toward Dennis.

                          BARNEY

           Dennis.

          Dennis walks toward his boss.

                          BARNEY

           Dennis, did you just come off the night shift ? Hmm ?

                          DENNIS

           Yes, sir.

          Barney buttons the collar of Dennis' uniform.

                          BARNEY

           Do you know this young lady ?

                          DENNIS

           She's with Mr. Lewis.

          Dennis speaks with a croaky voice, because Barney is slightly

          strangling him while buttoning his uniform.

                          BARNEY

           Mr. Lewis ?

                          VIVIAN

           That's it. Edward Lewis ! Thanks, Dennis.

          She slaps Dennis' shoulder, and moves into the elevator.

                          DENNIS

           Evidently she joined him last night.

                          BARNEY

           Thank you.

          Barney moves away from Dennis and joins Vivian into the elevator.

          Dennis puts his hands on his collar to open it and be able to

          breathe properly.

           VIVIAN (voice over from the elevator)

           Oh, God ! What now ? What ? What ?

          She comes out of the elevator, with Barney holding her elbow.

                          VIVIAN

           What is with everybody today ?

          They walk along the lobby, away from the elevator. Dennis looks at

          them and smiles. Two business men, going into the elevator, also

          look at them, surprised.

                          BARNEY

           No, no. It's all right. Just come with me. We'll have a

           little chat. Thank you. Dennis, thank you.

                          VIVIAN

           I'm coming. I'm coming.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - MANAGER'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY

          Close Up shot on a green plant, with, next to the plant, a metal

          pot that looks a bit like a coffee pot. Barney's hand takes the

          pot and starts watering the plant.

           BARNEY (voice over)

           Uh, what is your name, miss ?

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           What do you want it to be ?

          Full shot of the office. Vivian is seated on a leather armchair in

          front of an expensive-looking wooden desk, on which several

          documents are scattered. On the left-hand side of the desk, the

          total upper half of the wall is a large bay window protected from

          the outside by vertical Venetian blinds. Under the bay window, a

          small table on which is the plant Barney is watering.

                          BARNEY

           Don't play with me, young lady.

                          VIVIAN

           Vivian.

                          BARNEY

           Thank you. Vivian.

          Barney puts the pot down on the table and sits down on the desk

          itself just in front of Vivian.

                          BARNEY

           Well, Miss Vivian. Things that go on in other hotels don't

           happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Now, Mr. Lewis,

           however, is a very special customer, and we like to think

           of our special customers as friends. Now, as a customer, we

           would expect Mr. Lewis to sign in any additional guests,

           but as a friend, we're willing to overlook it. Now, I'm

           assuming that you're a...

          Barney bends his head down, and Vivian also bends her head down

          before answering.

                          BARNEY

           Relative ?

                          VIVIAN

           Yes.

                          BARNEY

           Mm-hmmm. I thought so. Then you must be his...

          Same game of bending heads down.

                          VIVIAN

           Niece ?

                          BARNEY

           Of course. Naturally, when Mr. Lewis leaves, I won't see

           you in this hotel again. I assume you have no other uncles

           here.

          Vivian shakes her head. She suddenly seems a bit tired by the

          situation.

                          BARNEY

           Good ! Then we understand each other. I would also

           encourage you... to dress a little more appropriately.

           that'll be all.

          Vivian raises her hands and her voice.

                          VIVIAN

           No, that's not all. That's what I was trying to do. I tried

           to go... get a dress on Rodeo Drive today, and the women

           wouldn't help me. And I have all this money now and no

           dress !

          Vivian takes the loose jumbled banknotes from her bag and shows

          them to Barney.

                          VIVIAN

           Not that I expect you to help me, but I have all of this,

           okay ? I have to buy a dress for dinner tonight. And nobody

           will help me.

          Barney takes the money out of Vivian's hands, then takes a white

          handkerchief out of the breast pocket of his jacket and gives it

          to Vivian. Then he gives her her money back.

          He walks around his desk, and picks up his telephone.

                          VIVIAN

           Oh, man, if you're calling the cops. Yeah, call the cops.

           That's great. Tell 'em I said hi.

                          BARNEY

           Women's clothing.

          Vivian looks up, a bit surprised.

                          BARNEY

           Bridget, please.

          Vivian looks at him, and then takes the handkerchief and loudly

          blows her nose.

                          BARNEY

           Yes, Bridget. Hello. This is Barnard Thompson here at the

           Regent Beverly Wil...

                          (HE CHUCKLES)

           Well, thank you. Yes, but I'd like you to do a favor for

           me, please. I'm sending someone over. Her name is Vivian.

          Vivian looks at him and smiles.

           BARNEY (voice over)

           She's a special guest. She's the niece of a very special

           guest.

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Full view of a screen, on which a film is being projected. This

          film shows an aerial overview of the port of Long Beach and Los

          Angeles, with a lot of industrial buildings along the wharves.

           PHILIP (voice over)

           Now, this is the jewel in Morse's crown : prime industrial

           properties straddling the port of Long Beach and Los

           Angeles.

          Full shot of the meeting room, with the screen in the background.

          Because of the dark in the room, people around the table are only

          shadows. Edward is standing up near the screen.

           PHILIP (voice over)

           The real estate possibilities are endless, but most of the

           yard we'll just level.

          A young man, one of Philip's assistants, walks into the room and

          to the place where Philip is seated. He bends down to whisper to

          Philip.

           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT

           We just got the information, Mr. Stuckey.

                          PHILIP

           Edward, we just got the Morse update. Don, can you hold the

           projection, please ?

          The projection stops. Philip stands up and switches the lights on.

          He sighs and turns toward the young man.

                          PHILIP

           Yeah, what ? Speak.

           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT

           Old Man Morse just got the inside track on a 350 million

           dollar contract to build destroyers for the Navy.

          Edward looks very pensive.

          Philip snickers, and looks at the young man.

                          PHILIP

           Navy contract. I can't believe this shit. I thought you

           said they had nothing in the hopper on this one !

           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT

           I thought they didn't.

          Shot on another man, named Mark, seated at the table.

                          MARK

           Hey, you know, if that's true it could cost a lot more.

           Those stocks could go through the roof.

                          PHILIP

           Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

          The young man walks toward Edward, still standing up.

           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT

           Maybe we're lucky to get this information now, sir. See, we

           can still walk away from it.

          Edward doesn't answer and remains pensive.

                          PHILIP

           Walk away ? Hey, forget it, pal. We got a thousand man-

           hours in on this ! Nobody's walking away from anything !

          Philip sits down at the table, next to Mark.

                          MARK

           Philip, I think he's right.

           PHILIP (raising his voice)

           Forget it, Mark.

          The two men start arguing, and since they are talking loudly

          together, we don't understand what they say.

          Edward, with a glass of water in his hand, comes to the table and

          raises his voice.

                          EDWARD

           Gentlemen, relax !

          The arguments between Philip and Mark stops

                          EDWARD

           Relax ! Who do we know on the Senate Appropriations

           Committee ?

                          PHILIP

           Senator Adams.

                          EDWARD

           All right, Senator Adams. Let's find out where he is.

          Philip stands up and the young man sits down in his chair.

                          EDWARD

           The Navy's not going to spend 350 million dollar on

           anything without going to Appropriations first.

          He drinks his water.

                          PHILIP

           I don't understand what's going on here today, gentlemen.

          The young man is on the phone, trying to reach someone.

           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT

           Hello ?

                          EDWARD

           That's why I hired you, Phil, to do my worrying for me.

          He picks up his briefcase.

                          EDWARD

           I'll be in your office. Bob, if you want to send over the

           geologicals ?

           BOB (voice over)

           No problem.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you.

          He goes out of the room. Philip follows him.

          Mark and the young blonde man sitting next to him are working on

          the documents in front of them.

           PHILIP (voice over)

           Edward.

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - RECEPTION HALL - INTERIOR DAY

          Edward is about to enter Philip's private office. Philip is

          standing behind him.

                          PHILIP

           Listen, everything all set for the meeting tonight ?

          Edward turns around to face Philip.

                          EDWARD

           Mm-hmm.

          We hear faint voices coming from the meeting room.

           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT (voice over)

           Yes, Senator Adams, please.

                          PHILIP

           Who... Who is this girl you're going with ?

           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT (voice over)

           Yes.

                          EDWARD

           Nobody you know.

          He enters Philip's private office. Philip turns around to go back

          in the meeting room, with a worried look on his face.

           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT (voice over)

           Yes, Edward Lewis Enterprises. Phil Stuckey. Yes, I have

           him right here.

                         DAY

          Full shot of the Women's clothing shop inside the hotel. Several

          women and even one man walking around. Counters and shelves full

          of women's clothing items. Hanging rails with dresses hanging on

          them.

          Vivian walks into the shop and starts looking around. Bridget

          comes into the shop with a Mrs Rainey, a customer.

                          BRIDGET

           Don't worry, Mrs. Rainey, I'll call you the minute it comes

           in.

                          MRS RAINEY

           Thank you.

                          BRIDGET

           Have a nice day.

                          MRS RAINEY

           Thank you.

          The customer walks away and Bridget stops near Vivian who is

          looking at something on a counter.

          Closer shot of Vivian looking at her teeth in a mirror set on the

          counter. She makes a face and brushes something off her teeth.

          Bridget bends over the mirror.

                          BRIDGET

           Hello. You must be Vivian. My name's Bridget.

          They shake hands.

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah, hi. Barney said you'd be nice to me.

          They both laugh.

                          BRIDGET

           He's very sweet. What are your plans while you're in town ?

                          VIVIAN

           We're gonna have dinner.

          She is ready to sit on the glass covering the counter, but Bridget

          prevents her from doing so.

                          BRIDGET

           Oh, don't sit on there, dear !

                          VIVIAN

           Oh !

                          BRIDGET

           You're gonna go out ? Dinner ?

                          VIVIAN

           Mm-hmm.

                          BRIDGET

           Well, you'll need a cocktail dress then. Come with me.

          Larger shot showing the whole shop.

                          BRIDGET

           Now, I'm sure we're gonna find something here that your

           uncle will love. You're a size six, right ?

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah. How'd you know that ?

                          BRIDGET

           Oh, that's my job.

          They start walking upstairs to the upper level.

                          VIVIAN

           Bridg, he's not really my uncle.

                          BRIDGET

           They never are, dear.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

          Barney is going around a huge bunch of flowers, followed by two

          Japanese, one male and one female. The man is speaking Japanese to

          Barney. Vivian walks between them, carrying a garment bag over her

          shoulder.

                          VIVIAN

           Barney !

          She quickly looks at the Japanese man.

                          VIVIAN

           Sorry, mister.

          Barney says a few words in Japanese to the Japanese guests.

                          VIVIAN

           I got a dress !

                          BARNEY

           Well, I'd rather hoped you'd be wearing it.

                          VIVIAN

           Oh, no, I didn't want to get it messed up ! Listen, I got

           shoes too. You wanna see ?

                          BARNEY

           No, that won't be necessary. I'm sure they're quite lovely.

           Thank you.

                          VIVIAN

           Okay, well, listen. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but

           Bridget was really great... and I just wanted to say

           thanks. You're cool.

                          BARNEY

           You're welcome, Miss Vivian.

          She walks away, and Barney looks at her, with a slight smile on

          his lips.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of Vivian entering the room. She closes the door

          behind her. The phone is ringing. We see the white telephone on a

          low table in the forefront of the screen. Vivian drops her handbag

          on the floor, rushes to the phone and picks it up.

                          VIVIAN

           Hello ?

          Medium shot of Edward, seen from the waist up, standing up in the

          reception hall of his office. He is on the phone. We occasionally

          see shadows of people moving behind him.

                          EDWARD

           Never, ever pick up the phone.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          VIVIAN

           Then why are you calling me ?

          She sits down.

           EDWARD (voicer over on the phone)

           Did you buy clothes today ?

          She squeezes the phone receiver between her head and her shoulder

          to have a better look at the garment bag.

                          VIVIAN

           I got a dress. A cocktail one.

           EDWARD (voicer over on the phone)

           That's good.

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - RECEPTION HALL - INTERIOR DAY

                          EDWARD

           I'll be in the hotel lobby, 7:45 sharp.

           VIVIAN (voicer over on the phone)

           What ? You're not coming up to the door ?

                          EDWARD

           This isn't a date. It's business.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          VIVIAN

           Where are you taking me, anyway ?

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - RECEPTION HALL - INTERIOR DAY

                          EDWARD

           I'm taking you to a restaurant called the Voltaire.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

           EDWARD (voicer over on the phone)

           Very elegant.

                          VIVIAN

           All right. I'll meet you in the lobby, but only 'cause

           you're paying me to.

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - RECEPTION HALL - INTERIOR DAY

                          EDWARD

           Well, thank you very much.

          He puts the phone down.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Vivian also puts the phone down and smiles.

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - RECEPTION HALL - INTERIOR DAY

          Larger shot of the reception hall. We discover that Edward is

          standing near the reception desk, behind which a female

          receptionist is sitting. Behind her on the wall, a logo and

          underneath it : Lewis enterprises, inc., and below : Philip

          Stuckey - Attorney.

           EDWARD (to the receptionist)

           Get her back for me, please.

          The receptionist picks up the phone and starts dialing.

          A blonde female secretary walks behind Edward and bends down to

          speak to him.

                          THE SECRETARY

           Mr. Stuckey wanted to see you.

                          EDWARD

           Yes, tell him I'm in the middle of a very important phone

           call.

          The secretary walks away.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          The phone rings. Vivian walks to the low table to pick it up.

                          VIVIAN

           Hello ?

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - RECEPTION HALL - INTERIOR DAY

           EDWARD (smiling on the phone)

           I told you not to pick up the phone.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          VIVIAN

           Then stop calling me.

          Edward laughs and puts the phone down.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Vivian also puts the phone down.

                          VIVIAN

           Sick.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of Barney standing up in the lobby with his back to

          us. One of his assistant, wearing a dark suit, crosses the lobby,

          followed by an uniformed attendant.

          Vivian rushes toward Barney.

                          VIVIAN

           Barney !

          Barney looks at her and notices she is still wearing her

          prostitute costume.

                          BARNEY

           It didn't fit ?

                          VIVIAN

           Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Uh... I've got a little problem.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          High Angle Close Up Shot on a dinner table, showing a white china

          plate with a smaller plate inside, and on either sides of the

          plates, a full set of silver cutlery (three forks of various sizes

          on the left-hand side of the plate, and a knife and three spoons

          on the other side). In front of the plate, a napkin folded in a

          glass.

           BARNEY (voice over)

           All right, Miss Vivian, one more time. Dinner napkin.

          We see Vivian's hand taking the napkin.

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           Dinner napkin...

           BARNEY (voice over)

                          MM-MMM

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           ...laid gently in the lap.

          The camera pans away and we discover Vivian seated at the table in

          front of the plate. She puts the napkin on her laps and then her

          elbows on the table

           BARNEY (voice over)

           Good. Elbows off the table.

          She takes her elbows off the table.

           BARNEY (voice over)

           Don't slouch.

          The camera moves away from the table and we get a larger shot of

          the dining room. Uniformed waiters are setting tables behind

          Vivian and Barney, who is standing up behind Vivian. He points to

          the different forks on the table.

                          BARNEY

           Shrimp fork, salad fork, dinner fork.

                          VIVIAN

           I definitely have the salad fork. The rest of the

           silverware is a little confusing.

          The camera moves back again giving a full view of the dining room,

          with Barney and Vivian's table in the forefront. A black case is

          open on the table : inside a impressive collection of silver

          cutlery.

          Barney picks up the different forks and shows them to Vivian.

                          BARNEY

           All right, if you get nervous, just count the tines. Four

           tines : dinner fork. And sometimes there are three tines in

           the salad fork. And sometimes...

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON

          A large grey limousine is driving slowly on Rodeo Drive, and comes

          to park in front of the hotel.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON

          Edward crosses the lobby, carrying his briefcase. He stops to look

          around, expecting to see Vivian waiting for him. He starts walking

          again, still looking around him. Barney catches up with him.

          Edward doesn't stop walking, and Barney has to talk while walking.

                          BARNEY

           Pardon me, Mr. Lewis. I'm Mr. Thompson. I'm the manager of

           the hotel.

          Edward stops at a marble shelf with a row of courtesy telephones

          on it. He hardly listens to what Barney is telling him.

                          EDWARD

           Uh-huh. Excuse me, I just want to make one call.

          He picks up a telephone but keeps looking around him. He seems a

          bit worried.

                          BARNEY

           Yes, um, sir. I have a message for you, sir.

                          EDWARD

           From who ?

                          BARNEY

           From your niece, sir.

          Edward, for the first time, looks at Barney. His finger is on the

          dial of the phone, but he doesn't dial.

                          EDWARD

           My what ?

                          BARNEY

           The young lady who's staying with you in your room, sir.

                          EDWARD

           Oh. Hmm.

          Edward smiles and puts down the telephone receiver which he had

          already put to his ear.

                          EDWARD

           I think we both know that she's not my niece.

                          BARNEY

           Of course.

                          EDWARD

           The reason I know that is that I am an only child.

                          BARNEY

           Yes, sir.

                          EDWARD

           What's the message ?

                          BARNEY

           She's waiting for you in the lounge. Intriguing young lady,

           Miss Vivian.

          Edward remains pensive for a couple of seconds before answering.

                          EDWARD

           Intriguing.

          Edward picks up his briefcase which he had put on the telephone

          shelf.

                          BARNEY

           Have a good evening, sir.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you, Mr... ?

          He walks away.

                          BARNEY

           Thompson. I'm the manager...

          He takes his business card out of the pocket of his vest to give

          it to Edward, but Edward is already gone.

                          BARNEY

           ...manager of the hotel, sir.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOUNGE - INTERIOR NIGHT

          The lounge of the hotel is a cosy place with potted green plants,

          comfortable armchair and soft piano music.

          Medium shot of Edward entering the lounge. The camera then follows

          Edward crossing the lounge toward the bar.

          Larger shot of the lounge, with the bar in the background. There

          are not many people at this early time of the evening.

          Medium shot of the bar. Only one person is seated on a stool at

          the bar. Even if we see only her back, we guess she is Vivian. But

          Edward doesn't seem to recognize her, because he keeps looking

          around for her.

          As Edward is looking the other way from the bar, Vivian turns

          around and looks at him. Edward walks a couple of steps toward the

          door, and then turns around and eventually notices Vivian.

          Medium shot on Edward. There is a look of surprise in Edward's

          eyes when he recognizes Vivian.

          Back to Vivian still seated at the bar. She doesn't look like the

          Vivian we were used to see. She is wearing a very elegant dark-

          colored cocktail dress. Her hair also has been very elegantly

          styled.

          Edward looks at her without moving for a few seconds.

          She stands up from the bar and walks toward him.

                          VIVIAN

           You're late.

                          EDWARD

           You're stunning.

          She laughs.

                          VIVIAN

           You're forgiven.

                          EDWARD

           Shall we go to dinner ?

          He gives her his arm. She puts her arm inside his arm and they

          walk across the lounge toward the exit.

          RESTAURANT LE VOLTAIRE - INTERIOR NIGHT

          High angle shot of the whole restaurant. It looks like a very

          expensive place. Tables are scattered around the room and on the

          gallery, but not too close to one another. In the middle of the

          room, a larger table used only by the waiters.

          We see Edward and Vivian crossing the room, with a maitre d'hotel

          walking in front of them.

                          MAITRE D'HOTEL

           This way, Mr. Lewis. Your party is waiting.

                          EDWARD

           Stop fidgeting.

          Closer high angle shot of Vivian and Edward walking toward a table

          where two men, an old one and a younger one, are already seated.

                          EDWARD

           Mr. Morse.

          The two men stand up. The older one is James Jim Morse and the

          younger one is his grandson, David Morse.

                          JAMES MORSE

           Yes, Mr. Lewis. I'm Jim Morse.

          They shake hands.

                          JAMES MORSE

           This fireball is my grandson, David.

                          DAVID MORSE

           Well, I don't know about the fireball part, but grandson is

           true enough.

                          EDWARD

           I'm pleased to meet you both. This is a friend of mine,

           Vivian Ward.

                          VIVIAN

           Hi. I'm really glad to meet you.

                          EDWARD

           Mr. Morse. David.

          She shakes hands with both men.

                          EDWARD

           Please, sit.

          The maitre d'hotel pulls the chair for Vivian. The men wait for

          Vivian to be seated to sit down. Vivian has James Morse on her

          right, Edward on her left, and David in front of her.

                          VIVIAN (SOFTLY)

           Excuse me.

          She stands up. Immediately, the maitre d'hotel pulls her chair,

          and the three men stand up, to Vivian's surprise.

                          EDWARD

           Where are you going ?

          She smiles to the two other men.

                          VIVIAN

           I'm going to the ladies' room.

          The two Morse men smile back to her.

                          EDWARD

           Upstairs, to the right.

                          VIVIAN

           Okay. Excuse me.

          She starts walking away.

                          EDWARD

           Shall I order for you ?

          She turns around.

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah.

          She stops, exhales, and says, in a more polite tone :

                          VIVIAN

           Please do so. Thank you.

                          EDWARD

           I'll do that.

          She walks away. The three men sit down.

          Close Up shot on a plate being laid in front of one of the guests.

          On the plate, four appetizers, actually four canapes.

           DAVID MORSE (voice over)

           Mr. Lewis, my grandfather believes the men who create a

           company...

          The camera moves up from the plate to the guest's face. The guest

          is Vivian, and she looks a bit worried by what has been brought to

          her.

           DAVID MORSE (voice over)

           ...should control its destiny.

          Vivian turns to Edward.

                          VIVIAN

           Where's the salad ?

          David looks at Vivian, a bit surprised by what she just said.

          Edward whispers to Vivian

                          EDWARD

           Uh, the salad comes at the end of the meal.

                          VIVIAN

           That's the fork I knew.

          David smiles.

          Vivian takes one of her forks and looks at it, then she puts it

          back.

           DAVID MORSE (voice over)

           Let me, uh, put it another way. Between your public

           statements and the rumors flying around on this thing, we

           find it very hard to figure out what your real intentions

           are.

          Sensing Vivian's embarrassment, James Morse smiles to her.

                          JAMES MORSE

           I don't know about you, but I've never been able to figure

           which goes with what !

          He points to the different forks around his plate. Vivian laughs.

          David seems a bit annoyed by the fact that the conversation keeps

          on deviating on menial subjects.

          James Morse takes one of the canapes with his fingers and eats it.

          Vivian smiles, and also takes the canape with her fingers. She

          wipes something out of it before eating it.

          Edward smiles. He is happy that Vivian and James are getting along

          so well.

          Close Up on the table in front of Vivian. We see the waiter's hand

          putting down a plate of snails in their shells.

           DAVID MORSE (voice over)

           You know, there was a time when we built ships the size of

           cities. Men like my grandfather made this country.

          Vivian looks at the snails and then at the waiter.

                          VIVIAN

           Who ordered this ?

          David seems more and more annoyed by the situation with Vivian.

           THE WAITER (voice over)

           The gentleman did, ma'am. Bon appetit.

          Edward looks at Vivian.

                          EDWARD

           These are escargot. It's French for snails. It's a

           delicacy. Try it. David ?

          David bends down on the table. His grandfather looks at him.

                          DAVID MORSE

           Mr. Lewis, if you were to get control... and I don't think

           you will... but if you did, what do you plan to do with the

           company ?

          Vivian is trying to figure out how to work the snail pincers.

          Edward looks at David

                          EDWARD

           Break it up and sell off the pieces.

          Edward is trying to mime to Vivian how to use the snail pincers.

          Closer shot on James Morse.

                          JAMES MORSE

           I'm sure you'll understand I'm not thrilled at the idea...

           of your turning forty years of my work into your garage

           sale.

          Vivian is still fighting with her snail pincers.

          Close Up on Vivian's plate and her hands trying to use the snail

          pincers.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           At the price I'm paying for this stock, Mr. Morse, you are

           going to be a very rich man.

          James Morse looks at Edward.

                          JAMES MORSE

           I'm rich enough. I just want to head my shipyard.

          Eventually, Vivian had succeeded in fitting one snail into the

          snail pincers, but it flies away from the pincers.

          The waiter, a white-hair man with a gentle face, catches it.

          Edward looks at the waiter and then at Vivian.

                         VIVIAN SMILES

                          VIVIAN

           Slippery little suckers.

          Both Morse gentlemen smile.

           THE WAITER (smiling)

           It happens all the time.

          Close Up on the table in front of Vivian. A ball of green ice

          cream, in a silver cup, is being put down on the table.

          Medium shot on the Morse gentlemen.

                          JAMES MORSE

           I met your father. What's his name ?

                          EDWARD

           Carter.

          Vivian bits in a piece of leaf that was on the table, makes a

          face, and takes it out of her mouth.

           JAMES MORSE (voice over)

           Yeah. Carter. Carter Lewis.

          Medium shot on James Morse. Then medium shots on whomever is

          talking.

                          JAMES MORSE

           He's not quite the bastard everybody says he is.

                          EDWARD

           No, I have the franchise on that.

                          JAMES MORSE

           Does that make him proud ?

                          EDWARD

           I doubt it. It doesn't really matter now. He passed away.

                          JAMES MORSE

           Oh, I hadn't heard. I'm sorry.

                          VIVIAN

           I'm sorry too.

                          EDWARD

           Mr. Morse, you asked for this meeting. What can I do for

           you ?

                          JAMES MORSE

           Leave my company alone.

                          EDWARD

           I can't do that. I own ten million shares.

                          JAMES MORSE

           I'll buy your stock back.

                          EDWARD

           You don't have the money.

                          DAVID MORSE

           We will. We're getting a contract to build ten destroyers.

                          EDWARD

           There will be no contract. The contract is now buried in

           Appropriations Committee. And it will remain there.

                          DAVID MORSE

           And how the hell did you pull something like that ? You got

           dirty politicians in your pockets now or something ?

           JAMES MORSE (voice over)

           Easy, easy, calm down. Calm down, David.

          Quick shots at Edward with a slight ironical smile on his face,

          and then at Vivian, looking embarrassed.

                          JAMES MORSE

           Mr. Lewis plays hardball.

                          EDWARD

           Yes, yes, I do.

          David slams his napkin on the table

                          DAVID MORSE

           I've heard enough of this. Vivian, it was a great pleasure

           to meet you. I'm sorry, Grandfather. I've gotta get some

           air. Mr. Lewis.

          He stands up and walks away.

                          JAMES MORSE

           I'd better join my grandson. You two enjoy your dinner.

          He stands up.

                          JAMES MORSE

           I'm sure it'll be delicious. Good luck, miss.

          Edward stands up. James Morse comes close to him.

                          JAMES MORSE

           Watch out, Lewis. I'm gonna tear you apart.

                          EDWARD

           I look forward to it, sir.

          He walks away.

          Vivian looks more and more embarrassed.

                          EDWARD

           Rich people throw their napkins a lot, don't they ?

          He sits down.

                          VIVIAN

           He seems like a nice man.

                          EDWARD

           I guess three thousand dollars does not buy loyalty, does

           it ?

                          VIVIAN

           I just mean it's sweet the way he's crazy about his

           grandson.

          Two waiters puts down plates in front of Edward and Vivian.

                          EDWARD

           Oh, his grandson thinks he's a relic. He hates that he

           does, but he does.

          He makes a sign to the waiters who were wondering about the

          missing guests.

                          EDWARD

           No, just the two.

           THE WAITER (voice over)

           Yes, sir.

          From her purse, Vivian takes out a little ketchup sealed pack, as

          found in fast food restaurants, and starts tearing it open.

          Edwards looks at her and smiles.

          Close Up on Vivian's plate, where there are a piece of meat, a cob

          of corn, a jacket potato sliced in two halves, and some salad. We

          see Vivian's hand pouring ketchup from the pack on her meat.

          Medium shot on the maitre d'hotel walking toward the waiter and

          whispering in his ear. The waiter nods his head toward Vivian.

          Close Up on Vivian's plate. She spread the ketchup on her meat

          with her fork.

          The maitre d'hotel walks away, bobbing his head in a deprecating

          manner.

          Vivian looks around and senses that something is wrong.

          Edward smiles and looks at the waiter.

                          VIVIAN

           It's ketchup.

          The waiter smiles.

                          THE WAITER

           Yes, sir.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           Check, please.

                          THE WAITER

           Yes, sir.

          The waiter walks away to get the check.

                          VIVIAN

           Haven't they ever seen ketchup before ?

                          EDWARD

           Not in this building.

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           Edward ?

          PENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Edward, still wearing his jacket and tie, is seated at the

          entrance of the terrace, the back of his chair against the open

          French window.

          Vivian walks toward him, still wearing her cocktail dress.

                          VIVIAN

           Edward, you said you never come out here.

          He looks down at the feet of his chair.

                          EDWARD

           Well, I'm only halfway out.

                          VIVIAN

           Didn't say much in the car on the way home. You thinking

           about dinner ? I was a maniac.

                          VIVIAN

           I mean, the business was good, I think. You know ?

          Vivian sits down on the balustrade of the terrace.

                          VIVIAN

           He's in trouble. You want his company. He doesn't want to

           let it go.

                          EDWARD

           Thanks for the recap.

                          VIVIAN

           The problem is, I think you liked Mr. Morse.

          PENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Edward points his finger toward Vivian.

                          EDWARD

           What I would like is for you to get down from there. You're

           making me very nervous. Please come down.

                          VIVIAN

           It's making you nervous ? What if I just leaned back a

           little bit like this ?

          She starts leaning back a little.

                          VIVIAN

           Would you... Would you rescue me if I fell ?

                          EDWARD

           Vivian, I'm serious. Come... I'm not looking.

                          VIVIAN

           It's really high.

          She takes her hands off the balustrade, and waves them up in the

          air.

                          VIVIAN

           Look, no hands, no hands ! Okay, all right. I'm sorry.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          The terrace seen from the open French window.

          She sits back and holds the balustrade with both hands.

                          EDWARD

           The truth is, it really is totally irrelevant whether I

           like this man or not.

          PENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

                          EDWARD

           I will not let myself become emotionally involved in

           business.

                          VIVIAN

           I know. Kit's always saying to me, Don't get emotional

           when you turn tricks. That's why no kissing. It's too

           personal.

          Edward is smiling.

                          VIVIAN

           It's like what you're saying : You stay numb, you don't get

           involved. When I'm with a guy, I'm like a robot. I just do

           it.

          Edward looks at her with an ironical smile on his face.

          Vivian sighs and smiles.

                          VIVIAN

           I mean... except with you.

                          EDWARD

           Oh, of course, not with me. You and I are such similar

           creatures, Vivian. We both screw people for money.

          Vivian looks embarrassed.

                          VIVIAN

           I was sorry to hear about your dad. When did he die ?

                          EDWARD

           Last month.

                          VIVIAN

           Do you miss him ?

                          EDWARD

           I hadn't spoken to him in fourteen and a half years. I

           wasn't there when he died.

                          VIVIAN

           Do you want to talk about this ?

                          EDWARD

           No.

          The terrace seen from the open French window.

          Vivian drops down from the balustrade, walks toward Edward and

          kneels down beside his chair.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, I tell you what, 'cause I got an idea.

          PENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Close Shot of Edward and Vivian.

                          VIVIAN

           Let's watch old movies all night. We'll just veg out in

           front of the TV.

                          EDWARD

           Veg out ?

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah. Be still like vegetables. Lay like broccoli.

          He stands up.

                          EDWARD

           Look, I'll tell you what. I'll be back. We'll do broccoli

           tomorrow.

          He strokes her chin very delicately. She stands up.

                          VIVIAN

           Where are you going ?

                          EDWARD

           I'm going downstairs for a while.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Later in the night.

          Close Up on the TV screen. We see the closing scene of the film

          Charade, directed in 1963 by musical comedy actor Stanley Donen.

          Regina (played by Audrey Hepburn) is talking with Peter (played by

          Cary Grant).

           REGINA (voice over from the TV)

           Did you say marriage license ?

           PETER (voice over from the TV)

           Now, don't change the subject, just give me the stamp.

          Regina throws her arms around Peter's neck

           REGINA (voice over from the TV)

           Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter, Brian, whatever your

           name is.

          The picture from the film, who was filling the whole TV screen,

          suddenly becomes a smaller one in the center of the TV screen.

          Four other pictures, from four other films, appears in each corner

          of the TV screen.

           REGINA (voice over from the TV)

           Oh, I love you.

          The camera moves back and we see the back of the sofa. There is

          some stirring in the sofa, and we see Vivian's arm holding the

          remote control and pressing on a button. The TV shuts off.

          Close Up on Vivian's hand putting the remote control down next to

          a clock that says three o'clock.

          Medium shot on Vivian, wearing a white bathrobe, and putting her

          hand through her hair. She picks up the telephone next to the

          sofa, and presses a button on the telephone set.

                          VIVIAN

           Hi, uh, I'm in the penthouse. The guy that was here, Mr.

           Lewis, have you seen him down there anywhere ?

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot on the door of the elevator. It opens, revealing

          Dennis, the elevator attendant, and, behind him, Vivian in her

          white bathrobe. He takes her by the arm and guides her away from

          the elevator.

          They cross the lobby, where, at this time of the night, there are

          only uniformed maids cleaning the place. Dennis guides Vivian to

          the door of a room, from which piano music is coming out.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - MUSIC LOUNGE - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Full shot of the room, which is very dark. In the background, we

          see a stage with music stands on it. In front of the stage,

          Edward, in shirtsleeves, is playing on a concert piano.

          Closer shot on Edward playing the piano.

          The actor Richard Gere, who plays the character of Edward,

          actually plays live on the piano in that sequence. More, he

          composed the piece he is playing.

          Medium shot on the cleaning crew listening to him while working.

          Vivian walks slowly toward the piano.

          She stops behind Edward and folds her arms. Edward stops playing.

          Full shot of the room. The cleaning crew applauds Edward. Vivian

          walks closer to the piano.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you. Thank you very much.

                          VIVIAN

           I didn't know you played.

                          EDWARD

           I only play for strangers.

          Closer shot on the piano. Vivian leans on the piano.

                          VIVIAN

           I was getting lonely upstairs all by myself.

          Edward turns around.

                          EDWARD

           Gentlemen, would you mind leaving us, please ?

          Full shot of the room. The cleaning crew is leaving the room.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you.

          Close Up shot on Vivian's face.

                          VIVIAN

           People always do what you tell them to do ?

          Medium shot. Edward grabs Vivian by the waist and sets her in

          front of him. We hear the piano keys as they are pounded by

          Vivian's buttocks. Edward puts his forehead on Vivian's belly.

          Vivian, her hand on his hair, looks down at him, with a strange

          expression in her eyes.

          Edward looks up and starts untying Vivian's bathrobe belt. Under

          the bathrobe, Vivian is still wearing her cocktail dress.

          Close Up on Vivian's face as Edward lifts her dress up.

                          VIVIAN

           I guess so.

          Edward grabs her, lifts her, and sits her on the piano. We hear

          the piano keys being pounded by Vivian's feet.

          Edward strokes her hair. He wants to kiss her, but she moves away.

          Eventually, she puts her head into his neck, and kisses him on the

          neck.

          The bathrobe has fallen down on the piano. Edward spreads Vivian's

          legs apart, and squeezes himself between those open legs.

          Vivian lies down on the piano, while Edward is having sex with

          her.

          The camera slowly moves away from the piano, giving us a full shot

          of the entire room.

          We hear the piano key being pounded, and the camera goes down

          behind some unspecified piece of furniture, making a fade-out to

          black screen.

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Vivian is asleep in bed. We hear the curtains being pulled, and we

          see the daylight coming on Vivian's face. Vivian wakes up, scratch

          her head and looks around her.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           Wake up. Time to shop.

          Edward sits on the bed, and Vivian turns around to face him.

          Edward has a MasterCard in his hand. He shows it to Vivian.

                          EDWARD

           Now, if you have any trouble using this card, have them

           call the hotel. All right ?

          Vivian takes the card and sits up in bed.

                          VIVIAN

           Oh ! More shopping.

          Edward ties his shoelaces.

                          EDWARD

           Mm-hmm. I'm surprised you didn't buy more than one dress

           yesterday.

                          VIVIAN

           Wasn't as much fun as I thought it was gonna be.

                          EDWARD

           Why not ?

                          VIVIAN

           They were mean to me.

                          EDWARD

           Mean to you ?

          Edward looks very surprised. Vivian nods Yes.

          RODEO DRIVE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Medium full shot of Edward and Vivian crossing the street, holding

          hands. Vivian is still wearing her blue very short skirt, but the

          upper half of her body is covered by a white shirt, knotted at the

          waist and with the sleeves rolled back on her arms. She is also

          wearing regular woman's shoes, so she doesn't look like a

          prostitute any more.

                          VIVIAN

           People are looking at me.

          They now walk on the sidewalk.

                          EDWARD

           They're not looking at you. They're looking at me.

                          VIVIAN

           The stores are not nice to people. I don't like it.

                          EDWARD

           Stores are never nice to people. They're nice to credit

           cards.

          He stops walking and Vivian also stops.

                          EDWARD

           Okay, stop fidgeting.

                          VIVIAN

           All right.

                          EDWARD

           Get rid of your gum.

          She spits her gum, almost hitting two female pedestrians. One of

          them jumps up.

                          EDWARD

           I don't believe you did that.

          Edward pulls her by the hand and they enter an expensive clothing

          store.

          CLOTHING STORE - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of Vivian and Edward standing near a hanging rail full

          of dresses. Edward is holding Vivian's hand, who seems a little

          embarrassed. A young well-dressed man approaches them : he is Mr.

          Hollister, the manager of the store.

                          EDWARD

           Yes ?

                          HOLLISTER

           I am Mr. Hollister, the manager. May I help you ?

          Edward shakes hand with him.

                          EDWARD

           Edward Lewis.

                          HOLLISTER

           Ah, yes, sir.

                          EDWARD

           You see this young lady over here ?

          Vivian joins the two men with a broad smile.

                          HOLLISTER

           Yes.

                          EDWARD

           Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is ?

          Vivian puts her head on Edward's shoulder.

                          HOLLISTER

           Oh, yes.

          Hollister understand he has made a blunder.

                          HOLLISTER

           Oh, no ! No, no, no, I'm saying we have many things as

           beautiful as she would want them to be. That's the point I

           was getting at, and I think we can all agree with that.

           That's why when you came in...

          Edward takes Hollister's elbow and walks slightly away.

                          EDWARD

           Excuse me. You know what we're gonna need here ?

                          HOLLISTER

           ...we knew from the first...

                          EDWARD

           We're gonna need a few more people helping us. I'll tell

           you why. We're going to be spending an obscene amount of

           money in here. So we're going to need a lot more help

           sucking up to us. That's what we really like. You

           understand that.

          Vivian smiles behind Edward.

                          HOLLISTER

           Sir, if I may say so, you're in the right store and the

           right city for that matter.

          Later.

          Medium shot of Vivian seated in a comfortable armchair with a

          catalogue on her laps and Hollister kneeling at her side.

                          HOLLISTER

           Anything you see here, we can do, by the way. Get ready to

           have some fun. Okay ?

          Vivian smiles.

                          VIVIAN

           Okay.

          Hollister makes a sign with his hand.

          Full shot of the store. In the forefront, Edward is standing

          behind a counter with a cordless telephone in his hand. He dials

          on the telephone.

                          HOLLISTER

           Mary Pat, Mary Kate, Mary Francis, Tovah, let's see it !

          He stands up. A saleswoman is running toward Vivian with a dress

          in her hands. She puts it on Vivian's laps, who puts the catalogue

          away.

                          HOLLISTER

           Come on. Bring it out, girls.

                          THE SALESWOMAN

           Oh, this is absolutely divine.

          Another saleswoman, also with a dress in her hand, is coming from

          the other side.

          Medium shot on Edward behind the counter. In the background, we

          hear female voices, but we don't understand the words.

          Hollister walks toward Edward.

                          HOLLISTER

           Excuse me, sir, uh,

                          EDWARD

           Yeah ?

                          HOLLISTER

           Exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking

           about ? Just profane or really offensive ?

                          EDWARD

           Really offensive.

                          HOLLISTER

           I like him so much !

          Edward takes the phone to his ear, and Hollister walks away.

          We hear the orchestral music from the title song : Pretty Woman

          Vivian is still seated on her armchair, looking at all the clothes

          that the saleswomen are bringing to her.

          She has a very bright red dress in her hand and she looks at

          Edward.

          Edward makes a face and nods No.

          A saleswoman put a black hat on Vivian's head.

          Edward smiles and nods Yes.

          Hollister sits down near Vivian and a saleswoman brings a grey

          dress. Vivian points to the dress and looks at Edward.

          Edward makes a face and a So-So sign with his hand.

          Slightly later.

          Edward is standing near the counter, drinking coffee. In the

          background, we see Vivian surrounded by saleswomen. Hollister

          walks toward Edward.

          The music stops.

                          HOLLISTER

           Mr. Lewis, sir. Mr. Lewis, how's it going so far ? Pretty

           well, I think.

                          EDWARD

           I think we need some major sucking up.

                          HOLLISTER

           Very well, sir. You're not only handsome, but a powerful

           man. I could see the second you walked in here, you were

           someone to reckon with...

          Edward has put the coffee cup down and has taken the telephone

          again. He turns toward Hollister.

                          EDWARD

           Hollister.

                          HOLLISTER

           Yes, sir.

                          EDWARD

           Not me. Her.

          He points toward the group of saleswomen surrounding Vivian.

                          HOLLISTER

           I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

          He walks away from Edward and toward the group of saleswomen.

                          HOLLISTER

           How we doing, ladies ?

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - PHILIP'S ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Philip sits down behind his desk and talks into the hand-free

          telephone.

                          PHILIP

           Oh, Edward, Edward. Where the hell are you ? The word's all

           over the street.

           Morse is gonna raise your offer, pal.

                          EDWARD

           He's countering ?

                          (LAUGHING)

           get the money ?

                          PHILIP

           I don't know. He, uh... I think he's throwing in with the

           employees.

          CLOTHING STORE - INTERIOR DAY

                          EDWARD

           EDWARD (voice over on the phone)

           Find out who it is. I'll be in the office in an hour.

                          PHILIP

           Yeah, okay. You got it.

          He presses a button on the telephone set to cut the call.

          CLOTHING STORE - INTERIOR DAY

          Edward gives his credit card to Vivian. Vivian is now dressed in a

          very elegant brown suit, with a grey shirt underneath.

                          EDWARD

           You're on your own. I have to go back to work. You look

           great !

          He walks toward the exit of the store, and near Hollister.

                          EDWARD

           She has my card.

                          HOLLISTER

           And we'll help her use it, sir.

          Slightly later.

          We hear the song Oh, Pretty Woman, performed by Roy Orbison.

          Vivian, wearing a black short dress, is dancing on the rhythm of

          the music, surrounded by two saleswomen.

                          LYRICS

           Pretty woman walking down the street.

          Vivian comes out of a dressing cubicle, wearing a black sweater

          and brown pants.

                          LYRICS

           Pretty woman the kind I like to meet. Pretty woman.

           I don't believe you. You're not the truth.

          Vivian, wearing a light pink suit, whirls round.

           No one could look as good as you. Mercy.

          Vivian, wearing a white blouse, looks at some pieces of lingerie.

          Vivian, wearing a brown dress with white dots, whirls round.

          Close Up of Vivian's leg putting hoses on.

          The volume of the music goes down.

          Another department of the store : the shoe department. Vivian,

          wearing a white suit with thin vertical stripes, is surrounded by

          shoes. Hollister is kneeling beside her, and a salesman is helping

          her try a new pair of shoes. Vivian smiles and looks at the

          necktie worn by the salesman.

                          VIVIAN

           Edward would love that tie.

          Hollister turns toward his salesman.

                          HOLLISTER

           Would you give her the tie ?

                          THE SALESMAN

           The tie ?

                          HOLLISTER

           Take off the tie. Give her the tie.

                          THE SALESMAN

           The tie.

          He starts taking off his tie.

                          HOLLISTER

           He really wants to do this, by the way.

                          VIVIAN

           He would go crazy about this tie.

          A saleswoman walks toward them, carrying a large pizza in an open

          cardboard box. Hollister looks worried.

                          HOLLISTER

           Who ordered pizza ?

          But Vivian seems very happy about the pizza.

          The volume of the music goes back up.

          RODEO DRIVE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Close Up on a white parasol with flowers printed on it, looking a

          bit Japanese. The parasol moves away from us and we discovers we

          are back on Rodeo Drive.

                          LYRICS

           Pretty woman, stop a while.

          The camera moves away from the parasol, and Vivian appears on the

          screen. She is wearing a very elegant white suit, long white

          gloves, and a black hat.

                          LYRICS

           Pretty woman, talk a while. Pretty woman give your smile to

          The camera backs up away from Vivian, and we notice she is

          carrying several bags, certainly full of clothes. Men turn their

          head to look at her.

                          LYRICS

           Pretty woman Yeah, yeah, yeah.

          BOUTIQUE - INTERIOR DAY

          We are back inside the boutique, from which Vivian was very rudely

          ejected, the day before, by some snobbish saleswomen. Through the

          shop window, we see Vivian walking on the sidewalk.

          She stops and looks inside the boutique.

                          LYRICS

           Pretty woman, look my way.

          The camera moves from the window to the street door of the

          boutique.

                          LYRICS

           Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me.

          The volume of the music goes down, as Vivian enters the shop.

          Saleswoman # 2 walks toward her.

                          SALESWOMAN # 2

           May I help you ?

                          VIVIAN

           No, thank you.

          Vivian keeps on walking until she reaches Saleswoman # 1, who is

          working on a hanging rail. Saleswoman # 1 was the one who actually

          ejected Vivian from the boutique.

                          VIVIAN

           Hi.

                          SALESWOMAN # 1

           Hello.

          The saleswoman has a broad smile.

                          VIVIAN

           Do you remember me ?

          Apparently, the saleswoman doesn't recognize this very elegant

          woman as being the one she was rude to the day before.

                          SALESWOMAN # 1

           No, I'm sorry.

                          VIVIAN

           I was in here yesterday. You wouldn't wait on me.

                          SALESWOMAN # 1

           Oh.

                          VIVIAN

           You work on commission, right ?

                          SALESWOMAN # 1

           Uh, yes.

          Vivian shows her all the bags she is carrying.

                          VIVIAN

           Big mistake. Big. Huge ! I have to go shopping now.

          She walks away, leaving the saleswoman with a very surprised look

          on her face.

          The volume of the music goes back up.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

          A uniformed attendant enters the lobby, carrying Vivian's shopping

          bags. Behind him Vivian walks in.

                          LYRICS

           Pretty woman don't walk on by.

          The camera moves across the lobby, until it reaches Barney, the

          managers, talking to two of his employees, one uniformed male and

          one female. He has not noticed Vivian yet, because she is coming

          behind him.

                          LYRICS

           Pretty woman don't make me cry. Pretty woman.

          Suddenly he sees her, and immediately stops talking to his

          employees.

          Reverse angle shot of Vivian's back, walking behind the uniformed

          attendant, toward the elevator.

                          LYRICS

           Don't walk away, hey.

          Reverse angle shot on Barney, smiling.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot. Vivian has put the bags she was carrying on the

          table, but has kept her purse, a vey elegant black leather item.

          She opens it, takes some money out of it, and gives the money to

          the uniformed attendant, who helped her carry her shopping bags.

          The attendant smiles.

                          VIVIAN

           Wait... Thank you.

          The attendant walks away. Vivian takes her hat off and falls into

          an armchair.

                          LYRICS

           Oh, oh, pretty woman.

          End of the music.

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY

          The modern building, where Edward's office in L.A. is located. The

          number above the main entrance says 333. We hear male voices

          over. We don't understand everything they are saying.

           MAN (voice over)

           Mister Lewis.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           Gentlemen.

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Edward is standing up with his briefcase, smiling to the men of

          his team around him. He moves to his chair at the meeting table.

          Philip is trying to herd all his assistants out of the room.

                          PHILIP

           Fellas, let's finish this up this afternoon, huh ?

          Edward sits down. A blonde secretary joins the leaving group.

                          PHILIP

           Jake, set something up with Blair. Around two o'clock, two-

           thirty, would be good.

          They all go out, leaving Edward and Philip alone.

                          PHILIP

           You were right about Morse. He mortgaged everything he

           owns, right down to his underwear, to secure a loan from

           the bank.

          He sits down next to Edward.

                          PHILIP

           And it's not just any bank. Plymouth Trust, huh ?

                          EDWARD

           Hmm.

          Edward seems to be very pensive.

                          PHILIP

           So, it goes without saying... that your business means a

           lot more to them than our friend, Mr. Morse. So, all you

           gotta do is call the bank.

          He puts his hands on the telephone.

                          EDWARD

           Yeah.

          Still, a very tepid reaction from Edward. He just takes a small

          glass and puts it in front of him on the table.

          Philip looks at Edward with a worried look. He stands up.

                          PHILIP

           Edward, excuse me for saying this, but what the hell is

           wrong with you this week ? Are you giving Morse a chance to

           get away ?

          Edward has put another glass on top of the first one, and now he

          puts a third one on top of the two other ones.

                          EDWARD

           You know what I used to love when I was a kid, Phil ?

          He puts a fourth glass on top of the other ones. Philip sighs.

                          PHILIP

           What ?

                          EDWARD

           Blocks. Building blocks. Erector sets.

                          PHILIP

           So, I liked Monopoly. Boardwalk, Park Place. Wh-What's the

           point ?

                          EDWARD

           We don't build anything, Phil. We don't make anything.

                          PHILIP

           We make money, Edward. We worked for a year on this deal.

           It's what you said you wanted. I'm handing it to you.

          Edward looks up at Philip.

                          PHILIP

           Morse's jugular is exposed. It's time for the kill. Let's

           finish this. Call the bank !

          He moves the telephone toward Edward. Edward just smiles but

          doesn't pick up the phone.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Close Up on a big Hi-Fi tuner-amplifier. We see Vivian's hand

          setting the power on. Lights appear on the amplifier screen. A

          sign says 102.70 Mhz. We hear some soft easy music. Vivian's

          hand sets the volume a little higher.

          Medium shot on a table, on which everything has been set for a

          dinner for two. Three candlesticks with lighted red candles in

          them are also set on the table. Vivian is seated on one of the

          chair by the table. We see her from the back, but she seems to be

          almost naked, except for what looks like a tie around her neck.

          We hear a door opening, and then closing. Vivian puts her feet up

          on the table. She is wearing black shoes. She puts the end of the

          tie on the table : it is the tie she took from the salesman in the

          store.

          Edward crosses the room, without apparently noticing Vivian.

                          VIVIAN

           How was your day, dear ?

          Edward stops and looks at her.

                          EDWARD

           Nice tie.

                          VIVIAN

           I got it for you.

          PENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Close up shot on the bathtub faucet. We see Vivian's foot reaching

          for the faucet, and the thumb of the foot trying to fit inside the

          faucet.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           Well, my mother was a music teacher... and married my

           father...

          Close Up on Edward naked chest floating in the bathtub. Vivian's

          hand is rubbing a washcloth on the chest.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           ...whose family was extremely wealthy.

          Medium shot on Vivian lying in the tub with Edward lying on top of

          her. Her legs are spread open and her knees comes out of the water

          on either side of Edward's body.

                          EDWARD

           Then he divorced my mother to be with another woman. And he

           took his money with him.

          Vivian puts the washcloth down on the edge of the tub. She takes a

          sponge.

          Close Up shot on Edward's chest. Vivian rubs it with the sponge.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           And then she died. I was very angry with him.

          Medium shot of the tub seen from the foot of the tub.

                          EDWARD

           It cost me ten thousands dollars in therapy to say that

           sentence : I was very angry with him. I do it very well,

           don't I ? I'll say it again. I was very angry with him.

          Vivian laughs, and Edward smiles.

                          EDWARD

           Hello, my name is Mr. Lewis. I'm very angry with my father.

          The camera moves slowly around the bathtub.

                          VIVIAN

           I would've been angry at the ten thousands dollars.

                          EDWARD

           My father was president of the third company I ever took

           over. I bought it. I sold it off piece by piece.

                          VIVIAN

           What'd the shrink say ?

                          EDWARD

           He said I was cured.

          Now the camera has come near the faucet.

          Edward takes Vivian's hand in his.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, so you got even. That must've made you happy.

          Medium shot of Edward and Vivian in the tub.

                          VIVIAN

           Did I mention my leg is 44 inches from hip to toe, so,

           basically, we're talking about 88 inches of therapy...

          She brings her feet up and wraps her legs around Edward's body.

                          VIVIAN

           ...wrapped around you for the bargain price of...

           EDWARD & VIVIAN (together)

           ...three thousands dollars.

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah.

          LOS ANGELES EQUESTRIAN CENTER - EXTERIOR DAY

          Close Up shot on the lawn of the polo field. We hear an air-horn

          blowing, and horses galloping.

          The small polo white ball is in the middle of the shot. We see the

          hooves of several horses approaching the ball. Then a mallet comes

          down and strikes the ball away.

          Medium shot on horse-backed players galloping on the field.

          We hear the announcer on the Public Address.

          Full shot of a lawn used as a parking lot with car parked among

          people sitting in folding chairs and picnicking.

          Philip and his wife Elizabeth are crossing the lawn. Philip is

          carrying a basket and Elisabeth is carrying a large piece of

          printed cloth, to be used as a tablecloth to picnic on it.

                          PHILIP

           Watch where you're walking, because, if you step in

           something, we're not going back in the car.

          Elizabeth is ready to set the cloth at the foot of a tree.

                          PHILIP

           Not too near the tree. I don't like the ants.

          Polo players are galloping in the background. A couple approaches

          Philip and Elizabeth. They all shake hands.

                          PHILIP

           Hello. Have you seen Edward anywhere ?

          Medium shot on Edward and Vivian standing near a car. Edward is

          wearing a very elegant light-grey suit, and Vivian is wearing the

          brown dress with white dots that we've seen her buy on Rodeo

          Drive. She's also wearing a very elegant beige hat with a ribbon

          matching her dress. And Edward is wearing the necktie Vivian gave

          him.

                          VIVIAN

           What if someone recognizes me ?

          Larger shot of the couple.

                          EDWARD

           Not likely. They don't spend too much time on Hollywood

           Boulevard.

                          VIVIAN

           You did.

          He puts his hands around Vivian's waist, to grab her hands behind

          her back.

                          EDWARD

           Come on. Let go. Let go.

          She eventually let him take her hands.

                          EDWARD

           All right. You look great. You look like a lady. You're

           gonna have a wonderful time.

          Medium shot on the couple. She makes a face. He takes her hand and

          drags her behind him

                          EDWARD

           Okay. Don't fidget and smile.

          She makes a broad smile, and walks behind him.

          Close shot on the players on the field.

           ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

           Humboldt's coming around to this side.

          On the edge of the field, two well-dressed gentlemen, a young one

          and and older one, are watching the game.

           ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

           Toquenee is on Kennan. Penalty on that play.

          The two gentlemen walk away from the field. The camera follows

          them around a platform with a canopy above it. On the platform,

          the announcer, a white-haired gentleman, is sitting at a table in

          front of a microphone. On the other side of the platform, the

          camera lets the two gentlemen go on their way and stops on a group

          of four people : Edward, Vivian, Gwen and Gretchen. The two last

          ones are the Olsen sisters, two very elegant blonde women, known

          to be the gossip champions of Los Angeles upper class society.

          Gwen is seated on a chair on the platform, next to the announcer,

          when Gretchen is standing at the foot of the platform.

                          EDWARD

           This is Gwen and Gretchen, the infamous Olsen sisters, who

           have made marrying well an art form.

                          GWEN

           Edward.

                          EDWARD

           Be back in just a second. Hold on.

          He walks away and Vivian remains with the Olsen sisters. In the

          background, a waiter is working on a buffet table.

                          GWEN

           So, you're the flavor of the month. Hmm.

          She turns back to the man seated in front of the microphone.

          Vivian looks a little disturbed by what Gwen just said.

                          GRETCHEN

           Uh, she's just being testy. Edward's our most eligible

           bachelor. Everybody is trying to land him.

          Vivian nods her head and answers Gretchen with a sardonic tone.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, I'm not trying to land him. I'm just using him for

           sex.

          She walks away. Gretchen laughs.

          Medium shot on the edge of the field. A middle-aged couple is

          seated on two chairs and looks at the game. Edward is standing

          behind them. The couple claps their hands and yell to support

          their favorite team. Vivian joins Edward behind the couple. Edward

          claps his hands.

                          EDWARD

           Well done.

          Vivian claps her hands louder than Edward, and then yells with

          wide movements of her hand.

                          VIVIAN

           Well done. Whoo, whoo, whoo !

          Close shot on the couple, who turns around to look at her.

                          VIVIAN

           Tell me again why we're here.

                          EDWARD

           Business.

                          VIVIAN

           Business mingling ?

                          EDWARD

           Yeah.

          We hear an air-horn blowing noisily.

          Close Up on the field. We see the legs of a horse galloping on the

          field.

          Medium shot on a group of spectators under an open tent. Among

          them, Philip, with sunglasses on his nose, and a glass of

          Champagne in his hand. He leaves the group.

                          PHILIP

           Excuse me. Edward !

          Larger shot on another open tent across the lawn from the other

          one. Philip comes in and joins his wife.

                          PHILIP

           Edward. Over here.

          Edward walks in with Vivian. He shakes hands with Philip.

                          EDWARD

           Phil.

                          PHILIP

           Ah, good to see you.

                          EDWARD

           Me too. I want you to meet a new friend of mine, Vivian

           Ward.

                          PHILIP

           Well, hi. Philip Stuckey, Vivian. This is my wife,

           Elizabeth.

          Vivian shakes hands with Philip, then with Elizabeth.

                          ELIZABETH

           It's always a pleasure meeting one of Edward's girls.

          A very elegant blonde lady walks toward them and then away from

          them. Elizabeth turns around to look at her.

                          ELIZABETH

           Oh, my God ! It's Tate Whitley Wallington.

          She runs after Tate.

                          ELIZABETH

           Tate ! It's me, Elizabeth, from Workout World.

          The two men and Vivian watch her go.

                          PHILIP

           Sort of an aerobics queen. Feel the burns. Well, let me get

           you something to drink. Vivian, why don't you start with

           that. Okay ?

          He gives his Champagne glass to Vivian.

                          PHILIP

           I'll be right back. Did you notice Senator Adams is here ?

                          EDWARD

           Mm-hmm. I asked him.

                          PHILIP

           That is why I have pledged my eternal love to you. Mmm !

          He walks away.

                          VIVIAN

           Real genuine guy. Who is he ?

                          EDWARD

           He's my lawyer. He's all right.

                          VIVIAN

           You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.

                          EDWARD

           Maybe we'll try that later.

                          VIVIAN

           Are these people your friends ?

                          EDWARD

           I spend time with them, yeah.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, no wonder.

                          EDWARD

           No wonder what ?

                          VIVIAN

           No wonder why you came looking for me.

           the audience.

          Medium shot on a group of spectators, who are walking under the

          white ribbon which separates the audience from the polo field.

           GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)

           We need you to help replace some of the divots out here on

           the grass.

          Medium shot on guests seated around a table. They all stand up,

          some still carrying their glass of Champagne.

           GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)

           So come on out now.

          Medium full shot on the field. All those very elegant people from

          the upper class society, with their glass of Champagne in hand,

          stomps, with their feet, on the divots on the field.

          place.

          Medium full shot of the announcer's platform. The white-haired

          gentleman is sitting at the table on the platform, with Gwen at

          his side. But he is not talking in the microphone. Another bearded

          man, standing in front of the platform, is talking in a wireless

          microphone. In front of the platform, people are walking under the

          white ribbon to go on the field.

                          BEARDED ANNOUNCER

           This is a time-honored tradition, ladies and gentlemen.

          Medium full shot of Philip, alone in front of a row of empty white

          folding chairs, sneezing and blowing his nose into a white

          handkerchief.

           ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

           As old as the game of polo itself.

          the divots.

          Close shot on Vivian, without her hat, stomping the divots and

          smiling.

          talking to Edward

                          ELIZABETH

           She's sweet, Edward.

          Back on Vivian, stomping the divots.

           ELIZABETH (voice over)

           Wherever did you find her ?

          Back on Edward and Elizabeth.

                          EDWARD

           976-BABE.

          Elizabeth looks a bit surprised by Edward's joke.

          Back on Vivian stomping the divots. Edward joins her.

           ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

           Only one word of advice : Avoid the steaming divot !

          Medium shot of Philip, seated on a chair, and looking at Vivian

          and Edward.

          Back to Vivian and Edward stomping the divots. Vivian laughs very

          loudly, and Edward takes her in his arms.

          Close shot on Philip, who seemed worried by what he sees.

          Medium full shot of Vivian seated on the trunk of a red

          convertible car. Her hat is on the trunk near her. A man takes one

          of Vivian's shoes off to clean it. A woman is standing near the

          car, watching the scene.

                          THE MAN

           No, it's all part of the game of polo. You get to have your

           shoes polished by a member of the club.

          He looks at a dirty spot on the shoe.

                          THE MAN

           I think I got something in the car that will buff that up.

          He walks away with the shoe.

                          VIVIAN

           Thank you.

          Medium shot on David Morse walking toward Vivian. He is wearing

          his polo player outfit : red shirt, with the name of his team

          L.A. Gems and his number in the team 2, and white pants. He is

          holding his helmet, his leather gloves and his riding crops in one

          hand.

                          DAVID MORSE

           Vivian, hi. David Morse.

          Medium shot of Vivian, still seated on the car. She smiles. The

          woman, who was talking with her, walks away.

                          THE WOMAN

           Excuse me.

          Vivian takes her hat, jumps from the car down on the ground, and

          walks toward David.

                          VIVIAN

           David.

                          DAVID MORSE

           How are you ?

                          VIVIAN

           I'm okay.

          David looks at the hat Vivian is holding

                          DAVID MORSE

           I thought that was you. I like this hat.

                          VIVIAN

           It's new.

          Medium shot on Philip watching Vivian talking with David Morse.

          His wife Elizabeth joins him.

           DAVID MORSE (voice over)

           Yeah ?

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           Yeah !

                          ELIZABETH

           What are you looking at ?

                          PHILIP

           Edward's date.

          Reverse angle shot on what Philip sees : David and Vivian talking

          together, seen from a distance. We can't hear what they are

          saying.

           ELIZABETH (voice over)

           I'm going for a ride with the Ritter's in their new car.

           Okay, hon ?

          Back on Philip. Elizabeth gives Philip a kiss on the cheek

                          PHILIP

           Uh-huh.

          Elizabeth understands that Philip has not heard a word of what she

          just said.

                          ELIZABETH

           Philip, I'm going to rip off all my clothes and do a naked

           belly dance for the polo players.

                          PHILIP

           Have fun.

          Elizabeth walks away, looking a bit furious.

          Back on Vivian and David, as watched by Philip. They are now

          standing in front of David's horse, held by a young blonde girl.

                          DAVID MORSE

           Come meet my horse, Vivian.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, Edward's waiting for me. I don't want to...

                          DAVID MORSE

           Come on. He's right here.

                          VIVIAN

           Okay, I'll... Just for a second, though.

          She walks toward the horse, looking back to watch for Edward.

                          VIVIAN

           I didn't know you were playing today.

          Medium shot of Philip and Edward walking between the stands.

                          EDWARD

           Uh... I was asking for directions. There she was.

                          PHILIP

           Oh, so you just ran into her ? That's great, Jesus !

                          PHILIP

           So anyway, what does she do ? Does she... does she work ?

          They stop walking in front of a stand, where waiters are pouring

          Champagne for the guests.

                          EDWARD

           She's in sales.

                          PHILIP

           Sales ? That's terrific. That's good. What does she sell ?

                          EDWARD

           Why do you want to know ?

                          PHILIP

           Now just hear me out on this, okay ? I've known you a long

           time. I... I see some differences in you this week, like

           the tie, and, uh... I'm wondering if maybe this girl isn't

           the difference, especially when I see her talking to David

           Morse.

          Different angle medium shot showing, behind Edward's back, Vivian

          to David in the background. Edward turns around to look at them.

          at Edward, with an inquisitive expression in his eye.

          Closer shot on David and Vivian talking together near the horse,

          still held by the young girl.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           I introduced them at dinner the other night.

           PHILIP (voice over)

           So what ? Now they're best friends ?

          Back on Edward and Philip talking together.

                          PHILIP

           I mean, this girl appears from out of nowhere. Now she's

           talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. That's

           a little convenient, don't you think ?

                          EDWARD

           Don't be ridiculous.

                          PHILIP

           Edward, how... how do you know that this girl... hasn't

           attached herself to you because she's bringing information

           back to Morse ? This happens ! Industrial espionage...

                          EDWARD

           Phil, Phil, Phil ! Phil, listen to me.

                          PHILIP

           What ?

                          EDWARD

           She's not a spy. She is a hooker.

                          PHILIP

           Oh !

                          EDWARD

           She is a hooker. I picked her up on Hollywood Boulevard. In

           your car.

          Philip laughs.

                          PHILIP

           Oh, you are...

                          EDWARD

           Yes, yes.

                          PHILIP

           Oh, man !

          He keeps on laughing louder. He snorts.

                          PHILIP

           You know, you're the only millionaire I ever heard of...

           who goes looking for a bargain basement streetwalker, you

           know ?

           SENATOR ADAMS (voice over)

           Edward !

                          EDWARD

           I'm sorry I told you.

          Edward walks toward Senator Adams, who is calling him. Philip

          keeps on laughing.

                          EDWARD

           Senator. Senator Adams, I'm pleased you could make it.

          Medium shot on the Senator. Edward walks to him and shakes his

          hand.

                          SENATOR ADAMS

           Thank you. I hope the information I gave you was helpful.

          Back on Philip, who walks away with a laughing face.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           Oh, absolutely, yes, and thank you for it.

          Back on Edward with the senator.

                          EDWARD

           There's no change, is there ?

                          SENATOR ADAMS

           No, it's still bogged down.

          Medium shot on Vivian, standing near a tree, with her hat in her

          hand. She is smiling.

          Philip walks behind her. Vivian stops smiling.

                          PHILIP

           Having a nice time, Vivian ?

          She smiles again.

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah, I'm having a great time.

                          PHILIP

           Must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard, hmm ?

          She stops smiling and shows a very sad and worried face.

                          VIVIAN

           What ?

                          PHILIP

           Yeah, Edward told me. But don't worry : you're secret is

           safe with me. Listen, maybe, uh, you and I could get

           together sometime...

          He touches her bare arm with his sunglasses.

                          PHILIP

           ...after Edward leaves.

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah, sure. Why not ?

          We sense that Vivian feels like crying, but she masters her

          emotions and looks at Philip.

                          PHILIP

           We'll just have to do that, hmm ?

          He puts the tip of his fingers on her bare shoulder.

           ELIZABETH (voice over)

           Philip !

          Philip turns around to look at his wife. Then he walks away.

          Vivian remains on the same spot, with a very sad face.

           GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)

           Hi, tailgaters. I'd like to mention a couple of our silver

           sponsors...

          Close shot on Edward looking at Vivian. He smiles.

           GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)

           ...Jacobs Distributors, Norrell Saddlery, and we'd like to

           give a great big thanks to our platinum sponsor...

          Back to Vivian. She doesn't look at Edward and keeps the same

          sullen sad face.

           GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)

           Edward Lewis Enterprises.

          Applause and air horn blowing.

          Vivian crosses her arms, but doesn't look at Edward.

           ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)

           The ball is in for chukker number four.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING

          Medium shot on the main door. It opens and Edward comes in,

          followed by Vivian.

          Vivian closes the door, and Edward looks at his mail lying on a

          small table. Vivian throws her hat and gloves on another table

          with a nervous movement. Edward turns around to look at her.

                          EDWARD

           You all right ?

                          VIVIAN

           I'm fine.

          She walks away.

                          EDWARD

           Fine. That's good. Seven fines since we left the match.

          Edward picks up his mail and newspaper, and walks behind her.

                          EDWARD

           Could I have another word, please ?

          The camera follows Edward in the room. In the background, across

          the open door of the bedroom, we see Vivian entering the bathroom.

                          VIVIAN

           Asshole ! There's a word.

          She slams the bathroom door.

                          EDWARD

           I think I liked fine better.

          Edward drops his mail and newspapers on the desk.

          Vivian opens the bathroom door, and stands near the open door.

                          VIVIAN

           You know what ? Just tell me one thing : Why did you make

           me get all dressed up ?

          Edward walks toward her. The camera follows him.

                          EDWARD

           Well, for one thing, the clothing was appropriate.

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR EVENING

          Edward takes his jacket off.

                          VIVIAN

           No, what I mean is, if you were gonna tell everybody I'm a

           hooker, - why didn't you just let me wear my own clothes,

           okay ?

          Edward sits down on the bed.

                          EDWARD

           I did not... I did not...

                          VIVIAN

           I mean, in my own clothes, when someone like that guy

           Stuckey comes up to me, I can handle it, I'm prepared.

          Edward starts unlacing his shoes. Vivian walks away toward the

          living room. The camera follows her.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING

          Vivian is trying unsuccessfully to open a bottle of Coca-Cola. In

          the background, Edward is still sitting on the bed, taking his

          shoes off.

                          EDWARD

           I'm very sorry. I'm not happy with Stuckey at all for

           saying or doing that. But he is my attorney. I've known him

           for ten years.

          Edward stands up and walks toward Vivian.

                          EDWARD

           He thought you were some kind of an industrial spy. The

           guy's paranoid.

                          VIVIAN

           What are you, my pimp now ?

          She puts the unopened bottle back on the table.

                          VIVIAN

           You know, you think you can pass me around to your

           friends ? I'm not some little toy !

          She walks away toward the bedroom.

                          EDWARD

           Look, you're not my toy, I know you're not my toy.

          He walks behind her.

                          EDWARD

           Vivian ! Vivian, I'm speaking to you. Come back here !

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR EVENING

          Vivian was ready to enter the bathroom, but she turns around.

                          EDWARD

           I hate to point out the obvious, but you are, in fact, a

           hooker ! And you are my employee !

                          VIVIAN

           Look, you don't own me. I decide, okay ? I say who. I say

           when. I... I say who...

                          EDWARD

           I refuse to spend the next three days fighting with you. I

           said I was sorry. I meant it. That's the end of it !

                          VIVIAN

           I'm sorry I ever met you.

          She walks away into the bathroom

                          VIVIAN

           I'm sorry I ever got into your stupid car !

          He walks toward the bathroom, enters it and starts taking his tie

          off in front of the mirror.

                          EDWARD

           As if you had so many more appealing options.

          Vivian comes back to the bathroom door, carrying a bunch of

          clothes.

                          VIVIAN

           I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did

           today.

                          EDWARD

           Somehow, I find that very hard to believe.

          She gets out of the bathroom with her arms full of clothes. She

          picks up a small handbag and puts it on her shoulder. Then she

          tries to pick up a larger handbag.

          Close shot on the handbag, stuck under an armchair. We notice that

          Vivian is bare feet.

          Vivian finally succeeds in picking up the bag and put the straps

          over her shoulder, on top of the smaller bag. Edward walks out of

          the bathroom and joins her.

                          EDWARD

           Where are you going ?

                          VIVIAN

           I want my money. I want to get out of here.

          She crosses her arms on her bunch of clothes. She has a very

          sullen, sad face. Edward doesn't move for a couple of seconds,

          then walks to the bed, to pick up his jacket. He gets his wallet

          from the inside pocket of his jacket. He opens the wallet, and

          gets a large wad of banknotes out of it.

          Close up shot on the bed. We see the wad of banknotes falling on

          the bed. They are all hundred-dollar bills.

          Edward walks away toward the living room, and Vivian remains

          without moving with her sullen sad face. She looks down at the

          bed.

          Close up shot on the wad of banknotes on the bed.

          Back to Vivian, who hasn't moved. She starts walking away toward

          the living room, without taking her money.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING

          Edward is standing near the desk, looking at his mail. Vivian

          walks behind him, coming from the bedroom and going away toward

          the front door. We hear the door opening. Edward looks up toward

          the door. The door closes, and Edward looks very pensive. He looks

          back into the bedroom.

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR EVENING

          Close up on the bed, where the wad of banknotes is still lying.

          Medium shot on Vivian, standing near the elevator, and nervously

          pressing on the elevator call button.

                          VIVIAN

           Come on !

          Medium close shot on Vivian. We hear the penthouse door opening,

          but Vivian doesn't look at it and keeps looking at the elevator in

          front of her.

          Larger shot. Edward is coming out of the penthouse, and he has

          left the door open. He walks toward Vivian.

                          EDWARD

           I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared to answer questions about us.

           It was stupid and cruel. I didn't mean it. I don't want you

           to go. Will you stay the week ?

                          VIVIAN

           Why ?

                          EDWARD

           I saw you talking to David Morse. I didn't like it.

                          VIVIAN

           We were just talking.

          He chuckles.

                          EDWARD

           I didn't like it.

          The elevator bell dings. The elevator door opens, and a smiling

          Dennis appears.

                          DENNIS

           Down ?

          Close shot on Edward's face, and then on Vivian's face.

          Dennis feels some tension between Edward and Vivian and stops

          smiling. He goes back into the elevator, presses a button and the

          door closes.

                          VIVIAN

           You hurt me.

                          EDWARD

           Yes.

                          VIVIAN

           Don't do it again.

          They look at each other for a couple of seconds, then slowly,

          Vivian walks back to the penthouse. Edward follows her and takes

          one of her handbags from her shoulder. They both enters the

          penthouse and he closes the door behind him.

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          High angle shot above the bed. Edward and Vivian are lying in the

          bed, presumably naked, but covered by a sheet from their waist

          down. They are facing each other and talking.

                          VIVIAN

           First guy I ever loved was a total nothing. Second was

           worse. My mom called me a bum magnet. If there was a bum

           within a fifty-mile radius, I was completely attracted to

           him. That's how I ended up here. I followed bum number

           three.

          Slowly, the camera moves closer to them.

                          EDWARD

           Mm.

                          VIVIAN

           So here I was : no money, no friends, no bum.

                          EDWARD

           So then you chose this as your profession ?

                          VIVIAN

           I worked at a couple fast food places, parked cars at

           wrestling. And I couldn't make the rent. I was too ashamed

           to go home. That's when I met Kit. She was a hooker and

           made it sound so great. So one day I did it.

          The camera stops moving forward, having reached a medium close

          shot, showing Vivian and Edward's heads and shoulders.

                          VIVIAN

           I cried the whole time. But then I got some regulars and,

           you know... It's not like anybody plans this. It's not your

           childhood dream.

                          EDWARD

           You could be so much more.

          Close shot on Vivian's face.

                          VIVIAN

           People put you down enough, you start to believe it.

          Reverse shot on Edward's face.

                          EDWARD

           I think you are a very bright, very special woman.

          Reverse shot on Vivian's face.

                          VIVIAN

           The bad stuff is easier to believe. You ever notice that ?

          Medium full shot on Philip, standing in front of the desk, and

          talking to the receptionist girl.

                          PHILIP

           No, I don't want to talk to him now. Tell him I'll call him

           on Monday.

          He walks away from the desk.

                          THE RECEPTIONIST

           Yes, sir.

          A blonde female secretary walks into the room, carrying a thick

          pile of documents.

                          PHILIP

           Where are you going ? Did he sign these ?

                          THE SECRETARY

           No, he said he had to leave.

          Philip walks nervously across the room.

                          PHILIP

           He had to...

          He meets Edward coming out of an office.

                          PHILIP

           Edward, you can't disappear now. We're in this too deep.

                          EDWARD

           Don't panic, Philip. Morse isn't going anywhere. I'll be

           back here in the morning.

          He stops at the reception desk.

                          EDWARD

           Did you send the tickets to the hotel ?

                          THE RECEPTIONIST

           Yes, sir.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you.

          He starts walking out of the room.

                          PHILIP

           Where are you going ?

                          EDWARD

           I have a date.

                          PHILIP

           With the hooker ?

          Edward stops walking. He doesn't seem very happy by what Philip

          just said. He slowly turns around, facing Philip.

                          EDWARD

           Be careful, Philip.

          He walks away. Philip slowly turns around and walks into his

          office.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING

          Medium shot of Edward standing in front of the closed bedroom

          door. He is very elegantly dressed in black tuxedo and bow-tie.

          When he hears the bedroom door opening, he crosses his arm and

          leans on the bar.

          The door opens and Vivian appears. She is very elegantly dressed

          in a long red evening dress. She is also wearing long white

          gloves. She walks into the room. She stops in front of Edward and

          faces him. Edward moves around her.

                          VIVIAN

           Do I look okay ?

                          EDWARD

           Mmm.

                          VIVIAN

           Mmm ?

                          EDWARD

           Something's missing.

          She looks at herself and at her tight-fitting dress.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, nothing else is gonna fit into this dress. I'll tell

           you that.

          Edward picks up a mauve-colored box on the bar.

                          EDWARD

           Well, maybe something in this box. I don't want you to get

           too excited. This is only on loan.

          He opens the box : it's a jewel box. Vivian comes closer to the

          box and looks into it. What she sees looks like a very beautiful

          and expensive necklace. She moves her hand to touch delicately the

          necklace, but Edward snaps the lid of the box shut, almost

          squeezing her finger into it.

                          VIVIAN

           Oh !

          She bursts out laughing loudly. Edward opens the box again.

          Close shot in front of a mirror. Edward is fixing the necklace

          around Vivian's neck.

                          VIVIAN

           They really let you borrow this from the jewelry store ?

                          EDWARD

           I'm a very good customer.

                          VIVIAN

           If you were gonna buy this, how much would it cost ?

                          EDWARD

           Quarter of a million.

          Vivian laughs nervously.

                          VIVIAN

           A quarter of a million dollars ?

          Edward turns around Vivian, and his black-colored back blocks

          completely our view of the scene, making some sort of fade-out /

          fade-in with the next scene.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR EVENING

          Edward's back is still blocking completely our view of the scene.

          But then Edward moves to stand beside Vivian in the back of the

          cabin of the elevator. She is carrying a small golden purse.

                          VIVIAN

           So, where are we going ?

                          EDWARD

           It's a surprise.

                          VIVIAN

           If I forget to tell you later, I had a really good time

           tonight.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you.

          We hear the beginning of the orchestral music of Fallen, written

          and performed by Lauren Wood.

          Vivian and Edward are getting out of the elevator and they start

          crossing the lobby. Dennis comes out of the elevator to have a

          better look.

          Medium full shot on a desk. Two uniformed attendant are standing

          near the desk. Another man, wearing a suit, is standing behind the

          desk, and checking things in an open ledger. All three of them

          look at the passing couple.

          Vivian and Edward keep on walking across the lobby. He looks at

          her. She touches her necklace.

          Medium shot on the reception desk. Miss Wilson and another female

          receptionist are standing behind the desk, talking with a guest.

          They look at the couple and smile.

          Barney is standing near a wall tapestry, talking to a guest. He

          looks at the couple and seems very happy by what he sees.

          Back on Vivian and Edward crossing the lobby.

                          EDWARD

           When you're not fidgeting, you look very beautiful... and

           very tall.

          Vivian laughs.

           you ?

          Darryl closes the back door, and stands near the car.

           And I want to tell you...

          Edward walks, on the red carpet, toward the plane, followed by

          Vivian. They talk together, but the lyrics of the song cover their

          voices.

                          LYRICS

           ...you control my brain.

          Long shot on the runway, with the corporate jet plane taking off.

          The camera follows the plane.

                          LYRICS

           And you should know that...

          ABOVE LOS ANGELES - EXTERIOR EVENING

          The jet plane is flying above L.A., with the sun setting down in

          the background.

                          LYRICS

           ...you are life in my veins.

           PILOT (voice over)

           Well, it should be a pretty smooth flight, Mr. Lewis. The

           weather is clear all the way up to San Francisco. We should

           be there in about fifty minutes.

          SAN FRANCISCO - AERIAL VIEW - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Extreme long aerial shot of San Francisco.

          SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium long shot of the main entrance of the opera house, with the

          cars coming and going and dropping the spectators.

          End of the music.

          SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Full shot on the lobby, which is almost empty. Apparently, Edward

          and Vivian are among the last spectators. Vivian, who seems a bit

          nervous, is holding Edward's arm very tightly.

                          VIVIAN

           We're late.

                          EDWARD

           No, it's all right. Opening night never starts on time.

                          VIVIAN

           Okay.

          They walk near a stand, where a girl, wearing black tuxedo and

          bow-tie, is distributing programs. Edward takes a program.

           THE PROGRAM ATTENDANT

           Program, sir.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you.

          SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - BOX - INTERIOR NIGHT

          The camera pans, from right to left, a succession of private boxes

          in the medium upper level of the theatre. All the men are wearing

          black tuxedoes and bow-ties, and all the women are wearing very

          elegant and very expensive evening dresses.

          We hear the instruments of the orchestra warming up.

          The third box is empty, but an usher shows Edward and Vivian

          through the door of the box.

                          USHER

           Right this way, Mr. Lewis, sir.

          Vivian enters first, followed by Edward. Vivian looks down from

          the balustrade of the box. Edward shakes hand with Doris, an old

          lady in the next box.

                          EDWARD

           Doris.

                          DORIS

           Edward, how are you ?

                          EDWARD

           How nice to see you. Nice to see you.

          The camera starts going away and down from the box.

                          EDWARD

           Sir.

          He shakes hands with Doris' husband.

                          DORIS' HUSBAND

           Good evening, Edward.

                          EDWARD

           Wonderful news. Congratulations.

          Meanwhile, Vivian has moved to the corner of the balustrade.

                          VIVIAN

           Hey, come here. You gotta look at this.

          Medium close shot on the box. Edward, who, as we already know it,

          is afraid of heights, doesn't want to move any closer to the

          balustrade.

                          EDWARD

           It's all right. I've already seen it.

                          VIVIAN

           If you're afraid of heights, why do you get seats up here ?

                          EDWARD

           Because they're the best.

          He sits down, and Vivian also sits down. The ushers, who had

          remained behind them, slightly bends down toward Edward.

                          USHER

           Is there anything else, sir ?

                          EDWARD

           No, thank you.

          He shows them something underneath the balustrade, and then moves

          away.

                          USHER

           The glasses are there. Enjoy the opera.

                          VIVIAN

           Oh !

          She picks up the opera glasses.

                          VIVIAN

           So, you said this is in Italian.

          She tries to look through the glasses, but doesn't succeed in

          setting them right on their handle.

                          EDWARD

           Mm-hmmm.

                          VIVIAN

           So how am I gonna know what they're singing. These are

           broken.

          Edward takes the glasses from Vivian's hand.

                          VIVIAN

           Mine are broken.

                          EDWARD

           No, no. That's okay It's all right.

          He sets them right on their handle, and gives them back to Vivian.

                          VIVIAN

           Oh.

                          EDWARD

           You'll know. Believe me, you'll understand.

          Vivian looks through the glasses, while the lights are switching

          off and on, to warn the spectators that the opera is about to

          begin.

                          EDWARD

           The music's very powerful.

          Mediums full shot on the two next boxes on the right of Edward's

          box. The spectators, who understood the lights signal, are sitting

          down.

          Back to Edward's box. Medium close shot on Vivian and Edward.

          Vivian is looking through her glasses.

                          VIVIAN

           There's a band !

          Medium shot on the two other boxes. The light are definitely

          switched off, and ushers are closing the curtains on the exit

          doors.

          Back to Vivian and Edward. We hardly see them in the dark.

                          EDWARD

           People's reactions to opera the first time they see it is

           very dramatic. They either love it or they hate it. If they

           love it, they will always love it. If they don't, they may

           learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of

           their soul.

                          VIVIAN

           Mmm.

          The orchestra plays the overture of La Traviata.

          The lights, coming from the stage, enable us to see Vivian and

          Edward's faces. Vivian is smiling broadly. Edward is concentrated

          on the music and serious.

          Close shot on Vivian's face. Still smiling broadly, she turns

          briefly toward Edward, and then goes back looking at the stage.

          She bends down on the balustrade to have a better look at the

          stage.

          SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - STAGE - INTERIOR NIGHT

          The sets and the costumes are beautiful and very classic in their

          design. We see and hear the Love Duet of Act One in Violetta's

          sitting room.

          Violetta walks to the forefront of the stage, and the camera moves

          away from her, showing, seen from the stage, Edward and Vivian in

          their box.

          The picture and the music dissolve to the Second Act in Violetta's

          garden. Violetta is bending on Alfredo and singing.

          SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - BOX - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Low angle shot of the box. Vivian turns toward Edward, and then

          look back at the stage. Edward looks at her.

          SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - STAGE - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium close shot on Violetta and Alfredo, in each other's arms.

          Violetta keeps on singing.

          SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - BOX - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Closer low angle shot on Edward an Vivian. The camera tilts up

          toward their faces.

          SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - STAGE - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Violetta kisses Alfredo on the mouth, and then walks away.

          The music dissolves on the Final Scene of the Third Act, and the

          picture dissolves on :

          SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - BOX - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium close shot of Vivian and Edward. The camera moves closer to

          Vivian's face : she is crying.

          Close shot on Edward's face : he looks at Vivian.

          Back on Vivian's face, crying.

          Back on Edward's face.

          Medium close shot on their both faces, seen in profile from their

          right.

          Last orchestral notes and applauses.

           VARIOUS SPECTATORS (voices over)

           Bravo ! Bravo ! Bravo ! Bravo ! Bravo !

          Medium shot on Doris' box. Doris and her female friend are

          applauding, sitting in front of the balustrade. The two husbands

          are standing up behind them and also applauding.

          Back to Edward's box. Close shot of Vivian standing up. She still

          has tears in her eyes. She walks away from her seat, coming near

          Doris' box.

                          DORIS

           Did you enjoy the opera, dear ?

                          VIVIAN

           Oh, it was so good, I almost peed in my pants.

                          DORIS

           What ?

          She seems a bit surprised by what she just heard. Vivian walks

          away, and Edward turns toward Doris.

                          EDWARD

           She said she liked it better than Pirates of Penzance.

                          DORIS

           Oh !

          Edward walks away, leaving a very pensive Doris. Apparently she

          doesn't completely believe Edward's translation of Vivian's

          words !

                          EDWARD

           Yes. Good-bye now.

          Still very pensive, Doris absently waves her hand to him.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Long shot from across the street. We see the limousine parking in

          front of the hotel.

          Medium long shot on the limousine parking. We hear Edward and

          Vivian's conversation in voices over.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           No, don't touch..

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           I moved the queen. I like the queen.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           You can't move the queen.

          Vivian laughs, still in voice over.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Vivian and Edward are seated on either side of a round table,

          playing chess. The room is very dimly lit, and there are two lit

          candles on the table. They are still wearing their opera clothes,

          but Edward has taken his jacket off.

          Slowly, the camera moves forward from an medium full shot of the

          table and the two characters on either side of it, to a close shot

          on the chess board.

                          EDWARD (LAUGHING)

           Did you really do that ? Why don't we finish this

           tomorrow ? It's really late, and I have to work.

                          VIVIAN

           Why don't you not go to work tomorrow. Take the day off.

                          EDWARD

           Me, not work ?

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah.

                          EDWARD

           I do own the company.

          The picture dissolves into :

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY

          Aerial shot of Edward's office building. Actually there are two

          twins towers.

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - PHILIP'S ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          High angle shot on Philip's desk. Various documents are spread on

          the desk. But set above these documents, there is a miniature

          billiard table. And Philip is practicing his billiard with a

          miniature billiard cue. He makes a shot and then looks at a

          printed document lying next to the miniature table. He then moves

          a ball on the billiard table.

          A female secretary comes into view on the left of the screen. She

          is handing some documents to Philip.

                          SECRETARY

           Here are the storage reports you wanted, and Mr. Lewis

           called.

          Philip doesn't take the documents and she puts them on the desk.

                          PHILIP

           What'd he say ?

                          SECRETARY

           He said he's taking the day off.

          Philip looks very surprised.

                          PHILIP

           He's taking the day off ?

                          SECRETARY

           That's what he said.

          She walks away, leaving a very perplexed Philip.

          LOS ANGELES - A PUBLIC PARK - EXTERIOR DAY

          A beautiful public park in L.A.

          A huge fountain with water works pouring gallons of water into the

          pool.

          Full shot of Edward and Vivian walking along the fountain, Vivian

          walking on a low wall, and Edward walking in the lane. Vivian is

          wearing a white dress with thin vertical stripes, and carrying a

          little black purse. Edward is wearing a very elegant grey suit,

          and he is carrying his leather briefcase.

                          VIVIAN

           I'm starving. There's a snap dog vendor over there. Do you

           have any money ?

          She jumps down from the low wall and takes Edward's arm.

                          EDWARD

           I have money. I don't know what a snap dog is, but I have

           money.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, I'm gonna give, um... you'll buy a snap dog. We'll

           cop a squat under a tree somewhere.

                          EDWARD

           Cop a what ?

                          VIVIAN

           Cop a squat.

          Later on a lawn in the park.

          Medium close shot on a tartan red blanket spread on the lawn.

          Vivian is kneeling on the blanket, with Edward seated next to her.

          She has already taken one of Edward's shoes and socks off, and she

          is taking the other sock off. Edward is talking on his cellphone.

                          EDWARD

           All right, read the first two pages.

          Medium full shot of the lawn. We see that Vivian and Edward are

          sitting under a tree. Vivian takes the other sock off.

                          EDWARD

           Okay... Mmm...

          Vivian stands up, and takes Edward's cellphone away from his ear,

          and shuts it.

                          EDWARD

           I was talking to someone.

          The picture dissolves into :

          LIMOUSINE - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Edward and Vivian are seated next to each other inside the

          limousine. Edward is wearing a suit and a tie, and Vivian is

          wearing a purple dress.

                          EDWARD

           Did you know that two of the Bach pieces that we heard

           tonight... were found by Felix Mendelssohn in a butcher's

           shop ? They were wrapping meat with the sheet music.

          Vivian is not listening to Edward and she keeps looking through

          the car window. She seems nervous.

                          EDWARD

           What's with you ? You're fidgeting. What's wrong ?

                          VIVIAN

           Um... There's a club up here that I'd like to stop into for

           a second to see my roommate, if that's okay ?

                          EDWARD

           Absolutely.

          He raises his voice.

                          EDWARD

           Darryl !

                          VIVIAN

           please ?

          Full shot of the boulevard.

          The limousine slows down in front of The Blue Banana. There are

           The Blue Banana ?

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           The Blue Banana.

           Very colorful life you lead.

           You say this is a nice place. I'm sure it's a very nice

           place.

          He closes the door of the car.

                          VIVIAN

           I just wanna run in for a minute and see if she's there, so

           just stay here.

          A quick shot on people exchanging things, maybe drugs.

          Back to the limousine.

                          VIVIAN

           I'm hoping they don't spot this limousine as it is.

                          EDWARD

           I'll block it with my body.

          He leans on the limousine.

          Vivian walks away toward the entrance of the night club.

          THE BLUE BANANA CLUB - MAIN ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          We hear the song Fame 90, performed by David Bowie.

          Medium shot on a metal staircase, with a young man and a young

          woman standing at the bottom of the staircase.

          Medium shot of a couple dancing in front of the fresco. The whole

          club is bathed in red light. The camera starts panning to the

          left, showing more people dancing.

           loose and hard to swallow.

          Vivian enters the room, looking for Kit.

                          LYRICS

           Fame puts you there where things are hollow.

          Customers start looking at Vivian, and at her elegant dress.

                          A CUSTOMER

           Hey, Viv, you looking good, man. What'd you win, the

           lottery or what ?

          Vivian walks toward Rachel, one of the dancing girls.

                          VIVIAN

           Hey, Rachel, have you seen Kit ?

                          RACHEL

           No, not since, uh, Tuesday. Hey, and Carlos is looking for

           her too.

           A CUSTOMER (voice over)

           Hiya, honey, you look great.

          Vivian walks toward the bar and Pops, the bartender, standing

          behind it.

                          VIVIAN

           Hi, Pops. Thanks. Have you seen Kit ?

                          POPS

           I think she went to Santa Barbara.

          End of music.

          Medium full shot on the entrance of the club. Edward is standing

          facing the door. A group of tough-looking guys come behind him on

          rollers and skate-board. Edward turns around to face them.

                          EDWARD

           Hi.

          We hear the muffled sound of the music, coming from the club.

          THE BLUE BANANA CLUB - MAIN ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          We hear the music loud again.

          Medium shot of Vivian, still standing near the bar and facing

          Pops. She is writing something on a piece of paper.

                          VIVIAN

           Here's my number where I'm gonna be for the rest of the

           week. Have her call me or come by, okay ?

                          POPS

           Okay, honey. Thanks.

                          VIVIAN

           Thanks.

          She walks away from the bar.

          BACK ALLEYWAY - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Muffled sound of the music coming from inside the night club.

                          LYRICS

           Fame, what you like is in the limo. Fame.

          Mediums shot of Vivian coming out of the club. On the door, a sign

          says I.D. Required. Vivian stops when she sees the strange crowd

          around Edward, then she starts walking again. She stops when she

          gets near Edward. Among the tough-looking guys around Edward, we

          recognize Carlos, still wearing his eternal hat, and another guy,

          one of Carlos' lieutenants, wearing a leather jacket, and holding

          a long stick in his hands.

                          VIVIAN

           What's going on out here ?

                          EDWARD

           I don't know. You left and all of a sudden I'm in the

           middle of West Side Story.

                          CARLOS

           I think you owe me some money, baby.

           THE GUY WITH THE STICK

           Two hundred dollars.

                          EDWARD

           Why don't you go to school tomorrow ?

          A girl, standing behind the group, starts giggling very stupidly.

                          CARLOS

           Now I hear you got yourself a new job ?

                          VIVIAN

           Let's just leave.

          She starts walking away, but Carlos puts himself in her way.

                          CARLOS

           You ain't going no place.

          Edward takes a step forward.

                          EDWARD

           Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

          The guy, standing next to Carlos, takes a very long knife out of

          his skateboard.

                          CARLOS

           You're out of your neighborhood, home boy. This ain't no

           Beverly Hills !

                          EDWARD

           I don't believe this. He has this knife coming out of his

           skateboard. He's going to stab me.

          He turns toward the guy with the stick.

                          EDWARD

           What are you gonna do, you gonna strangle me with a

           Slinky ?

          The stupid girl giggles again. Carlos turns toward her.

                          CARLOS

           Shut up !

                          EDWARD

           All right, okay, this is what's happening. You believe that

           this person owes you money, right, two hundred dollars ?

                          CARLOS

           That's right.

                          EDWARD

           Why ?

                          CARLOS

           Because this is my block.

          Edward turns toward Vivian.

                          EDWARD

           His block ?

                          VIVIAN

           He's a drug dealer. It has to do with Kit. Let's just go,

           Edward.

          She starts walking away. But Carlos is in their way.

                          CARLOS

           Edward. So how's it feel to be a trick ?

                          EDWARD

           I am not a trick. This is a trick.

          He points his hand toward Darry.

                          EDWARD

           Darryl ! Left pocket.

          Medium close shot on Darryl, standing near the limousine. He opens

          his jacket, revealing a holster with a gun inside.

          Back to the group around Vivian and Edward.

                          EDWARD

           Isn't that incredible ? And he does have a permit. Thank

           you, gentlemen.

          He pushes Vivian in front of him and crosses the group. He stops a

          couple of seconds near Carlos.

                          EDWARD

           Don't you ever go near her again.

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           Does Darryl always carry a gun ?

           EDWARD (voice over)

           When he drives me, yes, always.

          The picture dissolves into :

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Through the open door of the bathroom, we see Vivian getting ready

          for the night. She is wearing a sleeveless nightdress. She

          releases her hair, which were tied in a bun, and walks out of the

          bathroom. She stops and looks at the bed.

                          VIVIAN

           He sleeps.

          Reverse close shot on Edward asleep half-sitting in the bed. He is

          bare-chested. Vivian walks between him and the camera. She sits

          down on the bed.

          Reverse close shot on Vivian's face. She is smiling. She gently

          kisses her index finger.

          Medium shot of Vivian and Edward. Vivian puts her finger on

          Edward's lips. She slowly bends down toward his face, and kisses

          him on the cheek, hesitates a second, then kisses him on the lips.

          He slowly wakes up, and blinks his eyes. He answers to Vivian's

          kisses. He raises up from the bed, kissing Vivian passionately.

          The camera moves around the bed, while the couple is lying on it,

          kissing passionately.

          Vivian removes her nightdress, and goes back kissing Edward.

          Later.

          The camera tilts down from the head of the bed.

          Edward is asleep, holding Vivian is his arm. She is still awake

          and smiling. She gently strokes his arm.

                          VIVIAN

           I love you.

          She closes her eyes.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot on Edward seated at the breakfast table.

          Edward is fully dressed, but without his jacket. He is eating

          breakfast.

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           What are you thinking about sitting here all by yourself ?

          Full shot on the breakfast table. Vivian is wearing a black

          nightgown with flowers printed on it. She is looking at the

          newspaper.

                          EDWARD

           The fact that this will be our last night together, and

           you'll finally be rid of me.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, you've been pretty tough to take.

          She sits down on a chair.

                          EDWARD

           My business is almost over, so I'll be going back to New

           York.

          Quick close shot on Vivian's face, who seems very pensive.

          Back to Edward.

                          EDWARD

           I'd really like to see you again.

          Vivian smiles.

                          VIVIAN

           You would ?

                          EDWARD

           Yes. Yes, I would, so I've arranged for you to have an

           apartment, to have a car...

          Vivian's smiling face saddens a bit.

                          EDWARD

           ...to have a wide variety of stores guaranteed to suck up

           to you anytime you want to go shopping. Everything's done.

          Vivian takes her head in her hand and bends down on the table. She

          exhales.

                          VIVIAN

           What else ? You gonna leave some money by the bed when you

           pass through town ?

                          EDWARD

           Vivian, it really wouldn't be like that.

                          VIVIAN

           How would it be ?

                          EDWARD

           Well, for one thing, it would get you off the streets.

                          VIVIAN

           That's just geography.

          Vivian stands up and walks to the terrace.

          PENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Medium full shot of Vivian walking out of the penthouse on the

          terrace. In the background, we see Edward still seated at the

          breakfast table. Vivian bends on the balustrade. Edward stands up,

          and walks toward Vivian.

          Slight low angle shot taken from outside the terrace, showing

          Vivian bending on the balustrade.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           Vivian, what is it you want ?

          Medium close shot on Edward standing by the terrace door.

                          EDWARD

           What do you see happening between us ?

          Back to Vivian bending over the balustrade.

                          VIVIAN

           I don't know. When I was a little girl, my mama used to

           lock me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty

           often. And I would... I would pretend I was a princess...

           trapped in a tower by a wicked queen.

          Edward is seriously listening to Vivian.

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           And then suddenly this knight...

          Back to Vivian bending over the balustrade.

                          VIVIAN

           ...on a white horse with these colors flying would come

           charging up and draw his sword. And I would wave. And he

           would climb up the tower and rescue me.

          She walks away from the balustrade and toward Edward.

                          VIVIAN

           But never in all the time... that I had this dream did the

           knight say to me, Come on, baby, I'll put you up in a

           great condo.

          The phone rings inside the penthouse. After a couple of seconds,

          Edward walks into the penthouse, and picks up the phone.

                          EDWARD

           Yes.

          Vivian starts walking into the room.

           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

           I had to call.

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of Philip, wearing a dark-colored bathrobe, and

          standing near the sink in his bathroom. On the counter next to the

          sink, a lot of bottles and jars : perfumes and cosmetics. Philip

          is calling from a wireless telephone.

                          PHILIP

           I just got off the phone with James Morse. Get this.

          PENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Back to the same scene, with Vivian standing near the terrace

          door, and looking a bit sad, and, in the background, in the

          living-room, Edward on the telephone.

           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

           He wants to meet with you today.

                          EDWARD

           What about ?

           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

           He wouldn't say.

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Philip, the phone receiver stuck between his shoulder and his

          head, is drying his hands on a white towel.

                          PHILIP

           Edward, I think we got him. His nuts are on the block. We

           got him !

          He slams his towel on the counter.

          PENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Same shot. We hear Philip's laugh on the phone.

           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)

           Look, if he's really caving in, I want to get him to commit

           his stocks to us this afternoon. Hmm ?

                          EDWARD

           No, it's no good. If he's really caving in, I don't want to

           wait until this afternoon. Have Morse meet me downtown this

           morning. Good-bye.

          He puts the phone down and grabs his jacket from a chair. He puts

          his jacket on while walking toward Vivian.

                          EDWARD

           I have to go now, but I want you to understand... I heard

           everything you said. This is all I'm capable of right now.

           It's a very big step for me.

          She absently straightened his tie.

                          VIVIAN

           I know. It's a really good offer for a girl like me.

                          EDWARD

           I've never treated you like a prostitute.

          He looks at her, then walks away toward the front door. Out of his

          hearing, Vivian whispers :

                          VIVIAN

           You just did.

          We hear the front door closing.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot on the front desk. Miss Wilson, the receptionist, is

          standing behind the counter. She doesn't wear her large glasses,

          but she looks a bit worried.

          The camera slowly pans across the counter, and we discover Barney,

          the manager, talking on the phone.

                          BARNEY

           It's Barnard Thompson here, Miss Vivian.

          The camera keeps on panning and we discover Kit, chewing gum, and

          looking in a bad mood. On the top half of her body, she is only

          wearing a bra made into a fabric with a panther-skin motif

                          BARNEY

           Could you come down to the front desk ? There's someone

           here who wants to speak to you. She says her name is Miss

           De Luca...

          Kit extends her hand to take the phone.

                          KIT

           Let me talk to her. Let me... Let me just talk to her.

          Barney gives the phone to Kit.

                          KIT

           Yo, Viv, babe. Would you come down here ? The sphincter

           police won't let me through. Okay.

          She gives the phone back to Barney.

                          KIT

           She's on her way.

                          BARNEY

           Fine.

          An uniformed attendant walks to the counter.

                          THE ATTENDANT

           Mr. Thompson.

          Barney turns toward him and Kit replaces the phone receiver on its

          hook.

                          BARNEY

           Yes.

                          THE ATTENDANT

           The window washer is refusing to come down.

          The attendant walks away.

                          BARNEY

           It's a Saturday. Wait here, please.

           (to Miss Wilson)

           Watch her.

          Barney walks away.

           MISS WILSON (voice over)

           Yes, sir.

          Kit bends down on the counter polished surface and blows on it.

          Miss Wilson looks at her with a perplexed eye.

          Kit stands up and smiles to Miss Wilson. Further along the

          counter, a couple of middle-aged customers stare at her. She turns

          her face toward them.

                          KIT

           Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch.

          The couple walks away.

          Miss Wilson looks at the leaving couple, then looks at Kit with a

          suppressed smile.

          Kit smiles back at her.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - SWIMMING POOL - EXTERIOR DAY

          Long shot on the swimming pool, seen from the terrace above the

          pool. A woman in bathing suit is coming up the stairs to the

          terrace, drying her daughter with a pink towel.

          Reverse medium shot on the stairs. Vivian and Kit are coming down

          the stairs. The mother and her daughter are coming up. Vivian is

          wearing a very elegant dark pink suit with a white shirt. Kit has

          put a grey denim jacket over her panther-decorated bra, but she is

          also wearing a very short and tight black skirt. Vivian has put

          her arm in the crook of Kit's elbow.

          The camera follows Kit and Vivian.

                          VIVIAN

           Listen, I've been calling you.

                          KIT

           Yeah, I know. They told me at the Banana you were looking

           for me.

                          VIVIAN

           You were supposed to come by Tuesday. I left the money at

           the desk.

                          KIT

           I was hiding out from Carlos.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, if you picked up the money, you wouldn't have to

           hide.

                          KIT

           Hey, I was busy. I had a life, you know. Nino got beat up.

           We had to visit him in the hospital. Rachel got arrested.

           It was a mess. Anyway, I got the money.

          Kit waves the envelope with the money inside.

                          KIT

           Thank you very much for saving my ass. Now Carlos can get

           off of it.

          Now the two girls have reached the bottom of the stair, and they

          are walking between the dinner tables surrounding the pool.

                          KIT

           You know, he was talking about you last night. He would

           bust something if he saw you in this outfit.

          Reverse shot. The camera is a couple of yards in front of Vivian

          and Kit, and we see the two girls coming toward us.

                          KIT

           I was afraid to hug you up there. I might wrinkle you !

          Vivian lets go of Kit's arm and laughs.

                          KIT

           You look really good.

          Vivian points to a table.

                          KIT

           No, something with shade.

          Vivian points to another table.

                          KIT

           You clean up real nice. You sure don't fit in down on the

           Boulevard looking like you do, not that you ever did.

          Kit sits down. Then Vivian also sits down.

                          VIVIAN

           Well, thanks, but it's easy to clean up when you got money.

                          KIT

           Yeah. So, when does he leave ?

                          VIVIAN

           Tomorrow.

                          KIT

           You get to keep the clothes ?

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah. Edward asked me if I wanted to see him again. But I

           think... I think definitely no. I mean, it's just another

           week, right ?

          Kit has put her chewing gum into a teaspoon and she puts the spoon

          on the table.

                          KIT

           Definitely no.

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah.

          Kits looks worried.

                          KIT

           Oh, no.

                          VIVIAN

           What ?

                          KIT

           I know this weepy look on your face.

                          VIVIAN

           Oh, no, you don't !

                          KIT

           You fell in love with him.

                          VIVIAN

           No. Kit, please. Stop it.

                          KIT

           You've fallen in love with him ?

                          VIVIAN

           Kit !

                          KIT

           Did you kiss him ? On the mouth ?

                          VIVIAN

           Uh, yeah, yeah... I did.

                          KIT

           You kissed him on the mouth ?

                          VIVIAN

           I did. It was nice.

                          KIT

           You fall in love with him, and you kiss him on the mouth.

           Did I not teach you anything ?

                          VIVIAN

           Look, I'm not stupid, okay ? I'm... I'm not in love with

           him. I just... I like him.

                          KIT

           You like him ?

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah.

                          KIT

           You definitely like him. Well, he's not a bum. He's a rich,

           classy guy.

                          VIVIAN

           Who's gonna break my heart, right ?

                          KIT

           Oh, no. Come on. You don't know that. Hey, he asked you,

           right ? Maybe you guys could, like, um, you know, get a

           house together. Like, buy some diamonds and a horse. I

           don't know.

          Vivian laughs.

                          KIT

           Anyway, it could work. It happens.

                          VIVIAN

           When does it happen, Kit ? When does it really happen ? Who

           does it really work out for ? Did it work out for Skinny

           Marie or Rachel ? No !

                          KIT

           Those were very specific cases of crackheads.

                          VIVIAN

           I just wanna know who it works out for. You give me one

           example of somebody that we know that it happened for.

                          KIT

           Name someone ?

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah, one person that it worked out for.

                          KIT

           You want me to give you a name or something.

                          VIVIAN

           Yeah. I'd like to know.

          Kit presses her hands on her temples.

                          KIT

           Oh, God, the pressure of a name.

          She sighs and takes her hands out of her temples.

                          KIT

           Cinder-fucking-rella.

          Vivian laughs. Kit starts laughing too.

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY

          The sidewalk in front of Edward's office building.

          Medium shot of Edward walking from the curb, carrying his

          briefcase. He climbs the stairs that reaches to the upper level of

          the sidewalk and the entrance of the building. He slows down when

          he hears a father talking to his son

           THE FATHER (voice over)

           If you do, I'll give you a piggy-back ride when you... See,

           I told you so... Not quick enough for the old man !

          He laughs. Edward stops to look at him.

          Reverse shot on the father and his son. The father is wearing a

          dark-blue tracksuit with advertisements printed on it. The son,

          about ten year-old, is wearing a white shirt and beige slacks. The

          father is carrying a cheap briefcase. They are running around a

          lamp-post.

                          THE FATHER

           Winner gets a piggy-back. Come on, saddle up, boy.

          He bends down for his son to climb on his back. The son jumps on

          his back. The father sighs.

          Back on Edward, standing in the middle of the stairway, and

          looking at the father with a smile.

           THE FATHER (voice over)

           Oh, Zachary ! Too many doughnuts.

          Father and son laugh. Edward starts walking again.

          Long shot on the large terrace in front of the building. Edward is

          crossing it toward the entrance. He slows down to give a last look

          the the father and his son.

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium full shot on the long conference table. Edward is standing

          behind his chair at the end of the table, in front of the bay

          window. All the other ones are already seated. On Edward's right

          hand side, James Morse and then David Morse. On Edward's left hand

          side, Philip. The other seats are occupied by the various male

          assistants.

                          PHILIP

           Mr. Morse, you said this morning you wished to speak to Mr.

           Lewis. Mr. Lewis is now listening.

          Edward is pacing up and down in front of the bay window.

                          JAMES MORSE

           I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer...

           on one condition. I'm not so concerned about me, but the

           people who are working for me.

                          PHILIP

           It's not a problem. They'll be taken care of. Well, then,

           gentlemen. If we could address ourselves to the contracts

           in front of you. If you look at...

          Edward hardly listens to what Philip says. He seems worried. He

          raises a hand.

                          EDWARD

           Excuse me, Phil.

          Philip looks up at him.

                          EDWARD

           Gentlemen, I'd like to speak to Mr. Morse alone. Thank you.

          Philip seems surprised by what Edward just said. A bit

          reluctantly, he says :

                          PHILIP

           All right, gentlemen, you heard the man. Please wait

           outside.

          All the assistants stand up to leave the room.

                          EDWARD

           You too, Phil.

          Philip, still seated, looks up at Edward. He looks very surprised

          and chuckles nervously.

                          PHILIP

           What do you mean ?

                          EDWARD

           I mean I would like to speak to Mr. Morse alone.

          Philip stands up and points toward David Morse.

                          PHILIP

           Why does he get to stay ?

          James Morse makes a discreet sign to his grand-son to enjoin him

          to leave the room.

          Edward and Philip are standing, facing each other.

                          EDWARD

           Please, please.

          Reluctantly, Philip starts moving away.

                          PHILIP

           I'll be right outside.

                          EDWARD

           Good.

          Philip leaves the room, followed by David.

          Full shot. Edward is still standing in front of the bay window. He

          manipulates the control of the vertical Venetian blinds, to dim

          the daylight in the room.

          Close shot of James Morse looking at him questioningly.

                          EDWARD

           Is that better ?

                          JAMES MORSE

           It's all right.

          Medium shot of Edward standing near the coffee table.

                          EDWARD

           Would you like a cup of coffee ?

                          JAMES MORSE

           Black.

          Edward takes the coffee pot to pour the coffee. He sighs loudly.

                          EDWARD

           Mr. Morse, my interests in your company have changed.

                          JAMES MORSE

           What is it you're after now, Mr. Lewis ?

          Edward brings the cup on the table in front of James.

                          EDWARD

           Well, I no longer wish to buy your company and take it

           apart. But I don't want anyone else to, either. And it is

           still extremely vulnerable. So I find myself... in

           unfamiliar territory. I want to help you.

                          JAMES MORSE

           Why ?

          standing on either side of it. But they can't hear what is said

          inside the room. Philip gives a quick look at David and walks away

          toward the center of the hall.

          James.

                          EDWARD

           Mr. Morse, I think we can do something very special with

           your company.

                          JAMES MORSE

           What about our Navy contracts ?

                          EDWARD

           Ah, they weren't dead. Just delayed. I... bluffed a little

           bit.

          Medium shot of James, who chuckles.

                          JAMES MORSE

           You're very good at it.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you very much. It's my job.

          He bends down and chuckles. Then he stands up from his chair.

                          EDWARD

           I think we can leave the details up to the others.

          More slowly than Edward, James stands up.

                          JAMES MORSE

           I find this hard to say without sounding condescending,

           but... I'm proud of you.

          He puts his hand on Edward's shoulder. Edward seems moved by this

          gesture.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you. I think we can let in the other suits now.

           Let's continue the meeting.

          He goes back into the meeting room, followed by Philip, David and

          all the assistants.

          Through the open door, we see James Morse, standing at the back of

          the room, near Edward's chair. He motions to the men to sit down.

                          JAMES MORSE

           Come in, gentlemen. Sit down.

           Edward, please, what was this all about ? Hmm ?

          Edward slaps him on the arm.

                          EDWARD

           It's all yours, Phil. Finish it up.

          on the table to look at the documents.

           PHILIP (voice over, heard through the door)

           Hold it. Hold it. These aren't signed ! These aren't

           signed ! Could someone please tell me what the fuck is

           going on here ?

          from the door carrying his briefcase.

           You know, I think I'm gonna go for a walk. Just stay here

           for a while. I'll be back.

                          DARRYL

           Yes, sir, Mr. Lewis.

          Close shot on Vivian's bare feet walking on the rug. The door bell

          is chiming. Vivian puts down a large hat box on the floor, and she

          walks to the front door. The camera tilts up and we see her full

          body. She is wearing the same dark pink suit she was wearing when

          she was with Kit by the swimming-pool. She opens the door to

          Philip.

          Close up shot on Vivian's face : she doesn't seem very happy to

          see Philip.

          Reverse shot on Philip, a strange sneer on his face.

                          PHILIP

           Well, well. Hello again. I'm looking for Edward.

                          VIVIAN

           Edward's not here. I thought he was with you.

                          PHILIP

           No. Uh, Edward is definitely not with me.

          He walks in without waiting for Vivian to invite him in.

          He chuckles. Vivian closes the front door.

                          PHILIP

           No, if Edward were with me...

          He puts his briefcase down on the floor and walks into the room.

                          PHILIP

           When. Actually, when... Edward was with me, he didn't blow

           off billion dollar deals !

          He walks to the bar and helps himself for a drink.

                          PHILIP

           I think that, uh, Edward's with you. That's what I think.

           Mind if I have a drink ?

          He pours whisky in a glass without waiting for Vivian's answer.

                          VIVIAN

           No.

          He holds the glass toward her.

                          VIVIAN

           No, thank you.

          She walks away from him.

                          PHILIP

           Well, I'll just wait.

          She sits down on the sofa, crosses her legs on the couch and

          starts writing in a notebook. Behind him, Philip sits down on a

          stool near the bar.

                          VIVIAN

           Uh, Edward will be back soon. Any minute, he'll be home.

          Medium shot on Philip at the bar. He stands up and slowly walks

          toward her. The camera follows him.

                          PHILIP

           You know...

                          (HE CHUCKLES)

           ...this is not home. This is, uh, a hotel room. And, uh,

           you are not... the little woman.

          He sits down on the sofa, next to Vivian. She uncrosses her legs

          and lets them down on the floor. He puts his glass on the low

          table, crosses his fingers and snickers.

                          PHILIP

           You're a hooker. Maybe you're a very good hooker, you

           know ?

          She puts her notebook on the low table.

                          PHILIP

           Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care about losing

           millions of dollars. Because I have to be very honest with

           you right now, Vivian.

          He moves slightly closer to her. She seems very tense by the

          situation.

                          PHILIP

           Right now I really do care. I really do. And right now I am

           really pissed, you know ?

          He moves his hand toward her bare leg. She glares at him.

                          PHILIP

           Right now I am just freaking out. So maybe if I screw you,

           huh...

          He puts his hand between her legs. She moves it away.

                          PHILIP

           ...and take you to the opera, then I could be a happy guy,

           just like Edward.

          He keeps on trying to fondle her, and Vivian keeps on trying to

          get rid of him.

                          VIVIAN

           Hey, get off me !

          They start fighting. He stands up.

                          PHILIP

           Hey, hey ! Goddamn it !

          She bites his hand.

                          PHILIP

           Ow !

          He slaps her face very hard. She falls down on the floor.

                          VIVIAN

           Ow !

          He kneels down beside her and grabs her.

                          PHILIP

           Come on ! Come on ! I'll pay for it.

                          VIVIAN (SCREAMING)

           Get off me ! Ow ! Get off me !

                          PHILIP

           How much is it ? Twenty bucks, thirty bucks ?

                          VIVIAN (SCREAMING)

           Get off me ! Get off me !

                          PHILIP

           Fifty ? You a fifty dollars whore, Vivian ?

          Edward, who has come silently into the room, grabs him from

          behind, and forces him to stand up.

                          PHILIP

           What are you doing ? Get off !

          Quick shot on Vivian slowly getting up from the floor.

          Back on Philip and Edward fighting.

                          EDWARD

           Stop. I don't want to hurt you ! Stop it !

                          PHILIP

           I don't know how to tell you this. You already did,

           Edward !

          Edward pushes him toward the front door, which is still open.

                          PHILIP

           All right, all right.

                          EDWARD

           Out. Out of here.

          Philip falls down on the floor. He slowly stands back up

                          PHILIP

           Look, she's a whore, man. She's a goddamn... Aah !

          Edward very violently punches him in the face. Philip falls down

          on the floor.

          Quick shot on Vivian, seated on the sofa. She starts when she sees

          Edward punching Philip.

          Philip slowly stands up, his hand on his face. Edward looks at his

          hand, who seems to hurt him after the violent punch he gave to

          Philip.

                          EDWARD

           Aah ! Damn. Shit. Goddamn !

          He picks up Philip's briefcase and throws it through the open

          door. It falls on the floor of the hallway.

                          PHILIP

           I think you broke my nose.

                          EDWARD

           Get out of here.

                          PHILIP (SCREAMING)

           What is wrong with you ? Come on, Edward ! I gave you ten

           years ! I devoted my whole life to you !

                          EDWARD

           That's bullshit. This is such bullshit ! It's the kill you

           love, not me ! I made you a very rich man doing exactly

           what you loved. Now get out of here !

                          (YELLING)

           Get out !

          Philip, subdued, walks slowly out.

          Quick shot on Vivian, still seated on the sofa, and still very

          moved by what just happened.

          Back to Edward, slamming the door behind Philip. He looks very

          upset.

          Later.

          Close up on a box full of ice cubes. One of Edward's hands is

          taking the cubes out of the box. The other hand, the one which hit

          Philip, is wrapped in a white napkin. He puts the cubes in another

          white napkin and wraps the napkin around the cubes.

           VIVIAN (voice over)

           Why do guys always know how to hit a woman right across the

           cheek ?

          Close up on Vivian's face. She is touching her red cheek.

                          VIVIAN

           Wham ! And it feels like your eye is gonna explode. What do

           they do ? Do they pull you aside in high school and show

           you how to do this ?

          We see Edward's hand holding the napkin with the ice inside. He

          puts it on Vivian's cheek.

                          VIVIAN

           Is that... Ow !

          Even the light touch of the napkin seems to hurt her.

          The camera moves slowly away, widening the shot, and showing

          Edward in shirtsleeves bending over Vivian, without her jacket,

          and lying on the sofa.

                          EDWARD

           Not all guys hit.

                          VIVIAN

           I heard about what you did with Morse.

                          EDWARD

           That was a business decision.

                          VIVIAN

           It was good.

                          EDWARD

           It felt good.

                          VIVIAN

           I think this is okay.

          She moves his hand away, and slowly sits up in the sofa.

                          VIVIAN

           I gotta get going.

                          EDWARD

           Yes, I noticed you're packed. Why are you leaving now ?

                          VIVIAN

           Edward, there'll always be some guy, even some friend of

           yours, thinking he can treat me like Stuckey, thinking that

           it's allowed. What are you gonna do ? You gonna beat up

           everybody ?

                          EDWARD

           That's not why you're leaving.

          She stands up from the sofa.

          Full shot on the sofa, with Vivian standing up and Edward still

          seated.

                          VIVIAN

           Look, you made me a really nice offer. And a few months

           ago, no problem. But now everything is different, and

           you've changed that. And you can't change back. I want

           more.

          Edward stands up from the sofa.

                          EDWARD

           I know about wanting more. I invented the concept. The

           question is how much more.

                          VIVIAN

           I want the fairy tale.

                          EDWARD

           Impossible relationships.

          Vivian has put her jacket back on and she is putting her shoes on,

          seated on the step that goes across the room.

                          EDWARD

           My special gift is impossible relationships.

          Full shot on the room. Edward has taken his wallet, and he is

          taking money out of it. He throws the wallet on a table and sits

          down on the steps next to Vivian.

          Medium shot on the steps. Edward gives the money to Vivian.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you.

                          VIVIAN

           You're welcome.

          She puts the money in the pocket of her jacket. He is holding a

          business card in his hand.

           If you ever need anything... dental floss, whatever... you

           give me a call.

          They both chuckle.

                          VIVIAN

           I had a good time.

                          EDWARD

           Me too.

          She stands up from the steps, and starts collecting her luggage.

          Edward, who had remained seated on the steps, stands up.

                          EDWARD

           Do you want me to get you a bellboy ?

          She is putting the garment bags on her arm.

                          VIVIAN

           No, I got it.

          He bends down to pick up a bag.

                          EDWARD

           I'll carry this.

                          VIVIAN

           Thanks.

          She starts moving toward the front door. He walks ahead of her and

          starts opening the door, then closes it.

                          EDWARD

           Stay. Stay the night with me. And not because I'm paying

           you, but because you want to.

                          VIVIAN

           I can't.

          She seems very sad. She opens the door. He holds it for her.

                          EDWARD

           Good-bye.

          She starts moving out, then stops and smiles to him

                          VIVIAN

           I think you have a lot of special gifts.

                          EDWARD

           Mmm.

          Edward closes the door without looking at her.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

          Close shot on the marbled floor. There is a black spot on it.

          Barney and an uniformed attendant are kneeling on either side of

          the black spot.

                          THE ATTENDANT

           I didn't do it, sir.

                          BARNEY

           No, no. Now, I didn't say that. I want you to call

           maintenance and have them deal with this. You must delegate

           authority.

          Vivian's legs walk in and stop between the two men.

                          THE ATTENDANT

           Yes, sir.

                          VIVIAN

           Hi, Barney.

          The camera tilts up and we see the faces of all of those three

          people. The two men stand up

                          BARNEY

           Miss Vivian.

          The attendant doesn't move away and looks at Vivian with a light

          smile. Barney looks at him.

                          BARNEY

           Thank you.

          The attendant walks away.

                          VIVIAN

           I wanted to say good-bye.

                          BARNEY

           Well, then, I gather you're not accompanying Mr. Lewis to

           New York.

                          VIVIAN

           Come on, Barney. You and me live in the real world... most

           of the time.

                          BARNEY

           Have you arranged for transportation ?

                          VIVIAN

           I'm gonna call a cab.

                          BARNEY

           Allow me.

          He points to Darryl, whom we don't see, and calls him.

                          BARNEY

           Darryl.

           DARRYL (voice over)

           Yes, sir.

          Darryl walks near Vivian.

                          BARNEY

           Please take Miss Vivian anywhere she wishes to go.

                          DARRYL

           Yes, sir.

          Darry walks away. Vivian holds her hand out to Barney. Barney

          bends down and lightly kisses the extended hand. Then he shakes

          it.

                          BARNEY

           It's been a pleasure knowing you. Come and visit us again

           sometime.

                          VIVIAN

           Stay cool.

          She slaps him on the arm and walks away. Barney turns around and

          looks at her walking away.

          Full shot on the limousine driving away from the curb in front of

          the hotel.

          We hear the song It Must Have Been Love, performed by Roxette.

          LIMOUSINE - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of Vivian seated in the back of the limousine, looking

          very pensive.

                          LYRICS

           Lay a whisper On my pillow. Leave the winter On the ground.

          Vivian turns around to have a last look at the hotel.

                          LYRICS

           I wake up lonely...

          Vivian turns back and look absently in front of her, with the same

          pensive, slightly sad, look on her face.

                          LYRICS

           ...The stare of silence In the bedroom And all around.

                          LYRICS

           I close my eyes And dream away.

          The scene dissolves into :

          PENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR EVENING

          Medium shot taken from outside the terrace, of Edward standing

          near the balustrade. His vest is open and he has taken his tie

          off. He tries to look over the balustrade, but can't.

                          LYRICS

           It must have been love, But it's over now. It must have

           been good...

          He walks away from the balustrade, and back into the penthouse.

                          LYRICS

           ...But I lost it somehow. It must have been love, But it's

           over now.

          The camera lets Edward go inside the penthouse and pans to the

          right along the wall and the foliage decorating the terrace.

          The picture dissolves into the foliage on the other side of the

          French window and :

          The camera pans to the left from the foliage to a medium shot on

          the window.

          Edward comes out on the terrace. He is fully dressed in an elegant

          grey suit. The camera follows Edward. We hear some thunder

          rumbling in the distance. Edward moves to the balustrade. He is

          holding a jewel case in his hand. It is the one with Vivian's

          necklace inside.

          A bell boy is coming out on the terrace. He has some luggage in

          his hands.

                          BELL BOY

           Is that everything, sir ?

                          EDWARD

           Yes. Yes, that's everything.

                          BELL BOY

           I'll meet you downstairs, sir.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you.

          The bell boy walks away from the terrace, carrying luggage.

          More thunder and end of the music.

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Close shot on kit, seen through the window. It's raining. She is

          holding a picture of her and Vivian. She chuckles.

                          KIT

           We look so dopey.

          Medium shot inside the room. Kit is seated near the window,

          holding a Teddy Bear on her laps. She stands up.

                          KIT

           San Francisco's not that great, you know.

          She walks toward Vivian, who is wearing slacks, a white T-shirt

          and a dark jacket. Her hair is tied into a bun.

                          KIT

           It's bad climate. It's foggy. It's unpredictable.

          The camera moves back into a full shot of the room.

          Vivian is putting things away in a bag.

                          VIVIAN

           I'll wear a sweater.

                          KIT

           What are you gonna do there ?

          She sits down.

                          VIVIAN

           Get a job. Finish high school. I got things I can do. I

           used to make pretty good grades in high school.

                          KIT

           Yeah, I could see that about you. I could see that.

          She turns around to face Kit.

                          VIVIAN

           Sure you won't come with me ?

          Kit looks around her.

                          KIT

           And leave all this ? Not in a million.

          She laughs.

                          VIVIAN

           Come here.

          Kit stands up, puts the Teddy Bear down, and walks toward her.

          Vivian takes some money out of her pocket. She puts the money in

          the breast pocket of Kit's denim jacket.

                          KIT

           Whoa. Whoa. What is this ?

                          VIVIAN

           It's part of the Edward Lewis scholarship fund. We think

           you got a lot of potential, Kit De Luca.

                          KIT

           You do ? You think I got potential ?

                          VIVIAN

           Oh, yeah. Don't let anybody tell you different, okay ?

                          KIT

           Okay.

          Vivian is crying.

                          VIVIAN

           Take care of you.

          She puts a cap on Kit's head.

                          KIT

           No, I can't, I can't. It's your favorite.

          She takes it off and gives it back to Vivian. She walks away.

                          KIT

           What time's your bus ?

                          VIVIAN

           An hour.

                          KIT

           Yeah, well, I gotta split, 'cause good-byes make me crazy.

           So, take care of you.

          She hugs Vivian.

                          VIVIAN

           Whoa.

          Vivian slaps Kit's back, and then kisses her on the head.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot from behind the front desk. Barney is behind the

          counter, working on some paperwork. Miss Wilson is standing

          besides him, with her large glasses back on her nose. Edward walks

          to the desk. Barney smiles to him.

                          BARNEY

           Mr. Lewis.

                          EDWARD

           You don't have any messages for me, do you ?

                          BARNEY

           No, I'm afraid not, sir.

          Edward starts signing some documents on the counter.

                          EDWARD

           I'll need a car to the airport also.

                          BARNEY

           Of course. Darryl will take you wherever you need to go.

          Darryl walks to the desk.

                          BARNEY

           Darryl, the limousine out front, please ?

                          DARRYL

           Yes, sir.

                          BARNEY

           Thank you, Darryl.

          Darryl walks away. Edward pushes the signed documents across the

          counter to Barney.

                          EDWARD

           One last thing.

                          BARNEY

           Yes.

          Edward gives the jewel box to Barney.

                          EDWARD

           If you could possibly return this to Fred's for me, please.

                          BARNEY

           Yes, of course. May I, sir ?

          Edward chuckles.

                          EDWARD

           Of course, please.

          Barney opens the jewel box.

          Close up on the necklace in the box. It is the one Vivian was

          wearing at the Opera.

          Close shot on Edward looking at the necklace with a sad face.

          Then medium close shot on Barney, with a half-smile on his face.

                          BARNEY

           It must be difficult to let go of something so beautiful.

          Close up shot on the jewel box being closed by Barney.

          Back to Barney.

                          BARNEY

           You know, Darryl also drove Miss Vivian home yesterday.

          Edward doesn't answer, but his face indicates he has taken the

          information in.

          Back to Barney.

                          BARNEY

           I'll take care of it.

                          EDWARD

           Thank you, Mr. Thompson.

          Edward walks away, followed by the bell boy carrying his luggage.

          Barney looks at him with a puzzled eye.

          LIMOUSINE - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of Edward seated in the back of the limousine. He has

          an absent look on his face. It is raining outside.

           DARRYL (voice over, from the driver's seat)

           Your plane is leaving as scheduled, sir, and you should be

           back in New York on time.

          Edward gives Darryl a quick look, then look absently through the

          window. He must think about something that makes him smile a

          little.

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Vivian is also looking absently through the window of her hotel

          room.

          HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot on a fast food stand on the street. Kit is standing in

          front of the stand, talking to Angel, another prostitute whom we

          have already briefly seen early in the film in the Blue Banana

          Club. She is drinking Coca-Cola from a paper tumbler.

                          KIT

           I'm gonna have to charge you a little more rent than

           Vivian... because I've got this beauty course I'm looking

           into. I'm not gonna be there that much, you know ?

          Full shot showing the whole sidewalk with the food stand in the

          middle. On the right of the food stand, a very small temporary

          flower stand in front of a closed shop. While Kit keeps on talking

          to her prospective roommate, Edward walks behind them.

                          KIT

           'Cause you can't... You just can't turn tricks forever. You

           gotta have a goal. Do you have a goal ?

          Closer shot on the flower stand and the florist, a middle-aged

          woman. Edward has just reached the stand.

           ANGEL (voice over)

           Well, I always wanted to be in the Ice Capades.

          Edward is looking at the flowers.

                          THE FLORIST

           Help you, love ?

          Edward points to a bunch of flowers. The florist gives it to him.

                          EDWARD

           There you go. Thank you very much.

          He gives her money, takes the flowers and puts his wallet back

          into his jacket inside pocket. He walks away.

          Back to Kit and Angel at the food stand.

                          KIT

           So, you got a lot of stuff you gotta move in ?

                          ANGEL

           No, Carlos burned most of my stuff when I said I was moving

           out.

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium full shot. Vivian is putting her handbag on her shoulder,

          getting ready to move out of the room. She has already reached the

          front door, when she hears a car honking repeatedly. She stops and

          slowly turns around.

          We hear music from La Traviata, a soprano solo.

          Vivian drops the bag and walks toward the window. The music gets

          louder and Vivian has a broad smile. She walks to the window.

          SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - EXTERIOR DAY

          High angle shot of the street, as seen from Vivian's hotel window.

          The limousine is slowly driving toward the hotel. The roof of the

          limousine is open, and the upper half of Edward's body is showing

          through the open roof. He has the flowers in one hand and a black

          umbrella in the other hand. The car is honking and moves closer to

          the curb.

          The car stops in front of the hotel. Edward raises one arm, the

          one with the umbrella.

                          EDWARD

           Vivian !

          Close shot on the window. Vivian is laughing, but also ready to

          cry.

          High angle view of the roof of the car. Edward is waving both his

          umbrella and his flowers. Darryl is coming out of the driver's

          door.

                          EDWARD

           Vivian !

          Back to Vivian, waving to him.

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Vivian leaves the window.

           EDWARD (voice over)

           Princess Vivian ! Come down !

          Vivian walks to another window, the one leading to the emergency

          exit.

          SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - EXTERIOR DAY

          High angle shot of the limousine. Edward comes out of the car

          through the roof and jumps on the sidewalk. Darryl, standing near

          the car, watches the scene and smiles.

          Medium close shot on the balcony of the emergency exit. Vivian has

          come out of the room, and is smiling and looking down at Edward.

          Medium close shot of Edward, standing on the sidewalk and looking

          up at Vivian.

                          EDWARD

           Had to be the top floor, right ?

           VIVIAN (voice over, from the top of the building)

           It's the best.

          High angle shot of the emergency exit, seen from Vivian's balcony.

          We see Edward through the metal steps leading to Vivian's level.

                          EDWARD

           All right. I'm coming up.

          Back on the sidewalk level of the emergency exit. Edward grabs the

          emergency ladder with the hook of his umbrella, and brings it

          down.

          Back on Vivian's balcony. She unties her hair, an lets it wave

          down.

          Medium shot on the emergency exit. Edward is slowly climbing the

          steps, with the flowers between his teeth.

          Back to Vivian, looking down and smiling broadly.

          Back to Edward on a landing of the emergency exit. He crawls on

          it, with his back pressed against the wall.

          Close shot on Edward's face, with the flowers between his teeth.

          He stops moving and looks down.

          High angle shot on the limousine, and Darryl, smiling

          encouragingly to Edward.

          Back to Edward's close shot. He resumes his crawling walk with his

          back pressed against the wall.

          Larger shot on the emergency exit landing. Edward reaches the

          ladder leading to Vivian's landing, whose shadow we see moving

          above Edward.

          Low angle shot on Vivian's balcony. She walks on it to meet

          Edward.

          High angle shot, seen from Vivian's eyes, and showing Edward

          walking up the last steps, holding the bannister very firmly.

          Low angle shot on Vivian, standing on the top of the steps,

          laughing and looking down at Edward.

          Back to Edward, who lets go of the bannister, and opens his arms

          to Vivian.

          Close shot on Vivian walking down the steps. She reaches Edward,

          who climbs another step to be at her level. Their faces are now

          close to one another.

                          EDWARD

           So what happened after he climbed up the tower and rescued

           her ?

                          VIVIAN

           She rescues him right back.

          Slowly, their mouth meet, and they kiss passionately.

          Full shot of Vivian's hotel and the emergency exit. On the steps

          between the top landing and the one below, we see Edward and

          Vivian kissing passionately.

          End of La Traviata music.

          We hear the voice of the Afro-American man we saw at the beginning

          of the film, crossing Hollywood Boulevard.

           THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over)

           Welcome to Hollywood. What's your dream ?

          The camera moves away from the hotel and we see the Afro-American

          man coming down the street

                          THE AFRO-AMERICAN

           Everybody comes here. This is Hollywood, the land of

           dreams.

          He crosses the street.

                          THE AFRO-AMERICAN

           Some dreams come true, some don't. But keep on dreaming.

          The picture moves away to the right of the screen, to be replaced

          by a full black screen.

           THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over)

           This is Hollywood. Always time to dream, so keep on

           dreaming.

          The credits start rolling up while we hear the song Pretty

          Woman, performed by Roy Orbison.

                          LYRICS

           Pretty woman, Walking down the street. Pretty woman, The

           kind I like to meet. Pretty woman, I don't believe you.

           You're not the truth. No one could look as good as you.

           Mercy. Pretty woman won't you pardon me. Pretty woman I

           couldn't help but see, Pretty woman, That you look lovely

           as can be. Are you lonely just like me. Oh, pretty woman.

          End of music.

          A short silence, and then we hear the song No Explanation,

          performed by Peter Cetera.

                          LYRICS

           You really took me by surprise. You're someone I've needed

           for a lifetime. Your heart was cleverly disguised, And it

           didn't look that way in my mind. Tell me how could it be. I

           was the last to know. Darling, I couldn't read what was in

           your mind, To turn around and love me, With no Explanation.

           I gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would

           take it With sweet consideration. And after all that we've

           been through, I can't believe it's true Until I hear you

           say. Ooh ! I know now, now, now. Ah ! No explanation. I

           gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would

           take it.

          The music slowly fades out

          End of credits.
