        Over jungle sound effects, the CAMERA is low, moving

        through brush from the POV of a stalking animal. As the

        brush parts, revealing Wall Street and the New York Stock

        Exchange, we HEAR the resonant voice of GENE HACKMAN.

                                GENE HACKMAN (V.O.)

                  The world of investing can be a

                  jungle.

                  Bears.   Danger at every turn.

        Pretentious CLASSICAL MUSIC kicks in.

                  That's why we at Stratton Oakmont

        Absolute bedlam. 300 drunken STOCKBROKERS, most in their

        early 20s, chant wildly as JORDAN BELFORT, handsome, 30,

        stands beside a DWARF dressed in tights, cape & helmet.

                  cocksucker to nail a bullseye!

        The "bullseye" is a large dollar sign in the middle of a

        giant velcro "dartboard".

                                                                     2.

                  Watch and learn, people!

       The Brokers go apeshit as Jordan grabs the Dwarf by his

       pants and collar. In the Crowd, cash flies as side bets

       are made. Jordan winds up, aims for the "dartboard".

                                     JORDAN (CONT'D)

                  One.   Two.      Throw!!

       The Brokers cheer, and as the screaming Dwarf takes

       flight, hurtling toward camera, we FREEZE FRAME:

       Jordan, 7, smiles as he poses behind a lemonade stand,

       his parents Max and Leah behind him; Jordan, 13, stands

       A CHERRY RED Ferrari Testarossa ZOOMS down the L.I.E.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  --which really pissed me off

                  because it was three shy of a

                  million a week.

       The Ferrari weaves in and out of traffic.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  Hey, my Ferrari was white, like

                  Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.

       We see the same Ferrari, now in WHITE, as it zooms away,

       a BLONDE head bobbing up and down in Jordan's lap.

       A twin-engine Bell Jet helicopter descends over a huge

       mansion, with sparkling pool, tennis court and waterfall.

                                                                    3.

                  See that humongous estate down

                  there? That's my house.

6      INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY      (FEB `95)          6

       We see NAOMI, 24, blonde and gorgeous, a living wet dream

       in LaPerla lingerie.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  My wife, Naomi, the Duchess of Bay

                  Ridge, Brooklyn, a former model

                  and Miller Lite girl.

       Naomi licks her lips; she's incredibly, painfully hot.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  Yeah, she was the one blowing me

                  in the Ferrari, so put your dick

                  back in your pants.

       Over the following, WE SEE a quick

       All taken from TV; a mansion from Lifestyles of the Rich

       and Famous; wealthy PEOPLE applauding at a polo match;

       a yacht sailing crystal blue seas; Robert Wagner and

       Stephanie Powers toasting with champagne on Hart to Hart.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  In addition to Naomi and my two

                  perfect kids, I own a mansion,

                  private jet, six cars, three

                  horses, two vacation homes and

                  a 170 foot yacht.

8      INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT (FEB `95)                                8

       Sweaty, wild-eyed and naked, Jordan fucks an HISPANIC

       HOOKER from behind.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  I also gamble like a degenerate,

                  drink like a fish, fuck hookers

                  maybe five times a week and have

                  three different Federal agencies

                  looking to indict me.

       He dismounts, snorts some coke through a straw, then uses

       it to blow some into her asshole.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  Oh yeah, and I love drugs.

                                                                  4.

       The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages      3/5/13

     Jordan looks up suddenly, paranoid, as if he's hearing

     voices.

9    INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT     (FEB `95)                             9

     Jordan, drooling and stoned out of his skull, wears a

     rumpled custom-made business suit as he mans a set of

     controls next to his frantic co-pilot, CAPTAIN DAVE.

                               CAPTAIN DAVE

                Pull up!   Jesus! We're gonna

                crash!!

     Jordan's head bobs as he pulls back on the stick.

     The helicopter rises sharply, then levels out, hovering

     30 feet above a huge mansion. Down below, through

     Jordan's hazy, DOUBLE VISIONED POV, we see a sparkling

     pool, tennis court and waterfall.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                Check this out -- despite my

                completely fucked-up state, I

                could fly straight while still

                seeing two of everything.

     He closes one eye; his POV sharpens. Putting pressure on

     the stick, the helicopter descends slowly over the

     driving range... then LURCHES and SLAMS to the ground.

                              JORDAN

                     (to Captain Dave)

                Ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay,

                buddy.

10   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - FRONT DOOR - DAY      (FEB `95)            10

     Morning. Sober now, impeccable in suit and tie, Jordan

     heads for the door holding a glass of orange juice.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                Yes, on a daily basis I take

                enough drugs to sedate greater

                Long Island.

     He pops two white pills, swigs some juice, then speaks

     directly to the camera as he heads for a waiting limo.

                              JORDAN

                I take Quaaludes for my back,

                fifteen to twenty a day.

                                                               5.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)

                I use Xanax to stay focused,

                ambien to sleep, pot to mellow

                out, cocaine to wake up and

                morphine because it's awesome.

12   EXT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - LONG ISLAND - DAY     (FEB `95)    12

     The limo pulls up to the black glass office building.

     Jordan gets out, heads inside through a back door.

                              JORDAN

                But of all the drugs under God's

                blue heaven, there's one that's my

                absolute favorite.

13   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN'S OFFICE - DAY (FEB `95)    13

     Gadgets, computers, oxblood leather furniture. With

     the DIN of the brokerage firm bleeding in, Jordan uses

     a credit card to cut a line of coke on his desk. As he

     peels a crisp $100 DOLLAR BILL off a wad, rolls it up:

                              JORDAN

                Enough of this shit'll make you

                invincible, able to conquer the

                world and eviscerate your enemies.

     He SNARFS up the line, gestures to the cocaine.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)

                I'm not talking about this. I'm

                talking about this.

                     (Jordan unfurls the

                      $100 with a SNAP)

                Money is the oxygen of capitalism

                and I wanna breathe more than any

                other human being alive.

     He crumbles it into a ball and tosses it into a corner,

     where it comes to rest with two dozen others. Over his

     back as we TRACK HIM out of his office toward what sounds

     like the ROAR of a mob--

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                Money doesn't just buy you a

                better life -- better food, better

                cars, better pussy -- it also

                makes you a better person. You

                can give generously to the church

                of your choice or the political

                party. You can save the fucking

                spotted owl with money.

                                                                    6.

      Arms akimbo, Jordan stands above the bullpen, a huge open

      space with tightly packed rows of maple colored desks.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 But most of all, in any country in

                 the world, money can buy you love.

                 Fuck the Beatles.

      His 300 BROKERS, mostly young men with their jackets off,

      scream wildly. They worship him.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 With that in mind, at the tender

                 age of 22, after marrying my

                 girlfriend Teresa--

14A   SCENES 14A - 18 OMITTED                                            14A

      An express bus pull up -- its sign reads "Wall

      Street"....

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 --I headed to the only place that

                 befit my high-minded ambitions...

      Jordan emerges, kisses TERESA goodbye, then joins a sea

      of Commuters heading to work.

20    INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY       (MAY `87)               20

      Computers, telephones everywhere. At their desks, 45

      shirt-sleeved BROKERS read their Wall St. Journals,

      readying for war. Like an eager puppy, Jordan follows

      broker JERRY FOGEL, 30, thick-lipped and bow-tied...

                               JERRY FOGEL

                 You got a problem with that?

           Your job is `connector', which

           means you'll be dialing the phone

           over 500 times a day, trying to

           `connect' me with business owners.

           And till you pass your Series 7,

           that's all you'll be doing. Sit.

Jordan takes a seat at the desk next to Fogel's.

                         JERRY FOGEL (CONT'D)

           Just so you know, last year I made

           over 300k and the other guy you'll

           be working for made a million.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)

           A million dollars? I could only

           imagine what a douchebag that guy

           must be.

A manicured hand lands on Jordan's shoulder. It's MARK

HANNA, 30s, charismatic, movie-star handsome.

                          MARK HANNA

           Jordan? Mark Hanna.

                (re: Fogel)

           Good, you've met Jerry. One of

           the smartest guys in the office.

           Who's ever sucked a dog's cock out

           of loneliness.

Fogel's smile turns to a frown.      He hands Jordan a stack

of 3x5 index cards.

                         JERRY FOGEL

           Smile and dial. And don't pick

           your fucking head up till one.

                         MARK HANNA

           Don't mind Jerry, his father raped

           him as a child. Besides, I'm

           senior broker here, he's a

           worthless piker. I heard you

           pitched stock at your job

           interview.

                         JORDAN

           Had to do something to stand out.

                         MARK HANNA

           I fuckin' love that! Let's grab

           lunch later. Windows good with

           you?

                            JORDAN

           Great.   Yeah.

                                                            8.

  The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

Hanna gives him a wink, looks at the clock on the giant

electronic stock ticker encircling the room -- 9:30 a.m.

                            MARK HANNA

           Let's fuck!!

RING!!! Absolute pandemonium at the BELL signalling the

opening of the stock market. Feet fly off desks; Brokers

and their Connectors dial phones like mad. The CAMERA

PUSHES IN on JORDAN, mesmerized as he takes in the ROAR.

                         BROKER #1

                (to Broker #2)

           Miniscribe's a fuckin' steal!

           Thirty eight bucks a share!

                          MARK HANNA

                 (into headset)

           Your broker in West Virginia?

           What are you buying, a coal mine?

           It's the 80s, the game is high-

           tech.

                         BROKER #2

                (to Broker #3)

           Fuckface! I got 50,000 July 50s!

                         JORDAN (V.O.)

           You want to know what money sounds

           like? Visit a trading floor on

           Wall Street. Fuck this, shit

           that. Cock, cunt, asshole. I

           couldn't believe how these guys

           talked to each other--

Fogel notices Jordan sitting there frozen.        He covers his

mouthpiece, kicks the desk violently.

                         JERRY FOGEL

           Dial the cocksucking phone!

Jordan snaps out of it, starts dialing.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)

           I was hooked within seconds.

Mark Hanna slams down his phone in victory, scrawls out a

"buy" ticket. He places the ticket into a glass cylinder

which he slips into a plastic pneumatic tube.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)

           It was like mainlining adrenaline.

The tube is WHOOSHED into the ceiling and we're suddenly--

                                                               9.

21   INT. WINDOWS ON THE WORLD - DAY     (MAY `87)                  21

     CLOSE ON a COKE SPOON whose contents disappear up a

     nostril. PULL BACK TO REVEAL...

     The lunchtime power spot with panoramic views of the

     city. At a corner table, a paranoid Jordan looks around

     as Hanna does another bump of coke. None of the other

     DINERS seem to notice or care.

                              MARK HANNA

                     (offering the spoon)

                Got enough for one more? Tootski?

                               JORDAN

                No.   Thanks though.

     Hanna slips the vial into his pocket as HECTOR, the

     tuxedoed Maitre'D, approaches.

                              HECTOR

                Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for

                you on this glorious afternoon?

     Hanna surreptitiously palms Hector a $100; Jordan

     notices.

                              MARK HANNA

                Here's the game plan, Hector.

                Bring us two Absolut Martinis

                straight up. Precisely seven and

                a half minutes after you deliver

                those you'll bring two more, then

                two more every five minutes until

                one of us passes out.

                              HECTOR

                An excellent strategy, sir.

                              JORDAN

                Actually, I'm good with 7-Up.

     Jordan might as well have farted at the table.

                               MARK HANNA

                First day on Wall Street, Hector.

                Give him time.

                     (Hector offers menus)

                No thanks, I'm not eating.

     Hector heads off.

                              JORDAN

                You can get high during the day

                and still function?

                                                         10.

 The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                         MARK HANNA

           High is the only way to do this

           fucking job. Guy who coined the

           term "three-martini lunch" was a

           woman. Cocaine and hookers, my

           friend, the keys to success.

Jordan smiles, not sure if Hanna is kidding.

                          JORDAN

           I gotta say, I'm really excited

           about being part of your team.

           I wanna do all I can for our

           clients and --

                         MARK HANNA

                (reciting an ad)

           "Here at L.F. Rothschild, our

           clients aren't just important,

           they're family." Just as long as

           we get our taste first. Remember

           something, Jordan, your top

           priority in this job: make us

           money. If the clients get rich

           along the way, bully for them.

           Got a girlfriend?

                          JORDAN

           Wife.   She cuts hair.

Mark swallows a comment about that.      Gets to business.

                         MARK HANNA

           OK, first rule of Wall Street.

           Nobody -- and I don't care if

           you're Warren Buffet or Jimmy

           Buffet -- nobody knows if a

           stock's going up, down or fucking

           sideways, least of all stock

           brokers. But we have to pretend

           we know. Make sure you stay

           relaxed. Nobody wants to buy

           something from someone who sounds

           like they haven't gotten laid in a

           month. Take breaks when you feel

           stressed, jerk off if you can.

           You like jerking off, right?

                           JORDAN

           Well... sure.

                         MARK HANNA

           Good, jerking off is key. And I

           highly recommend cocaine, which

           will make you dial faster, which

           is good for me. Churn `em and

           burn `em, baby.

                                                              11.

      The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

     A BUSBOY stops by with a fresh napkin for Mark who thanks

     him. Then, discreetly as possible, Mark removes a fresh

     vial of cocaine tucked within and takes a quick snort.

     Jordan realizes: that's why he palmed the maitre d' $100.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                For the next six months I learned

                the ways of Wall Street.

22   INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT    (OCT `87)                           22

     As STRIPPERS grind in b.g, Jordan parties with Mark Hanna

     and dozens of BROKERS and TRAINEES. Jordan sips a

     martini and studies Mark Hanna, hitting on a STRIPPER.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                That fall I passed my Series 7.

                Finally it was here.

23   INT. ROTHSCHILD BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY      (OCT `87)          23

     Briefcase in hand, Jordan boards the elevator with a

     dozen other BROKERS.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                My first day as a stockbroker, a

                future Master of the Universe.

     And as the doors close, on screen WE SEE:

                        OCTOBER 19th, 1987

24   INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY      (OCT `87)            24

     Total chaos. Jordan dials the phone as all around him

     Brokers panic, screaming into headsets.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                They called it Black Monday.

                By four p.m. the market was down

                508 points, the biggest one-day

                drop since the crash of `29.

     4 p.m. The closing bell RINGS; the entire place goes

     silent. Brokers look at each other, stunned.

                               MARK HANNA

                Holy.   Fucking. Shit.

     And as the Brokers start commiserating with each other...

                                                                12.

                L.F. Rothschild, a company that

                had been in business since 1883,

                closed its doors within a month.

25   INT. JORDAN & TERESA'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY (DEC `87)       25

     Jordan sits at the table perusing the Times classifieds.

     Teresa approaches with two coffees. Sits next to him.

                              TERESA

                So I'll take an extra shift, don't

                worry about it.

                              JORDAN

                You work too much as it is.

                              TERESA

                We could pawn my engagement ring.

                              JORDAN

                We're not pawning anything. I'm

                gonna be a millionaire, Teresa.

                              TERESA

                You know that doesn't matter,

                right?

     He smiles, kisses her.     Together, they peruse the ads.

                              JORDAN

                     (points to an ad)

                "Nobody Beats the Wiz".      I could

                be a stock boy.

                              TERESA

                You're a stock broker.

                              JORDAN

                No one's hiring brokers right now,

                sweetie.

     They go back to the ads.     After a few beats, she points--

                                 TERESA

                This place is.

26   EXT. STRIP MALL - PARKING LOT - LONG ISLAND - DAY (DEC `87)      26

     In a suit, Jordan emerges from an `85 Datsun. He looks

     around confused, heads toward an unmarked storefront.

                                                              13.

27   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - DAY     (DEC `87)                     27

     The antithesis of L.F. Rothschild, with cheap furniture

     and a dozen misfit "BROKERS" giving loud, obnoxious sales

     pitches. Jordan enters, a modern man among cave people.

     DWAYNE, slovenly, 35, with a walrus mustache, looks up.

                              JORDAN

                I'm looking for Investor's Center?

                              DWAYNE

                That's us, hey. Dwayne.

                              JORDAN

                     (as they shake hands)

                Jordan Belfort, I called earlier.

                I was a broker with Rothschild.

     Dwayne motions Jordan to a seat. Nearby, a Broker in

     ratty Keds, TOBY WELCH, is screaming into his phone.

                              TOBY WELCH

                I'm tellin' you, this stock is

                goin' up!... Cause I know,

                okay?!... I have inside

                information!

     Jordan looks at him, appalled at what he's hearing.

                              JORDAN

                Where are your quotrons?

                              DWAYNE

                No quotrons, we sell off the pink

                sheets -- penny stocks.

     Dwayne slides Jordan a large thin book; its pages are

     literally pink. He explains as Jordan flips the pages:

                              DWAYNE (CONT'D)

                Company don't have enough capital

                to be listed on NASDAQ, their

                shares trade here.

                     (points to the book)

                Like these guys, Aerotyne? They

                make radar detectors out of a

                garage in Dubuque.

                              JORDAN

                Six cents a share? Who buys this

                crap?

                              DWAYNE

                Schmucks mostly. Mailmen,

                plumbers, people thinking they can

                get rich quick. They answer our

                ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler.

                                                                 14.

                              JORDAN

                The spread on these is huge.

                              DWAYNE

                So's your commission, that's the

                point. Blue chips stocks you get

                what, one percent? Pink sheets

                are fifty.

                              JORDAN

                Wait a second. You're telling me

                if I sell two thousand dollars

                worth of stock, my commission is a

                thousand bucks?

                              DWAYNE

                Technically, yeah, but not even

                the biggest schmuck buys two

                thousand dollars of this shit.

28   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - (LATER THAT) DAY       (DEC '87)         28

     As others Brokers bark into phones, Jordan sits, phone

     cradled in his shoulder, making notes. A few beats, then:

                              JORDAN

                     (into phone)

                Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan

                Belfort with Investor's Center in

                New York City. You recently

                responded to one of our ads...

     A few of the other Brokers glance over, eavesdropping.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)

                The reason I'm calling is that

                an extremely exciting investment

                opportunity crossed my desk today.

                Typically our firm recommends no

                more than five stocks per year:

                this is one of them...

     A few more Brokers look over...

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)

                Aerotyne International is a

                cutting edge tech firm out of the

                Midwest, awaiting imminent patent

                approval on a new generation of

                radar equipment...

     LATER.   Now all the Brokers listen in rapt attention.

                to only a dollar -- and our

                much, much higher -- your profit

                on a mere three thousand dollar

                investment would be upwards of

                fifty thousand... That's right,

                you could pay off your mortgage.

     Seconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing:

                that be check or money order?...

                Just like that I made two grand.

                The other guys looked at me like

                I'd just discovered fire.

                It's a rock-solid company, sir,

                it's the next Microsoft...

                Six thousand. Terrific.

                Though I knew I was selling

                garbage, within twelve weeks I

                was making a fortune.

     And as he starts scrawling out a buy ticket...

                 Seventy grand last month.

                               DONNIE

                 Get the fuck out. You made

                 seventy grand in one month.

                               JORDAN

                 Seventy two actually.

      Donnie studies him, isn't sure if he's full of shit.

                               DONNIE

                 Tell you what. You show me a pay

                 stub with $72,000 on it, I'm

                 quitting my job right now and

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                And he did quit his job, which

                I thought was a little weird.

                I mean I had just met this

                fucking guy.

     A few beats, then into phone:

                Yo Paulie, it's Donnie...     Yeah,

                listen, I quit.

     Jordan studies Donnie as he continues his conversation...

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                There were other things about him

                too, like his phosphorescent white

                teeth and the fact that he wore

                horn rims with clear lenses to

                look more Waspy. He also married

                his first cousin --

     Jordan sits in mid-conversation with Donnie over beers.

                              DONNIE

                No problem, if we have a kid who's

                a retard, we'll just leave it on

                the steps of some institution.

     And as they continue drinking...

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                He was also a closet drug fiend.

                I'd known him less than a week

                before he talked me into smoking

                crack.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                The weird thing was when he'd do

                crack, his face would contort into

                this bizarre, frozen mask like the

                Phantom of the Opera.

     Donnie does a hit of crack; his jaw twitches, then his

     facial muscles contort, locking up like a stroke victim.

     After a few beats, he hands the pipe to Jordan.

                              DONNIE

                You now, take a hit!

     Jordan takes a deep hit and holds it.      A beat, then:

                              JORDAN

                Omigod, I fuckin' love you!!

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                Which turned out to be a great

                move - Donnie was a fast learner

                who transitioned into the penny

                stock business quickly.

      The camera PUSHES IN on Jordan as he stands before a

      large dry erase board.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 But what if they didn't sound like

                 jerk-offs? What if I took this

                 bunch of nincompoops and molded

                 them in my own image? I

                 reinvented the company, gave it a

                 new image, a new name. Something

                 patrician, blue-blooded, something

                 that reeked of tradition and anti-

                 semitism.

      And as his Brokers settle in to folding chairs--

                               JORDAN

                 Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton

                 Oakmont.   The clients we've gone

                 after in the past -- they're done.

                 We will now target exclusively the

                 wealthiest one percent of

                 Americans. The methods we've used

                 -- over. Loud, obnoxious sales

                 hype is worthless with these

                 people.

                                                              23.

                In military terms it's like carpet-

                bombing -- noisy, menacing and

                only marginally effective. As

                Stratton brokers you will be laser-

                guided smart-bombs aimed at high-

                priority targets. You will

                establish an initial relationship

                with your clients selling only

                blue chip stocks -- then and only

                then will you attempt to sell the

                pink sheets, where the real money

                is. Now the key to every sale is

                this:

     Jordan writes the word "URGENCY" on the board.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)

                No one buys stock unless he thinks

                it's going up and going up now.

                You must convince your client to

                buy before the takeover happens,

                before the lawsuit is settled,

                before the patent is granted.

                If he says I'll think about it and

                call you back, it's over, you're

                dead! No one calls back! So you

                have to create urgency --

     Another day. With Stratton Oakmont signage visible in

     CLIENT, the other Brokers listening in.

                              JORDAN

                --and once Kodak settles the

                lawsuit, institutions will be

                permitted to buy their shares in

                large blocks again. And when that

                happens, which is any day now,

                what do you think will happen to

                the price of Kodak stock?

                                CLIENT   (O.S.)

                It'll go up?

                              JORDAN

                Exactly. Which is why you should

                pick up 5000 shares today, a

                $200,000 investment.

                agreed that the stock's going up,

                then the only real objection he

                has at this point is he doesn't

                trust you! And he shouldn't trust

                Month end, March 1991! $28.7

                million in gross commissions - all                  *

                in Stratton issues. Not bad for                     *

     The place goes WILD with applause.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)

                And to celebrate with a weekly act

                of debauchery, I have offered our

                lovely sales assistant Danielle

                Harrison ten thousand dollars to                    *

                have her head shaved!

     Jordan motions to DANIELLE HARRISON, 19, pretty, sitting       *

     in a chair nearby. Behind her, Rugrat uses clippers to

     shave her thick brown mane. The place goes nuts.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)

                FYI, Danielle tells me she's using

                the money for breast implants! Is

                this a great company or what?!!

     More wild applause as Jordan signals across the bullpen

     to Donnie. We hear the opening strains of "Stars &

     Stripes Forever" as he opens the door to a

     COLLEGE MARCHING BAND

     dressed in underwear and hats. The music continues as

     somersaulting GYMNASTS and BATON-TWIRLERS bring up the

     rear. As they march through the bullpen to cheers--

     FROM THE KITCHEN -- two dozen TUXEDO-CLAD WAITERS emerge

     carrying trays of champagne and hors d'oeuvres. The

     music continues as two dozen STRIPPERS bolt in, gyrating

     among the BROKERS. As Jordan surveys the insanity:

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                Word spread throughout Wall

                Street -- I was becoming a legend.

                Forbes Magazine even called to do

                a profile on me...

     Bustling with activity. Jordan enters, crosses toward

     three dozen YOUNG MEN in business suits. He approaches

     his assistant JANET, 20s, dressed all in black.

     They spot Jordan, start clamoring, waving their resumes.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                Forbes had made me a superstar.

                Every day dozens of money-crazed

                kids beat a path to my door with

                resumes they hadn't even bothered

                to spellcheck.

     Jordan crosses through the packed bullpen, where 150

     BROKERS, no older than 22, are crammed elbow to elbow

     talking into phones. Some have pets, which they tend to

     while they work -- iguanas, snakes, turtles, even a

     chimp. Others are getting shoulder rubs by Masseuses

     or being fitted for suits by a TAILOR. Over the above:

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                If we hired `em, they dropped out

                of college overnight and blew

                whatever allowance they had on a

                new suit from our in-house tailor.

                The median age of our brokerage

                couldn't get served in the bar

                down the street.

                Not this guy though -- what the

                fuck is he even doing here? He

                read the Forbes article, too, but

                with equal parts cocaine,

                testosterone and body fluids.

                 Actually the madness started on

                 our brokers, Ben Jenner,

                 christened the elevator by

                 getting a blowjob from a sales

                 credit, she did have   an amazing

                 technique, with this   wild twist

                 Eventually Ben married her, which

                 Anyway, in an attempt to maintain

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 We called him Mad Max because of

                 his hair-trigger temper, which

                 could be set off by something as

                 innocuous as a ringing telephone.

      The phone RINGS.

                               MAX

                 Who the hell has the goddamn gall

                 to call this house on a Tuesday

                 evening! Goddammit!

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 But then the weirdest thing would

                 happen. Though he'd never been

                 near England, he'd pick up the

                 phone and affect an ever-so-slight

                 British accent.

      Greatly agitated, Max stomps toward the phone.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 This was his other persona -- the

                 super polite, ever-gracious Sir

                 Max.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 It was absolutely bizarre. He'd

                 hang up...

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 In Stratton parlance, there were

                 three kinds of hookers. There

                 were blue chips, the top of the

                 line. Model material. They were

                 priced between $300 and $500 and

                 made you wear a condom unless you

                 gave them a hefty tip, which I

                 always did.

                 in the two to three hundred

                 dollar range.

     He turns and exits.    Jordan watches him go, thinking.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                It was obscene -- in the normal

                world. But who wanted to live

                there?

     Dozens of luxury cars parked outside. On a balcony,

     Jordan is mid-speech, in a bathing suit, addressing the

                "If you wanna party with the boys,

                you gotta wake up with the men."

      Donnie gesticulates wildly. The guys crack up. WE PUSH

      IN ON Donnie, practically drooling, as Jordan gives us a

      quick tutorial on ludes...

79A   QUAALUDE TUTORIAL                                              *79A

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 The quaalude was first synthesized

                 in 1951 by an Indian doctor --

                 that's dot Indian, not feathers --

                 as a sedative, and was prescribed

                 to stressed housewives with sleep

                 disorders. Pretty soon someone

                 figured out that if you resisted

                 the urge to sleep for fifteen

                 minutes, you got a pretty kick-ass

                 high from it. Didn't take long

                 for people to start abusing ludes,

                 `course, and in 1982 the U.S.

                 Government Schedule One'd them,

                 along with the rest of the world.

                 Which meant there was only a

                 finite amount of these things

                 left. No shit, you can't even

                 find `em anymore today. You

                 people're all shit outta luck.

Jordan suspects Donnie may actually be onto something.

But just then...

                           SEA OTTER

           Holy fuck.

Jordan peers over the balcony where Sea Otter's looking.

NAOMI LAPAGLIA. 22, the hottest blonde ever, has entered

the party with her date BLAIR. She smiles, full lips

parting over perfect white teeth, a ridiculously short

dress barely covering her long tan legs and full breasts.

                         RUGRAT

           My nutsack's about to explode.

           Someone's gotta take that down.

There's no debate who that someone should be. Eyes

locked on Naomi, Jordan makes his way downstairs.

WITH NAOMI taking in the party, her eyes flitting to

things: art, chandeliers, crystal, etc.

                         NAOMI (V.O.)

           A lotta people would look at me

           and think: "golddigger, she's out

           to land the richest husband she

           can." But you see, I came from

           nothing. Like, below the poverty

           line. And when you come from

           nothing, being rich means never

           having to go back to that.

Jordan approaches CRISTY, 20s, one of his guests.

                         CRISTY

           Jordan, hey.

                (he smiles; Cristy

                 picks up his intent)

           Have you met my friend Naomi?

Jordan takes Naomi's hand, doesn't let go.

                           JORDAN

           Naomi.

                         NAOMI

           You have an awesome house. I

           don't think I've ever been in a

           house like this.

           You like it? I just got it. I

           guess it's okay. Six bedrooms,

           two hot-tubs, one off the master

           suite overlooking the water. You

           like to jet-ski?

Naomi's date Blair offers his hand to break them apart.

Toby Welch lurks behind him, giving him the evil-eye.

                          BLAIR

           Hi.   Blair Hollingsworth.

Jordan barely acknowledges him, focused on Naomi.

Outside, HILDY AZOFF chats with Teresa. Her eyes stray

to Jordan chatting up Naomi. Teresa's eyes follow hers

and sees them. Ouch. Hildy goes.

                         JORDAN

           You're telling me you've never jet-

           ski'ed in your life?!

                           NAOMI

           Never.

                         BLAIR

           Y'know, we really should hit it,

           there's two other parties we're

           s'posed to get to --

                           JORDAN

           What?    You just got here.   Stay.

Naomi looks like she'd like to.     Hildy approaches,

introduces herself, then:

                         HILDY

           Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

                           JORDAN

           With what?

                         HILDY

           I dunno, you'll have to ask your

           wife what she wants.

Jordan sees: Teresa is watching from afar.

                         DONNIE(O.S.)

           Oh sweet Jesus!

Jordan turns to see a drunk Donnie, cock in hand, jerking

off to Naomi. Hildy comes running over.

                                                                   44.

                Donnie!   What the fuck are you

                doing?!

     During the melee that follows -- Hildy admonishing

     Donnie, Blair removing Naomi from the party --

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                The day I met Naomi was the day I

                truly became the Wolf. Every guy

                wanted her -- so I had to have

                her.

     -- Jordan watches her go. Naomi shoots a glance back to

     him and, like that, he's hooked.

                Say hi, Rocky.

     Naomi waves Rocky's paw.     Jordan smiles.

                              NAOMI (CONT'D)

                Why don't you light a fire? I'll

                be right out.

     Jordan nods, takes in her scent as she walks away.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                God, please help me. How can I

                fuck this girl?

     As he crouches by the fireplace, his skypager vibrates.

     He checks the readout: "Teresa". His face falls as he

     hits the "silent" button, mind racing with guilt.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                That's it, you're leaving. You're

                going home to your wife.

     Jordan stands, turns around -- NAOMI is in the doorway,

     naked except for high heels.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                As you can probably guess, I

                fucked her goddamn brains out.

                                                               47.

86   INT. NAOMI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    86

     Rocky yaps incessantly as Jordan pounds away atop Naomi.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                For eleven seconds.

     Jordan cums loudly, convulsively.

                                 JORDAN

                I'm sorry, I--

                                 NAOMI

                Did you cum?

                     (nods; gasping)

                Yeah, but I'm still hard.

     Jordan looks down at her.

                              JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                Being inside her... was like your

                cock went to heaven and God

                himself was cupping your balls.

     And as they start fucking again...

     BACK to see the apartment is packed with flowers.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                Every chance we got, we'd sneak

                off together...

89   INT. LIMOSINE - NIGHT (AUG `92)                                 89

     Giggling like a child, Jordan pours coke from a vial,

     creating a little mound atop one of Naomi's breasts.

                              JORDAN

                Hold still, don't move.

                     (to the Driver)

                Watch the potholes!

      The Wolf of Wall Street     Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

     More giggling, then he snorts the coke off her breast,

     burying his face in it as he climbs on top of her. Naomi

     laughs uncontrollably as the limo glides to a stop. The

     door opens from outside -- the Doorman?

                              TERESA (O.S.)

                Get out of the fucking car.

     Jordan looks up, locks eyes with Teresa. He jumps off

     Naomi, stumbles out, closing the door behind himself.

     The limo takes off.    Teresa starts crying...

                You're like a totally different

                person.

                               JORDAN

                I'm not. I'm sorry.        I made a

                mistake, okay?

                              TERESA

     Jordan says nothing.       Finally, Teresa starts sobbing.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                I felt horrible.

     Jordan holds her, letting her cry.

                                                                49.

                Three days later I filed for

                divorce and moved Naomi into the

                apartment.

91   INT. JORDAN'S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - DUSK            91

     Completely remodelled, all new furniture.   Jordan and

     Naomi sit at the table, set for a candle-light dinner.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)

                Say what you will, but the Duchess

                did have style. She brought in a

                decorator, feng shui'd the place--

                she even hired a gay butler.

     NICHOLAS THE BUTLER, 40s, enters with hot towels on a

     silver tray.

                              JORDAN

                Thank you, Nicholas.

     Jordan takes a towel, wipes his face.      Naomi smiles.

                              JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                He was smart, sophisticated,

                really great. Except for that

                He must have thought I was at my

     like it's on fire.

                              NAOMI (CONT'D)

                It gets worse. After I chased

     With Nicholas seated in a chair, Jordan sits across from

     him. Pacing behind him is Donnie, coked-up, face

     contorted, frothing with rage. Nearby, giant Chester

     Ming sits quietly, saying nothing.

                              JORDAN

                I should kill you, cocksucker!

                You do not fuck with this man!

     Jordan holds Donnie off.    Turns back to Nicholas.

                You were high, things got out of

                Fine.

     Jordan nods to Chester. Without a word, he crosses to

     Nicholas and BAMMM!! Nicholas's nose splits open like a

     ripe plum, blood spurting everywhere. Tough-guy Donnie

     takes one look, then SPEWS vomit into a garbage pail.

     And as Chester pummels Nicholas's face into chopped

     meat...

                              JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                It's amazing the kind of loyalty

                money will buy. I mean Chester

                almost killed this prick.

     Chester starts to hang Nicholas over the balcony by his

     legs. Jordan stops him.

           The SEC sent two lawyers down to

Jordan speaks directly to camera as he continues walking

through the bullpen.

                         JORDAN

           See an IPO is an initial public

           offering, the first time a stock

                                NAOMI

                 Omigod!   Aunt Emma!

      Naomi rushes over, hugs her AUNT EMMA, 50s, demure,

      British. Naomi turns, calls out to Jordan, who is now in

      a huddle with the guys, his back to her.

                                   NAOMI (CONT'D)

                 Jordan!   Look!

      Jordan turns, then crosses to them, smiling.

                               AUNT EMMA

                 Jordan dear, how lovely.

                               JORDAN

                 It's so nice to see you again.

      As he leans in to hug her, Aunt Emma spots some white

      powder on the edge of Jordan's nostril. Deftly, she

      wipes it off, smiling.

                               AUNT EMMA

      Aunt Emma leans in to his ear.

                 I lived through the 60s, my dear.

                 Enjoy the day.

      And with that, she turns back to Naomi.

                       (re: his crotch)

                 And don't think that impresses me

                 much.

      Jordan looks down: he has a morning erection.

                               JORDAN

                 I wasn't flexing my arms. You're

                 just lucky to have a husband who's

                 in such great shape. Now get over

                 here and kiss me!

                                 NAOMI

                 Kiss you?!

      Splash! She nails him one last time, then storms out.

      He stands there dripping wet. To his erection:

                               JORDAN

                 Where the fuck were you last

                 night?

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 My morning ritual. First I'd get

                 up and fight with Naomi about

                 whatever I did the night before.

                                                                  61.

120A   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - STEAM SHOWER - DAY                        120A

       Jordan stands in the steaming shower.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  Next it was a steam so I could

                  sweat out whatever drugs were

                  still in my system.

120B   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS              120B

       Jordan looks at himself in the mirror.      His eyes are

       bloodshot - he looks like shit.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  After that I'd assess the damage.

       Jordan looks at a Visine bottle - "Recommended Dosage -

       Two Drops". He squirts six drops in each eye.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  What kind of maniac abuses eye

                  drops?

121    INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY (FEB `95)             121

       Fully dressed and standing amid hundreds of suits, Jordan

       pops two white pills, swigs some juice.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  Then I'd get dressed, take my

                  "back pills" to get me started,

                  then attempt to make up with her.

122    INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - SKYLAR'S ROOM - DAY (FEB `95)             122

       Jordan enters the tiny pink wonderland. On the fluffy

       pink carpet is Naomi, now in a minidress hiked above her

       hips, Manolo Blahniks showing polished red toes. Between

       her legs sits SKYLAR, their 5-month-old daughter.

                                  JORDAN

                  Hey, Skylar.

                                 NAOMI

                        (little girl voice)

                  Good morning Daddy. Where's my

                  kiss?

       Jordan kisses the baby, picks her up.

                                                         62.

 The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                         JORDAN

                (playing along)

           Does Daddy get to kiss both his

           girls?

                         NAOMI

           Ohhh, no! Daddy doesn't even get

           to touch Mommy for a very, very

           long time.

Naomi lays back on her elbows, thighs parted - she's

wearing no panties. The wind goes out of Jordan.

                         JORDAN

           C'mon, Nay, please. You know how

           sorry I am. I swear I--

                         NAOMI

                (cutting him off)

           Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

           And from now on it's going to be

           nothing but short, short skirts

           around the house! And Mommy's

           so sick and tired of wearing

           panties, uhhh. In fact she's

           decided to throw them all away.

                (parting her thighs)

           So take a good look. You'll be

           seeing an awful lot of it around

           the house, but no touching.

She licks her lips seductively.     Jordan sets Skylar

aside, starts grovelling.

                         NAOMI (CONT'D)

           What's wrong, Daddy?

Naomi slips her index finger in her mouth, starts sucking

it. Jordan can barely speak.

                         JORDAN

           C'mon, why are you doing this?

           I said I'm sorry.

                         NAOMI

                (pouting)

           Ohhhh poor, poor Dada. He loves to

           say how wrong he is when he's

           ready to come in his own pants.

           Isn't that right Dada? Mommy loves

           Daddy so, so much and there's

           nothing she wants to do more right

           now than to make love to Daddy all

           day long. Well, I guess it's time

           for Daddy to be taught his first

           lesson.

                                                                  63.

       The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages     3/5/13

      Naomi runs her fingers over her stomach and on to her

      inner thigh, then up toward her vagina. Jordan watches

      transfixed, then a change comes over him...

                               JORDAN

                 I wouldn't do that if I were you

                 Mommy. I think Mommy should hear a

                 story before she decides to please

                 herself like that.

                 Can Daddy tell Mommy a story?

                      (off her nod)

                 And does mommy promise to keep her

                 legs spread wide, wide open the

                 whole time?

                      (she nods dreamily)

                 Good. Once upon a time there was

                 a great big mansion in Long Island

                 and the people who lived there had

                 lots and lots of money. But of

                 all the possessions they had,

                 there was one thing that was much

                 more valuable than all the rest

                 combined, and that was their

                 little baby daughter.

      Naomi listens, legs still spread, hand on her crotch.

                               JORDAN (CONT'D)

                 Now because he was very security-

                 conscious, the Daddy hired two

                 full-time guards, big hairy men

                 both named Rocco, and they

                 installed security cameras all

                 around the house. And one of

                 those cameras is right over

                 Daddy's shoulder.

      Naomi's eyes widen -- she look toward a Teddy Bear on a

      shelf. WE SEE that one of the eyes is a pinhole camera.

                               JORDAN (CONT'D)

                 So smile, Mommy! You're on Candid

                 Camera!

      Mesmerized, ROCCO DAY watches a video screen, on which we

      see a grainy image of Naomi, hand between her legs.

124   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - SKYLAR'S BEDROOM - DAY (FEB `95)           124

      Naomi jumps up as if she's been electrocuted.

                                 NAOMI

                 You asshole!

      As she bolts from the room, Jordan plays with Skylar...

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 The good thing about living with

                 a world-class ballbreaker is they

                 make all the other ballbreakers in

                 your life a little easier to take.

      Donnie stands talking with Jordan's assistant, Janet.

      Jordan approaches under a head of steam.

                                  DONNIE

                 There he is.

                               JORDAN

                 Steve here yet?

                                  DONNIE

                 On his way.     Very excited.

                                JORDAN

                 Good.   Cuz we have a problem.

      He indicates out to the Bullpen.      Donnie and Janet look.

                               JANET

                      (incredulous)

                 Is he wearing a bow tie?

      In the Bullpen WE SEE a young Stratton Broker in a bowtie

      cleaning a small goldfish bowl on his desk.

                               JORDAN

                 He's got nothing better to do on

                 the day of the biggest IPO in this

      Jordan watches as Donnie marches toward the Broker in a

      bowtie...

                 Cleaning my fishbowl.

                                  DONNIE

                 Oh.

                                                                65.

        The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

       Donnie nods, turns to go, but suddenly he turns back and

       thrusts his arm in the bowl, grabbing for the squirming

       goldfish. The Broker in a bowtie looks on, horrified.

                                DONNIE(CONT'D)

                  On new issue day?! On

                  cocksucking, motherfucking

                  new issue day?!

       Dozen of Brokers and Sales Assistants look over as Donnie

       snatches up the fish. Holding it by its tail, he jumps         *

       up on the desk of the Broker in a bowtie. Now the entire

       Bullpen looks over.

                                DONNIE(CONT'D)

                  This is what happens when you fuck

                  with your pets on new issue day!

       With the flair of a showman, Donnie pops the fish in his

       mouth, swallowing it whole. The Brokers cheer wildly.

       Donnie jumps down, gets in the face of the Broker in a

       bowtie:

                                DONNIE(CONT'D)

                  Now take your bowtie, get your

                  shit and get the fuck out!

       Bowtie is stunned. And as Donnie storms off, we PUSH IN

       on Jordan, watching from across the room.

       Jordan finishes a phone call as Donnie enters with STEVE

       MADDEN, 30s, dressed in wrinkled navy blazer, cargo pants

       and T-shirt, a baseball cap over his scraggly, thinning

       hair. Jordan smiles, crosses to greet him.

                  against him. Remember those ads,

                 He came to me a few years earlier

                 when he was just starting out, so

                 I became a silent partner in his

                 company, buying an 85% stake for

                 only a million bucks.

                 The company blew up and we were

Steve clears his throat, looks over at Jordan -- he's

terrified. Jordan motions for him to calm down.

           I uh, I'd like to start by telling

           you about my background in the

           store. When I was sixteen, my

                         STEVE MADDEN

           No. Heh-heh. Not like that.

           I mean somehow I became fascinated

           with the endless design

           possibilities for women's shoes--

          BROKER #5                        BROKER #6

Queer!                            Get a fucking life!

Boos, hisses. Steve looks at Jordan, who motions for him

to speed up. He grabs a shoe from one of the boxes.

                            STEVE MADDEN (CONT'D)

           This shoe --    the Mary Lou -- is

           the one that    really put me on the

           map. It's a     black patent leather

           variation of    the Mary Jane, but--

SPLAT! A half-eaten grapefruit lands at Steve's feet.

In a flash, Jordan rushes over, grabs the mic--

                                                           68.

                         JORDAN

           All right, let's hear it for Steve

           Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou!

Huge applause, with stomping feet; howling, etc.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)

           Okay, now that you got that out

           of your system, I want you to know

           why Steve is so completely off the

           fucking wall... It's because this

           man is a creative genius. Steve's

           power, his gift -- is that he

           creates trends. Artists like

           Steve come along once a century!

           Elvis! Andy Warhol!    Giorgio

           Armani! Who knows how high this

           stock could go? The 20s? The

           50s? The 80s?

Applause; war whoops.      Jordan motions for quiet.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)

           I want everybody to look down.

           See that little black box in front

           of you? It's called a telephone.

           Now I'm gonna let you in on a

           little secret about this

           telephone -- it won't dial itself!

           That's right -- until you take

           some action, it's nothing more

           than a worthless hunk of plastic,

           like a loaded M16 without a

           trained Marine to pull the

           trigger. And in the case of the

           telephone, it's the action of you,

           a highly trained Strattonite, a

           killer who will not take no for an

           answer!   A person who will not

           hang up the phone until his client

           either buys or fucking dies!

The Brokers go crazy.      Jordan looks around.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)

           I don't care if you graduated from

           Harvard or Bumfuck University or

           never got past fourth fucking

           grade! That phone is the great

           equalizer!

                (pause; looks around)

           There is no nobility in poverty.

           I've been rich, and I've been poor

           and I choose rich every time.

                                                         69.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)

           At least as a rich man, when I

           have to face my problems, I show

           up in the back of a limo wearing a

           $2000 suit and $40,000 gold watch!

Jordan takes off his GOLD WATCH, flings it to the Crowd.

Brokers go nuts, fighting over it like a home-run ball.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)

           And if anyone here thinks I'm

           crazy, get the fuck out and get a

           job at McDonald's, because that's

           where you fucking belong! But

           before you depart this room full

           of winners, I want you to take a

           good look at the person next to

           you, because one day in the not-so-

           distant future, you'll be sitting

           at a red light in your beat-up old

           Pinto, and that person's gonna

           pull up in a brand new Porsche,

           with their gorgeous young wife at

           their side. And who will you be

           next to? Some ugly beast with

           three days of razor-stubble in a

           sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in

           next to you with a carload of

           groceries from the fucking Price

           Club!

He scans the Brokers; they're on the edge of their seats.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)

           So you listen to me and listen

           carefully. Are you behind on your

           credit card bills? Good. Pick up

           the phone and start dialing. Is

           your landlord threatening to evict

           you? Good. Pick up the phone and

           start dialing. Does your

           girlfriend think you're a fucking

           loser? Pick up the phone and

           start fucking dialing! I want

           you to deal with your problems by

           becoming rich! I want you to go

           out and spend money! Leverage

           yourself, back yourself into a

           corner, let the consequences of

           failure become so fucking

           unthinkable that you'll have no

           choice but to do whatever it takes

           to win!

The Brokers go absolutely APESHIT.

                                                                70.

                  Of course I couldn't have done

                  this without help. I'd leaked the

                  word on Wall Street that Stratton

                  was a buyer up until twenty. So

                  not only were we pushing Madden,

                  all the big firms were too.

       We continue PANNING the frenzied Brokers...

                 shares back at the top of the

                 up as high as I fucking wanted.

      sits at his desk, speaking directly to camera:

                 Of the two million shares being

                 offered for sale, a million

           before?

As Jordan rifles through some papers, Denham's eyes scan

the deck, casually cataloguing everything.

                         AGENT DENHAM

           A boat? Learned to sail when I was

           six.

                         JORDAN

           I mean, one like this. Just had

           her extended to put a chopper on

           the back.

Jordan points out the Bell-Jet helicopter.

                         AGENT DENHAM

           Never been on a boat with a second

           mode of transportation on top of

           it.

Jordan finds the file he's been looking for, offers it.

                                                         75.

                         AGENT DENHAM (CONT'D)

                (before he'll accept)

           What is this?

                         JORDAN

           Names and addresses of every guest

           at my wedding. Friends, clients. I

           even threw in the seating chart.

           Heard that's why you wanted the

           video, figured this'd expedite

           whatever it is you're doing.

                (Denham looks: it's

                 indeed a guest list

                 from the wedding)

           I wanted to show you I've got

           nothing to hide. I know you're

           investigating Stratton but for the

           life of me I can't figure out why.

           Sure, my company is unorthodox;

           what brokerage isn't? Maybe we're

           a little louder than most but we

           don't do anything illegal. Talk to

           the SEC, they'll tell you, they

           checked us out up and down.

                         AGENT DENHAM

           The SEC's actually a civil

           regulatory agency. We pursue

           criminal activity.

                         JORDAN

           That's what I'm saying. You guys

           take on real crime. Which is why

           I'm so curious: what do you think

           we did?

The reason Jordan asked him here, Denham realizes.

                         AGENT DENHAM

           I can't discuss ongoing

           investigations.

                           JORDAN

           I understand.

                         AGENT DENHAM

           Though, to be frank, this case

           kinda got dumped on my desk. Some

           higher-up felt your shop needed

           looking into after all that press,

           fell on me to do the looking.

                         JORDAN

           You know who you should be looking

           at? Goldman, Lehman Brothers,

           Merrill.

                                                         76.

 The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)

           What those guys're up to with

           collateralized debt obligations?

           This internet stock bullshit?

           C'mon. If you want, I'll walk you

           through exactly --

                         AGENT DENHAM

           -- that'd be great. And if there's

           anything you can give me just to

           close out your file, get it off my

           desk--

                         JORDAN

           -- sure, get you back to the real

           criminals --

                         AGENT DENHAM

           -- then we could both profit from

           this little sit-down.

Jordan sizes him up: what did Denham mean by "profit"?

                         JORDAN

           You sure you don't want anything

           to drink? Water for your pal?

                (Denham demurs)

           Rumor is your started out in

           finance. Even got your broker's

           license before you joined the

           bureau.

                         AGENT DENHAM

           Who told you that?

                          JORDAN

                (searches his memory)

           Jeez, who was it...?

                (comes up short)

           Ever regret it? Giving up the

           money-crazed, pin-striped life?

           Ever think where you'd be if you'd

           stuck with it?

                         AGENT DENHAM

           When I'm riding the subway home,

           sweating my balls off, in a suit

           I've worn three days, sure.

                         JORDAN

           Whattaya pull in working at the

           bureau, if you don't mind me

           asking. 50-60K a year?

                         AGENT DENHAM

           Just about. We get a free handgun

           out of it, though, that doesn't

           suck.

                                                         77.

 The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                         JORDAN

           S'crazy, the world we live in, the

           jobs with real value, the ones we

           should appreciate -- firefighters,

           teachers, FBI agents -- those are

           the ones we pay the least.

                         AGENT DENHAM

           Way of the world.

                         JORDAN

           That's one thing I like about what

           I do, the opportunity to make that

           right. Take this kid we had

           interning last year. Didn't want

           to be a broker, wanted to be an

           environmental scientist or

           something, he had a student loan

           debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway,

           his mom gets sick, all they can

           afford is third-rate care. Some of

           us got together, made an

           investment on his behalf and --

           boom -- overnight everything

           changes, she's seeing the best

           doctors in the country. Sadly,

           didn't work out, she passed but

           still: having the power to do that

           makes all the other bullshit worth

           while.

                (as Denham considers

                  that)

           See, it's all about proper

           guidance, Pat. Knowing someone

           with the right relationships,

           who's discreet. I can change a

           life almost every day.

They measure each other.

                         AGENT DENHAM

           How much that intern make off your

           deal?

                         JORDAN

           North of half a million.

Denham summons Agent Hughes over. To Jordan:

                         AGENT DENHAM

           Can you say that again, what you

           told me?

                (Jordan declines with

                 a smile; to Agent

                 Hughes)

           I believe Mr. Belfort just tried

           to bribe a federal officer.

                                                         78.

 The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                         JORDAN

           What? I was making conversation.

                         AGENT DENHAM

           Sounds like that to me, Jordan.

                         JORDAN

           ...no, no, no...

                         AGENT DENHAM

           ...sounded like that...

                         JORDAN

           ...no, to constitute a bribe,

           don't I have to make an explicit

           offer of money for services? With

           an exact dollar figure attached?

           All I said was "north" of half a

           million. According to the U.S.

           Criminal Code, that dog won't

           hunt, Pat.

                (then)

           Heard you were a straight arrow.

           That you wouldn't bend the rules

           other agents might. He was right.

                         AGENT DENHAM

           You did a background check on me?

                         JORDAN

           Figured you were looking into me,

           was only fair. Plus you sail on a

           yacht fit for a Bond villain,

           sometimes you gotta act the part.

                         AGENT DENHAM

           This is why you invited me down to

           your yacht? With a couple hookers

           on it --

                         JORDAN

           -- those are friends --

                         AGENT DENHAM

           -- to get a sense of the guy who

           was coming after you?

Jordan puts his hands up: "you got me."

                         JORDAN

           Thanks for coming down. Now get

           off my boat.

                         AGENT DENHAM

           You know, most of the Wall Street

           jackasses I bust, they were born

           to the life.

                                                                79.

                 Their father was a douchebag

                 before them, and his father before

                 that. But you, you got this way

                 all on your own. Good for you,

                 Jordan.

                      (as he starts to go)

                 Thank you for having us. I'm

                 absolutely certain we'll see each

                 other again.

                      (before he does)

                 You know, this is about the nicest

                 boat I've ever been on. Just think

                 what a hero I'll be in the office

                 when the bureau seizes it.

      Jordan watches him go, temper flaring: he can't let

      Denham get the final word. He calls after them:

                               JORDAN

                 Hey, Denham! I'm gonna eat a claw

                 of lobster now as I get my cock

                 sucked by Heidi down below. You

                 have a super ride home on the

                 subway thinking about that!                          *

      As he watches them pull away, seething --

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                 He was a numbers guy, a follow-the-

                 fucking-money'er. He wasn't gonna

                 come at me through my guys,

                 looking for a weak link and a

                 quick kill. He was gonna come at

                 me like an accountant would, the

                 way Ness got Capone, through my

                 books. Which meant? It was ass-

                 covering time.

138   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY      (SUMMER `95)   138

      As Naomi looks on, 5 months pregnant, Jordan packs a

      suitcase.

                                 NAOMI

                 Switzerland?    What the fuck is in

                 Switzerland?

                                JORDAN

                 Swiss cheese, Naomi, what do you

                 fucking think?

139   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY               *139

      Jordan sits talking with Rugrat and Donnie.

                                                               80.

       The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 Rugrat set up a meeting with a

                 Swiss Banker he knew from law

                 school who could launder our

                 money, but it wasn't till noon

                 the next day.

      Jordan glances at his watch, washes down a few ludes.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 I knew if I timed my lude intake

                 right, I'd sleep through the

                 entire overnight flight.

140   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (SUMMER `95)         140

      Jordan stands before the Bullpen talking to his Brokers.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 At four p.m. I popped a few ludes,

                 which started kicking in by the

                 time I finished our sales meeting.

                 This was the tingle phase.

141   INT. CANASTEL'S - NIGHT    (SUMMER `95)                        141

      Over dinner, a visibly high Jordan ravenously digs into

      his food as Donnie and four Blue Chip Hookers look on.

                               JORDAN   (V.O.)

                 By dinner I popped a few more on

                 top of some cocktails and an

                 valium or two. The slur phase.

142   INT. DANCE CLUB - NIGHT    (SUMMER `95)                        142

      On the crowded dance floor, Jordan gets knocked around

      like a marionette, saliva strung from his mouth.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 By eight thirty I'd done a few

                 more and pretty much lost my motor

                 skills. This was the drool phase.

143   INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT (SUMMER `95)                          143

      Jordan is barely conscious as a Hooker rides him.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 And by ten I didn't know who or

                 what I was doing -- the amnesia

                 phase. We boarded the plane just

                 before midnight.

                                                               81.

144   INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - NIGHT (SUMMER `95)        *144

      Jordan boards, slurring, drooling, completely wasted.

                               JORDAN

                      (to a Stewardess)

                 Sweetheart! Look at you!

      And as he hugs her, then stumbles toward his seat...

145   INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - DAY (SUMMER `95)          *145

      Quiet; morning sunlight bleeds through the window.

      Jordan's eyes flicker open. He yawns, looks around,

      tries to get up; he can't move. He looks down, sees

      six seat belts restraining his arms and legs. Jordan

      looks over at Donnie, mouth agape, asleep next to him.

                                JORDAN

                 Donnie.   Donnie, wake up.

                                 DONNIE

                 Nuuhh?

                               JORDAN

                 Untie me, shitbag. You think this

                 is funny?

                               DONNIE

                 I didn't tie you, the captain did.

                 He almost tasered you.

                                 JORDAN

                 Why?

146   FLASHBACK --                                                   146

      As PASSENGERS scream, Jordan wildly humps a STEWARDESS,

      the CAPTAIN struggling to restrain him.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 This was fucking great. I hadn't

                 laundered a dime yet and already

                 I was under arrest.

      A pensive Jordan sits, mind racing.

                 Worse yet was the plastic baggie

                 of ludes that Donnie'd stuffed up

                 his ass.

       Jordan trades looks with Donnie, who shifts

       uncomfortably.

       JEAN-JACQUES SAUREL greets them. 30s, suave. The lobby is

       ultra-modernist.

                                SAUREL

                  Jordan Belfort! At last!

                  Nicholas has told me so much.

                                JORDAN

                  Nice to make your acquaintance.

                  This is some lobby you got.

                                SAUREL

                  Ah, yes. We gave our designer an

                  unlimited budget and he exceeded

                  it. Come! You must tell me all

                  about your adventure with the

                  stewardess over coffee!

       They disappear upstairs.

151   INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - SAUREL'S OFFICE - DAY               151

      Jordan, Rugrat and Donnie drink coffee with Saurel and

      one other SWISS BANKER. It's an impressive office, with          *

      an enormous fish tank.

                               DONNIE

                 We have a joke in America.

                 "Heaven is a place where the

                 police are Brits, the chefs are

                 Italian, the car mechanics are

                 German, the prostitutes are French

                 and the bankers are Swiss." I

                 never got it `til now -- look at

                 those fucking fish! Come here,

                 little guy...

                               SAUREL

                 Yes, we have the same joke here.

                 Only sometimes the English are

                 chauffeurs and the chefs are

                 French. The Germans, alas, are

                 always mechanics; no one wants to

                 grant them more authority than

                 that.

      Polite laughter. Jordan, not as impressed by the fish,

      cuts straight to the point:

                               JORDAN

                 I'm curious about your bank

                 secrecy laws.

                               SAUREL

                 Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom

                 requires ten minutes of idle chit-

                 chat before business can be

                 discussed.

                      (a smile)

                 Of course, let's get "down to it."

                 What would you like to know?

                                JORDAN

                 Under what circumstances would you

                 be obligated to cooperate with an

                 FBI or U.S. Justice Department

                 investigation?

                                   SAUREL

                 Ca depend.

                                   JORDAN

                 Ca depend?      Ca depend on what?

                                                          84.

 The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                         SAUREL

           Whether America plans to invade

           Switzerland in the coming months.

                         RUGRAT

           Want me to see if tanks are

           rolling down the Rue de la Croix?

More chuckles.   Through Jordan's forced smile:

                         JORDAN (V.O.)

           What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,

           is are you going to fuck me over.

                         SAUREL (V.O.)

           I understand perfectly, you

           American shitheel.

Saurel smiles.

                         SAUREL

           The only way the Banque Real de

           Geneve would cooperate with a

           foreign legal body is if the crime

           being pursued also happened to be

           a crime in Switzerland. But there

           are very few Swiss laws pertaining

           to your "rumored" improprieties.

           Which is why Mr. Azoff's joke is

           most appropriate: from a financial

           standpoint you are now in heaven,

           and we welcome you. If the U.S.

           Justice Department or FBI or SEC

           or IRS sent us a subpoena, it

           would become papier-toillette. We

           would wipe our ass with it.

Everyone's impressed.      Except Jordan.

                         JORDAN

           Unless it was an investigation

           into stock fraud -- which is a

           crime in Switzerland. Then you'd

           have to cooperate.

                         SAUREL

                (now he's impressed)

           Yes, we would. Assuming the

           account is under your name.

           However, if it were in the name of

           a nominee of yours...

They take each other in.

                                                                 85.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 Was that yodeling I just heard or

                 did you just say what I thought

                 you said?

                                   SAUREL (V.O.)

                 Yes!   Yes!

      As the meeting wraps up with handshakes, Jordan's V.O.

      overwhelms Saurel's V.O..

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 He was telling me to use a

                 rathole. Problem was: sneaking a

                 U.S. rathole into Switzerland was

                 a chance I couldn't take. What I

                 needed was somebody with a

                 European passport.

      twitchy Jordan walks arm-in-arm with Aunt Emma.

                               AUNT EMMA

                 So tell me about this plan of

                 yours.

                               JORDAN

                 I'd like us to go to Switzerland

                 tomorrow so you can open an

                 account. I'll fund it, and I'll

                 pay you really well for your

                 trouble.

           Next month maybe you can fly to

           New York and we can start moving

           the cash.

                         AUNT EMMA

           Moving the cash.

                (smiles)

           I feel like a character in an

           Ian Fleming novel. It's all quite

           racy, isn't it?

                         JORDAN

           It is, and it's illegal too. Of

           course if you ever got in trouble,

           I'd come forward in two seconds,

           say I duped you, but even still.

                         AUNT EMMA

           Risk is what keeps us young, isn't

           it darling?

                          JORDAN

           I like that attitude. Promise me                      *

           you'll spend at least ten thousand

           pounds per month out of the

           account, okay?

                         AUNT EMMA

           I wouldn't even know how. I

           really do have everything I need.

                         JORDAN

           But I bet you don't have

           everything you want. How about a

           bigger apartment so your grandkids

           can sleep over?

Aunt Emma notices that Jordan is sweating, fidgety.       He's

jonesing.

           Shall we sit?

                         JORDAN

           Is she fucking hitting on me?

                         JORDAN

           hard to control the anxiety, you                      *

       Jordan fucks Naomi.    There's a curious thunk-thunk-thunk.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  When I got home, I realized there

                  was no way Aunt Emma could smuggle

                  that much cash by herself. I

                  racked my brain for another person

                  with a foreign passport.

       The bed's covered with bundles of cash. Every thrust of

       Jordan's, another bundle plummets to the floor -- thunk.

       Donnie watch as Brad tapes stacks of cash to his wife

       CHANTALLE, a bombshell in panties, bra and sneakers.

                 As a successful drug dealer, Brad

                 spent his winters in the South of

                 France, which is where he met his

                 wife Chantalle, a stripper of

                 Slovenian origin but born in, of

                 all places, Switzerland.

      Chantalle is completely taped up, a cash-covered mummy.

      Jordan looks on with Brad, Donnie and now Naomi. 90% of

      the cash is still on the bed.

                               JORDAN

                               NAOMI

                 It's gonna take her like fifty

                 trips.

                               BRAD

                 We'll get her parents to tape up

                 too. They got Swiss passports.

                 Plus her brother and his wife.

                 Five people, six-seven trips?

                 probably do it just for the miles.

           You'll "call" me.

                (what part don't you

                 understand?)

           And you can come "pick it up."

Brad asks Jordan if they can speak in private.

MOMENTS LATER, IN PRIVATE: Jordan joins Brad.

                           JORDAN

           What's wrong?

                          BRAD

           I dunno if he's stupid or a junkie

           but he's a loose fuckin' cannon.

           I don't trust him and I don't want

           him around me.

           Jesus. I thought he was your best

           I only sell to him cuz he's your

           friend.

                         JORDAN

           Can you just do one trip for him?

Brad stews.   It's asking a lot.

                         BRAD

           I'll meet him but I won't pick up.

           I have a limit of how much of that

           douchebag I can take.

       Brad waits by his Range Rover as Donnie's Rolls careens

       into the lot. He emerges, briefcase in hand.

      Bored, Jordan and Donnie sit on the couch watching

      "Family Matters" on TV.

      With Jordan running on the treadmill, Donnie pumps away

      on an exercise bike nearby. They're both sweating.

                               DONNIE

                 This is bullshit, man. My fucking

                 metabolism's pumping and I don't

                 feel shit.

      Donnie leans over, picks up the bottle.         Reads the label.

      He shakes out more pills, two more apiece. As they pop

      them, a very pregnant Naomi descends the stairs, now very

      pregnant.

       Jordan can't respond. Phone still to his ear, his

       eyelids droop. Drool spills from his slackened jaw.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  After fifteen years in storage,

                  the Lemmons had developed a

                  delayed fuse.

       JORDAN'S POV -- is hazy as he stares at his own

       reflection in the pay phone.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  It took 90 minutes for the little

                  fuckers to kick in, but once they

                  did -- pow! I had skipped the

                  tingle phase and went straight to

                  the drool phase.

       JORDAN'S POV -- the phone gets further and further away.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  Actually I'd discovered a new

                  phase: the cerebral palsy phase.

       BAMMM!! Jordan hits the floor with a thud, crashed out

       on his back. From the dangling phone, we hear:

                                BO DIETL (O.S.)

                       (over phone)

                  Jordan! Jordan! Do not get behind

                  the wheel! Just tell me where

                  you're at, I'll send Rocco!

       Jordan lolls his head toward the phone, tries to reach

       for it; he can't. He lays there for a while, then:

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  C'mon, stand up!

       He rolls onto all fours, lifts a hand, topples over.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  Okay, walking is off the list of

                  options. All right, what else is

                  there?

                       (a brainstorm)

                  I can crawl, like Skylar!

       Slowly, Jordan begins crawling like an infant to the top

       of the staircase.

      The Lamborghini is parked at the bottom, twenty steps

      down. He starts to crawl down the stairs, stops. Tries

      again. Can't figure out how to do it.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                 Fuck!   The kid makes it look so

                 easy!

      An icy wind blows through his T-shirt.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 Think, you motherfucker, think!

                      (a few beats; then)

                 Wait, I've got it!

      Jordan slowly curls himself into a ball.

                                   JORDAN (V.O.)

                 I can roll!

      Forcing himself over the edge, Jordan begins to descend

      the steps, one at a time. Thump. Thump. Then faster.

      Thump- Thump-Thump. Faster still. He loses control,

      takes all the steps at once. Thump-Thump-Thump-Thump-

      Thump-Thump. He lands with a crash on the asphalt,

      drags himself up and into the Lamborghini.

      Ignition on, Jordan sits hunched over, chin resting on

      the steering wheel. Just then, the car phone RINGS.

      With great effort, he pushes the speaker phone button:

Fuck it. Jordan releases Donnie. Donnie crawls into the            *

dining room and starts shoving ham into his mouth in an            *

effort to sober up. Just then, we HEAR a horrible                  *

GAGGING sound. Donnie holds his throat as he falls                 *

backward choking, taking out the entire glass kitchen

table with a tremendous CRASH! Naomi rushes back in.               *

                         NAOMI

           Omigod, he's choking!     Jordan, do

           something!!

Just then, WE HEAR the triumphant Popeye FANFARE --

Jordan looks to the TV, where POPEYE pours a can of

spinach down his gullet. Instantly, his chest and arm

muscles swell to five times their size.

Jordan goes to get his coke. He snarfs up two fat

spoonfuls and -- like that -- his chest swells and he

takes a deep breath and he dashes back to the rescue...

Jordan rushes back to Donnie, who is now blue.

                         NAOMI (CONT'D)

           He's not breathing!

Jordan places his fingers over Donnie's artery.         Nothing.

                          NAOMI (CONT'D)

           Save him!

Jordan kneels, starts furiously pumping Donnie's chest,

breathing air into his lungs in rhythmic bursts.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)

           This stupid sonovabitch! All

           Donnie ever did was fuck me up and

           now I had to save his life `cause

           I took a CPR class when the baby

           was learning to swim. Just for

           the record, I want it noted: not

           for a second did I even think

           about letting him choke to death,

           even though it would've saved me

           an awful lot of headaches.

Donnie still isn't breathing. Jordan flips him over,

tries the Heimlich -- we hear a CRUNCH as he breaks

Donnie's ribs. He flips him back over, but he's almost

completely blue.

                                                                 103.

                  Don't let him die! He has

                  children!

       One last try. Jordan takes a massive breath, blowing as

       hard as he can into Donnie's lungs. Donnie's stomach

       distends like a balloon, then suddenly a chunk of ham

       projects from his mouth and into Jordan's face. Donnie

       coughs, vomiting. And as he starts breathing again,

       Jordan exits and passes out on the living room couch.            *

                  Legally I've never seen anyone

                  slip a noose the way you do.

                  Christ, you're lucky to be alive

                  much less not in jail.

       The troops ROAR as Jordan takes center stage.

                                JORDAN

                  I'm sure many of you have been

                  hearing rumors lately, about me,

                  about the future of this firm, and

                  that's what I'd like to talk to

                  you about today.

                       (a few beats, then)

                  Five years ago when I started

                  Stratton with Donnie Azoff, I knew

                  the day would eventually come when

                  I'd be moving on. It's truly with

                  a heavy heart that I tell you that

                  day is here.

       The place erupts in a chorus of "No!", "Don't go!", etc.

       Jordan raises his hand for quiet.

                                JORDAN (CONT'D)

                  Thank you for that and for your

                  years of incredible loyalty and

                  admiration.

The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)

           The point is though, that under

           Donnie's leadership, along with

           Robbie Feinberg and Nicky Koskoff

           moving into key management

           positions, this place is gonna be

           better than ever!

A smattering of applause. Jordan notices a few Brokers

gravely shaking their heads.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)

           And the fact that I'm gone won't

           stop me from giving Donnie advice,

           not that he needs any--

                         DONNIE

                (jumping in)

           Why would anyone in their right

           mind not follow JB's advice?

Donnie looks petrified; he's used to being an offensive

tackle, not the quarterback.

                         JORDAN

           Before I go, there's something I

           want to remind you all, and that's

           this -- Stratton Oakmont is bigger

           than any one person, even me.

           Especially me. You guys are

           Stratton, each and every one of

           you, and that is why it's sure to

           remain the best brokerage firm in

           the fucking world!

Thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom, all

300 Brokers on their feet. WE PUSH IN on Jordan.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)

           See, the very idea of Stratton is

           that when you come here and step

           into this bullpen for the first

           time, you start your life anew.

           You have a place here and no one

           can take that away from you!

           Stratton Oakmont is America! Give

           me your tired and poor! The very

           moment you walk through that door

           and pledge your loyalty to this

           firm, you become part of a family,

           you become a Strattonite! It

           doesn't matter who you are, it

           doesn't matter where you're from!

           Whether your family came over on

           the Mayflower or on a fucking

           inner tube from Haiti!

More applause. Jordan scans the young faces -- they

worship him. In the crowd he finds KIMMIE BELZER, 30s.

                          JORDAN (CONT'D)

           Everybody here knows Kimmie

           Belzer, right?

Hoots and hollers...      He raises his hand for quiet.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)

           In case any of you weren't aware

           of it, Kimmie was one of

           Stratton's first brokers, one of

           the original twenty. Now when

           most of you met Kimmie, you met

           her the way she is today -- a

           beautiful woman who drives a brand

           new Mercedes, a woman who lives in

           the finest condo complex on Long

           Island. A woman who wears $3000

           Armani suits, who spends her

           winters in the Bahamas and her

           summers in the Hamptons!

Wild applause.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)

           But that's not the Kimmie I met.

           The Kimmie I met was broke, a

           single mom on the balls of her

           ass. Three months behind on her

           rent with an eight year old son!

           She came to me for a job and when

           I hired her she asked for a $5000

           dollar advance so she could pay

           his tuition. And what did I do,

           Kimmie?

                         KIMMIE

           You wrote me a check for $25,000!

                         JORDAN

           Because I believed in you, like

           I believe in each and every one

           of you!

                         KIMMIE

           I love you, Jordan!

As the Brokers go berserk, Jordan stands basking in the

adoration. He looks at Donnie, turns back to the Crowd,

looks out at the faces. A change has come over him.

He stands there, thinking. An eternity, then:

                                                                108.

      (SUMMER `96)

      Off to the side, Jordan watches as Naomi, their Friends,

      and the yacht's Crew Members dance to blaring techno

      music. A small group of Italian SAILORS cheer them on.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 The nice thing about getting

                 rescued by Italians is that the

                 first thing they do is feed you

                 and make you drink red wine.

                 Then they make you dance.

      Jordan watches as the dancing continues, then casually

      glances out a porthole, where WE SEE the distant lights

      of a PLANE making its way across the night sky. After a

      few beats, the plane EXPLODES, a tiny flash of light.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

                 Did you see that? That was the

                 plane I sent for to come get us.

                 I shit you not, it exploded when

                 a seagull flew into the engine,

                 three people killed. You want a

                 sign from God, well after all this

                  Do you dream of being financially

                  independent but struggle every

                  month just to pay your bills?

                  this one someday but can barely

                  My name is Jordan Belfort and

                  there's no secret to wealth

                  creation. No matter who you are,

                  become financially independent in

                    The first action you have to take

                    is to DECIDE to be wealthy. When

                    I was 24 years old, I made a

                    DECISION not to just survive but

                    to THRIVE. I started my own stock

                    brokerage firm, developing a                          *

                    SYSTEM OF SELLING that within a

                 What's up her ass?

                               JORDAN

                 Had to mortgage the home to make

                 bail. Probably gonna hafta sell

                 it to pay my lawyers. If we fight

                 this thing.

      Donnie weighs that.

                                                               124.

                  The Feds say anything about coming

                  after the rest of us?

       Jordan thinks, then shakes his head no.

                                DONNIE (CONT'D)

                  You know, we're all behind you.

                  Everyone at the office.

                       (he removes an

                        envelope, hands it

                        to Jordan)

                  We bought back your mortgage. All

                  the founding partners threw in a

                  million apiece. Figured none of

                  us would have it if it weren't for

                  you.

       Jordan's profoundly touched. Donnie squeezes his

       shoulder. A real moment of friendship.

                                DONNIE (CONT'D)

                  You gotta fight this thing, baby.

       Jordan nods.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  Like I said, loyalty meant a lot

                  to me. Without your friends and

                  family standing behind you, you're

                  fucked.

           Baby, I talked to the lawyers                       *

           again today. I have some really                     *

           great news. As it turns out you're                  *

           totally off the hook.                               *

                         NAOMI                                 *

           I know that already.                                *

           You never did anything wrong                        *

           anyway, right? At the end of the                    *

           day all they really want is for me                  *

           to cooperate - that's it.                           *

           See, apparently, I know so much                     *

           about what's going on in the stock                  *

           market that I could save the                        *

           government years of heartache. But                  *

           it get's even better... You see,                    *

           if I cooperate I'll only have to                    *

           serve four short years and any                      *

           fine I'd have to pay wouldn't be                    *

           due til after I serve my sentence.                  *

           We'll still have plenty of money                    *

           left over. The only thing that I                    *

           was kind of upset about was the                     *

           fact that I might have to give                      *

           them information about my friends.                  *

                         NAOMI                                 *

           Like you said, "There's no friends                  *

           on Wall Street".                                    *

           But there's a silver lining to                      *

           that too... It turns out that all                   *

           of `em are probably gonna                           *

           cooperate too. So in the end, that                  *

           won't really be a factor.                           *

       Jordan sits alone, finishes writing a long list of names

       on a yellow legal pad.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)

                  For the next six hours, I came up

                  with a list. Friends, enemies,

                  business associates, anybody who'd

                  ever known me or taken so much as

                  a stock tip. The first name on

                  the list was Donnie's.

       And as Jordan heaves a huge sigh, we're suddenly...

231    INT. FBI OFFICE - DAY     (OCT `98)                                 231

       Agent Denham tapes a recorder to Jordan's inner thigh,

       runs a microphone wire up his chest. Agent Hughes                   *

       watches.                                                            *

                                AGENT DENHAM

                  Talk normally, breathe normally,

                  within five minutes you'll forget

                  you even have it on.

       Jordan nods, buttons up his shirt.

       Wearing a suit and tie, Jordan walks in to the bullpen,

       where the Brokers spot him, giving him a standing

       ovation. He forces a smile, waves to the crowd.

       As Robbie and Chester Ming look on, Jordan forces a smile

       as he approaches Donnie, who gives him a hug.

                                                                132.

      Jordan and Donnie sit at the coffee table over takeout

      sushi.

                               JORDAN

                 The trial won't be for months,

                 so obviously I'll be counting on

                 you to pick up the slack.

                               DONNIE

                 Whatever you need, bro.     You know

                 that.

      Jordan reaches in his jacket for a yellow slip of PAPER.

                               JORDAN

                 And you know how much that means

                 to me. Hey, you know what I

                 wanted to ask you?

      Jordan catches Donnie's eye, pushes the PAPER over in

      front of him.

                               JORDAN (CONT'D)

                 The Steve Madden deal, did he

                 ever come through on that?

      Donnie looks down at the paper, reads Jordan's writing:

       "DON'T INCRIMINATE YOURSELF.      I'M WEARING A WIRE."

                               JORDAN (CONT'D)

                 Remember he was supposed to kick

                 back like four mil from that one

                 account?

                               DONNIE

                 Uh... tell you the truth I was so

                 fucked up, I don't really remember

                 anything about that.

      Donnie slips the paper in his jacket, gives Jordan a

      look -- "Thank you." Jordan nods.

                               JORDAN

                 Well if you talk to him, let me

                 know. You want the last

                 yellowtail?

                                DONNIE

                 Why not?

                 And thus began my career as a

                 government cooperator. I was a

                 rat...

                  But I wasn't losing any sleep

                  over it.

       After a few beats, Violet knocks, enters.      Jordan stirs.

Jordan takes the pen back with a smile.        Hands it to the   *
