                           Etan Cohen & Lowell Cunningham

          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF MIRROR AVIATOR SUNGLASSES

          Standard issue throughout the south to abusive, racist prison

          guards.

          Widen to reveal that, indeed, these glasses are on the

          sneering face of just such a man.

          We follow the guard

          DOWN A DINGY PRISON HALLWAY

          Paint peeling off the rusty bars. Somewhere, someone is

          playing harmonica. Prisoners yell complaints as he passes.

          He meets them all with--

                         GUARD

          Shut up, convict! Get yer hands

          off the bars!

          The guard passes through several levels of security doors,

          deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison --

          home of the scum of the scum.

          Meanwhile...

          PRISON VISITING ROOM

          The lazy-ass guards in charge of screening visitors read

          magazines, watch TV. Footsteps -- someone's here. Which

          pisses them off, because that means they actually have to do

          their jobs.

          The unseen visitor buzzes for help. They take their time

          getting off their asses. When they finally look up, their

          gaze becomes a leer. Follow it to:

          DEVIL GIRL, the visitor. Too tall, too muscled, but hot if

          you're into that kind of thing -- an R. Crumb drawing come to

          life.

          She holds a CAKE -- the cutest, perfectly-frosted pink cake

          right off the cover of the Betty Crocker cookbook.

                         GUARD 2

          Lookie here. Yaz's visitor. I

          guess even a turd gets flies to

          land on it.

                         GUARD 3

          Me, I like a big girl.

          2.

          They smirk, hoping for a reaction. Devil girl emits a low,

          sinister growl like an angry Doberman... The guards look at

          each other and GET DOWN TO BUSINESS:

                         GUARD 2

          I.D., visitation papers.

          BACK DOWN THE HALLWAY WITH THE GUARD

          He reaches the end of the hallway. The biggest, most

          absurdly-reinforced double security door. He punches in a

          code.

          The giant door retracts -- its immense weight has it

          squeaking and groaning the whole way. Whoever's behind this

          thing must've done something REAL bad.

          WITH DEVIL GIRL

          Going through the metal detectors, waved over with security

          wands. The guards are being thorough. Maybe more thorough

          than they need to be. They check everything -- even the

          cake. The digital readout tells them NO METAL DETECTED.

                         GUARD 3

          She's clean. Well, not CLEAN, but

          you know.

          They laugh, buzz her through.

          WITH THE GUARD

          The giant door finally opens, he continues to the end of the

          hallway. Stops in front of a cell. Yells in:

                         GUARD

          Hey, Yaz! You got a visitor.

          Let's go, pretty boy.

                         VISITING ROOM

          Spare. Just a table and chairs in the middle -- poured

          concrete. Nothing a convict could, say, smash into the face

          of a guard.

          The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards -- looks

          like they're not taking chances.

          3.

          At the lone table -- Devil Girl waits with her cake. She

          hears the door open -- her face lights up as IN STEPS HER

                         BELOVED --

          YAZ, an evil hippie/biker badass right out of Easy Rider. A

          huge mane of hair, a big handlebar moustache that frames a

          grubby unshaven face...

          Everything about him seems strangely independently alive --

          every strand of hair, every fringe on his dirty jacket -- the

          way Elvis was in his prime.

          He wears a distinctive SKULL PINKIE RING. A smirk plays on

          his mouth that says -- I'm smarter than you, asshole.

          The guards escort Yaz, who can barely walk in his CHAINS and

          MANACLES. They dump him into one of the chairs. Devil Girl

          jumps up, they lock in a kiss -- it goes on too long.

          A guard pokes them with his billy club --

                         GUARD 2

          This ain't a conjugal visit.

          quit yer conjugating.

                         YAZ

          When's the last time you conjugated

          anything?

                         DEVIL GIRL

          I brought you a cake.

                         YAZ

          Thanks, darling.

                         (TO GUARDS)

          Hey could you cut this up for us?

          It's our anniversary. I'm romantic

          like that.

          A guard picks up the cake. Smirks and takes a dirty three-

          fingered scoop of frosting.

                         GUARD 2

                         (MOUTH FULL)

          Not great. She must.be good at

          somethin' else.

          They all LAUGH. He goes back for another scoop.

                         YAZ

          I wouldn't do that.

                         GUARD 2

          Why's that, convict?

          4.

                         GUARD POV:

          Where he scraped away the frosting, REVEAL A HORRIBLE ALIEN

                         MOUTH

                         GUARD 2 (CONT'D)

                         WHAT TH--

          But in a flash, the mouth SPRINGS OUT -- IT BELONGS TO A

          VORACIOUS ALIEN -- another springs out behind it -- they

          consume the guard's entire face.

                         YAZ

          That's why.

          The aliens jump into Yaz's hands like a matching pair of

          grotesque ORGANIC SIDEARMS -- as vicious and bloodthirsty as

          their master, snarling and hungry for blood.

          The guards draw their weapons, but YAZ IS FASTER.-- he

          launches his aliens, taking them all out.

          Yaz "holsters" the aliens and...

          THE PRISON BREAK IS ON!!

          One guard, badly wounded, crawls to SOUND THE ALARM

          In the reflection of a pair of blood-spattered aviator

          glasses -- Devil Girl puts the guard down with his own

          weapon.

          She uses one of the cake-aliens like a saw to get Yaz out of

          his chains.

                         YAZ

          There's nothing sexier than a girl

          killing for me.

          She runs a hand over his bicep.

                         DEVIL GIRL

          You got so strong in prison.

          Yaz notices the almost-dead guard:

                         YAZ

          I'm not just a man of brute force,

          you know. I prefer to be known for

          my rapier wit--

          His tongue SHOOTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH -- like a rapier --

          impaling the guard--

          5.

                         YAZ (CONT'D)

          --and tongue.

          The tongue retracts -- he and Devil Girl KISS.

          They collect weapons off the guards and use the aliens to saw

          open the door.

          YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL ESCAPE

          Prisoners go nuts, guards scramble -- smoke, screaming,

          chaos.

          Yaz and Devil Girl, armed with weapons they took off the dead

          guards, BLAST THEIR WAY OUT.

          He's a sociopathic badass... and she's no slouch either.

           Along the way, Yaz shoots the door off the armory and grabs

          an armload of weapons -- Shotguns, pistols, and a Rocket-

          Propelled grenade (RPG).

          He uses and discards them as he goes.

          They head for the front gate and FREEDOM...

          But..

          They turn the corner and find 50 GUARDS in FULL RIOT GEAR --

          Plexiglass shields, helmets, shotguns -- all aimed at Yaz.

          All Yaz has left is his RPG.

          GUARD ON MEGAPHONE

          Give it up, Yaz! There's no way

          out!

          A beat of stand-off -- Yaz and Devil girl facing off against

          the 50 Guards... No one blinking...

          Prisoners. watching... what's gonna go down?

                         GUARD

          You can't win. You've only got one

          shot in there!

          Yaz lets the tension linger -- he seems to enjoy it. The

          guards SWELTER in their heavy riot gear.

                         YAZ

          You look hot. Mind if I open a

          window?

          6.

          The guards share a look - huh?? Yaz grins, turns his RPG

          towards the wall behind the guards. The guards' faces go

          WIDE WITH TERROR.

                         GUARD

          Hey! Whoa! What are you doing?

          Don't do that!

          SLAM!

          Yaz blasts a hole in the wall -- the guards are IMMEDIATELY

          SUCKED OUT like from a hole blown in an airplane.

          What the...?

          Yaz steps through the hole.

                         ON YAZ

          As he and Devil girl step through the hole, take a deep,

          satisfied breath of FREEDOM.

          Reveal we are on...

          THE SURFACE OF THE MOON

          The signage on the prison reads INTERGALACTIC DEPARTMENT OF

          CORRECTIONS, LUNAR DIVISION

          Yaz looks up at the BLUE MARBLE OF EARTH, smiles.

          As Yaz fixes his gaze on our planet, his hair, his fringes

          INDEPENDENTLY ARTICULATE YAZ'S MALEVOLENT EMOTIONS... they

          also seem drawn here. Like bees, they express a collective

          intelligence.

                         YAZ

          I'm coming for you...

          Following Yaz's gaze to the Earth, we launch into...

                         CREDITS

          MiB credits fly us through the Galaxy.

          Ending on a PARTICULARLY INHOSPITABLE LOOKING PLANET

          As it revolves, we observe its strange craters and surface,

          where steaming fissures belch geysers of noxious gases...

                         7

          KAY'S VOICE (V.0.)

          When you really think about it, the

          universe is a pretty awful place.

          Full of danger, brutality, and ten

          million kinds of scum. So the

          trick is to find one or two things

          that make life in this cesspool

          worth living.

          And reveal we are actually looking at...

                         PEKING DUCK

          Rotating on a spit.

          JAY and KAY watch this awful duck rotate.

                         JAY

          That? That nasty, greasy thing

          makes your life worth living?

          There's people eating here, younger

          than that duck.

                         KAY

          I was talking about the noodles.

          Best noodles in town.

          And we are in

          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - CHINATOWN, NYC - NIGHT

          Tanks everywhere filled with strange fish. An eclectic NY

          crowd eats -- Wall Street guys, hipsters, a Chinese family or

          two, a couple of NYU professor types who love the

          "authenticity" of this place.

          KAY flashes a badge to the OWNER, Chinese.

                         KAY

          Good evening, Mr. Wu.

          MR. WU

          (heavily accented, barely

                         INTELLIGIBLE)

          Kay, Jay... So happy see you... Mr.

          Wu get you regular table...

                         KAY

          Not so fast, Wu. We'd like to take

          a look in the tanks.

                         8

          MR. WU

          Yes, you see, very fresh.

                         JAY

          The tanks in the back, Wu.

          MR. WU

          Oh... so sorry... please no

          English, you come back later...

                         JAY

          Hey, save the chop socky bullshit

          for the locals, Wu. We need to see

          the kitchen.

          MR. WU

                         (PERFECT ENGLISH)

          Why are you busting my balls, Jay?

          KAY (O.S.)

          Jay, take a look at this.

          Wu protests, Jay blows by him.

                         THE KITCHEN

                         KAY

          So this is what you're passing off

          as tuna?

          Reveal a giant tank holding a HUGE ALIEN FISH.

                         JAY

          Wow, I didn't think there was

          anything uglier than a catfish.

          Jay taps on the glass -- the fish SNARLS, making Jay JUMP.

                         KAY

          Ugly AND a clear violation of

          Health ordinance 32, selling

                         UNLICENSED EXTRATERRESTRIAL

          foodstuffs.

          MR. WU

          That's an earth fish. Very

          traditional from China. You arrest

          me, that's hate crime.

          They turn their stares on him.

          9.

                         KAY

          I guess it would be.

          (grabbing Wu's apron)

          If you were Chinese!

          Reveal -- from the waist down, Wu has the BODY OF A SLUG.

          MR. WU

          C'mon, I got larvae to feed. And

          earth fish is so expensive. This

          is the only way I could stay

          afloat.

                         JAY

          Look, Wu. You can serve it to

          your... out of town guests, but

          locals get earth fish. REAL earth

          fish. The kind that doesn't jump

          out of their stomach and get

          everyone asking a lot of annoying

          questions. Like, "Why is my lunch

          eating Daddy?" You got it?

          (back to the fish)

          DAMN, that's ugly.

          MR. WU

          Yeah, yeah, thanks guys.

                         KAY

          Aren't you forgetting something?

          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

          Wu walks them to a table, seats them.

          MR. WU

          (for benefit of customers)

          Allow me most honorable benefit of

          get you noodles.

                         (FOR GUYS)

          Be right back, guys.

          Wu walks off. Jay CLOCKS the other diners.

                         JAY

          Something about this strike you as

          weird?

                         KAY

          Yeah, look -- clean fork.

          10.

                         JAY

          Look at table two over there. They

          haven't ordered a thing. When's

          the last time Wu let someone sit at

          a table without ordering? And

          table five over there just drank

          his third cup of duck sauce.

          Now Kay's radar is up --

                         KAY

          Come to think of it... Why is Wu

          getting our noodles... outside?

                         JAY

          Because it's about to go down.

          Wu, at the door, closes the blinds. He catches them looking.

          MR. WU

          Sorry, guys.

          Wu leaves, quickly pulling the door behind, him. The guys

          reach for their weapons.

          And IT GOES DOWN --

          It's a SET-UP, and everyone in the restaurant is in on it --

          The hipsters, the families, the wall street guys -- all draw

          various forms of ALIEN WEAPONS and ATTACK

          It's like a close-quarters Mafia hit -- everyone pumping

          truckloads of ordnance at each other. Close hand-to-hand

          combat. Someone wants Jay and Kay dead and they're not

          taking any chances.

          Right ahead of the onslaught, JAY GIVES KAY A HAND SIGNAL --

          He nods, and they dive in opposite directions, SAVING

          THEMSELVES FROM GETTING HIT.

          But not for long...

          An explosive lands between them --

          Kay gets BLOWN OUT THE FRONT WINDOW, rolls to a stop in the

          middle of the

                         DESERTED STREET

          Silhouetted at the top of the block -- a biker on a

          motorcycle. As he pulls into the light -- YAZI

          11.

          Kay's eyes go wide with recognition.

          Yaz grins a murderous grin...

                         YAZ

          Some things are worth waiting for.

                         KAY

          Then come get it, you worthless

                         PIECE OF--

          Yaz guns the engine and BEARS DOWN ON KAY.

          INSIDE WITH JAY

          Getting the worst of it.

          A messy battle THROUGH THE KITCHEN.

          The Giant fish's tank gets shot -- the FISH IS FREE! And he

          goes RIGHT AFTER JAY!

                         JAY

          You probably took that whole

          catfish thing the wrong way --

          The fish SNARLS AFTER HIM -- lunges and BITES!

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          I was jealous, you know? Because

          you're so pretty!

          Jay BATTLES THE FISH-- throwing pots and pans in its mouth,

          squirting hot sauce -- working like a lion tamer to keep it

                         AT BAY--

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Kay! KAY!!! Little help! Little

          help!

          OUTSIDE WITH KAY

          Yaz getting closer. He pulls out a CANNON of a gun, fires

          into the air.

                         YAZ

          This time you don't have your

          friends to tell you what happens

          next.

                         KAY

          Oh, I know what happens next.

          12.

          Kay draws his EQUALLY BADASS-LOOKING WEAPON --

                         KAY (CONT'D)

          I've been waiting forty years for

          another shot at you, scum.

          Kay takes aim and... CLICK! Empty.

          GUN (V.0.)

          Your weapon is empty! Please

          recharge!

                         KAY

          Damn!

          GUN (V.0.)

          Sorry you're having trouble! If

          you survive this encounter, please

          call customer service at--

          Kay throws the gun at Yaz.

          Yaz laughs. Gets Kay in his sights.

                         YAZ

          All I wanted was justice, Kay.

          Justice for my brothers. But you

          had to meddle, didn't you?

                         KAY

          They deserved what they got.

                         YAZ

          Why don't you say that to their

          faces when you see them...

          Puts the barrel in Kay's face and BOOM!!!

          Yaz goes up in a GIANT EXPLOSION!!

          Reveal Jay, just fired the shot.

           Jay looks like total hell, beaten up, covered with 8 kinds of

          slime and alien guts.

          He stumbles over to Kay, who in contrast looks perfectly

          pressed.

                         JAY

          So I was thinking about making a

          chart for each time I save your

          ass. And when I do it ten times,

          you buy me lunch.

          13.

          Kay lets out a long, weary sigh.

                         KAY

          Will you settle for a drink?

          INT. DESTROYED CHINESE RESTAURANT

          Kay reaches behind the counter for a couple of beers. Jay is

          on his phone.

                         JAY

                         (INTO PHONE)

          We're gonna need a cleanup on the

          corner of Canal and Mott. And

          bring a net. Biggest one you've

          got.

          Follow Jay's gaze -- the giant fish flops its way down Canal.

          Jay and Kay back in their booth, Jay grabs a couple noodles

          off another table and starts eating.

          Through the scene, various MiB clean-up crew people work the

          crime scene.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         (MOUTH FULL)

          Why aren't you eating?

                         (GETS NOTHING)

          So what the hell was that guy?

          Kay's quiet. Ominously quiet. Weighing his words:

                         KAY

          Yaz. Put him away a long time ago.

          Biggest mistake I ever made.

                         JAY

          Why? Was he the wrong guy?

                         KAY

          No. Should've killed him.

                         JAY

          Yeah, well, don't worry, I think I

          took care of him.

                         KAY

          That was too easy.

                         JAY

          I make it look easy. That's the

          problem with being my partner.

                         (MORE)

          14.

                         JAY (CONTD)

          You get used to my game. It's what

          Dr. Phil would call taking for

          granted.

                         KAY

          You don't get it, hoss. This guy

          is different. Worse than anyone.

          He tried to blow up the Earth but I

          stopped him. He developed a

          dislike for me and for certain

          behaviors of mine, such as being

          alive.

                         JAY

          C'mon, you know better {than anyone.

          What does an MiB agent call it when

          12 alien species try to kill him?

          Tuesday.

          Jay laughs at his own joke. Kay just stares.

                         KAY

          Maybe.

          (calling off to cleanup

                         GUYS)

          Make sure you get all of him, I

          mean it! He's an assembler!

                         CLEANUP GUY

          Yes, sir, Agent Kay.

                         JAY

          Seriously, man, those noodles'll

          kill you before he does. I got

          your back.

                         KAY

          I know you do.

          Stares at his noodles a while, like there's answers in there:

                         KAY (CONT'D)

          I used to play a game with my

          daddy. What would you want for

          your last meal. Could do worse

          than this.

                         JAY

          Oh, yeah? I used to play a game

          with my dad, too. Called catch.

          I'd throw the ball, and then it'd

          hit the house `cause he WASN'T

          THERE.

          15.

                         KAY

          Do me a favor, don't badmouth your

          old man.

                         JAY

          Hard to badmouth someone you don't

          know.

                         (CHECKS HIMSELF)

          Alright, forget it. The past is

          the past. And right now we have

          something much more important to

          talk about. Bowling Night.

                         KAY

          I'm tired.

                         JAY

          Tired? What -- you afraid I'm

          gonna take that MVP trophy away

          from you?

                         KAY

          Petrified. See you later.

          Kay takes a few tired steps and turns back --

                         KAY (CONT'D)

          And slick? Watch yourself. A guy

          like Yaz can come after you when

          you least expect it. Anywhere,

          anytime.

          Jay watches Kay walk away. Looks like he's carrying a heavy

          load. Turns his attention to the clean up crew:

                         KAY (CONT'D)

          What part of clean up everything

          don't you understand? There's a

          spleen on that car!

                         CLEANUP GUY

          On it, sir.

                         DARK ALLEY

          A glow of a cigarette illuminates the face of... Devil Girl!

          She reaches down. We see -- a finger with the distinctive

          Skull, inching its way along the road.

                         DEVIL GIRL

          You okay, baby? Momma's got you.

          now.

          16.

          MIB HQ - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Jay at his desk -- papers and folders everywhere -- SEARCHING

          FOR SOMETHING.

          We see what he's looking through -- KAY'S OLD CASE FILES.

                         JAY

          Yaz... Yaz... Yaz... Where are you,

          Yaz...?

          And he FINDS IT!

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Here we go...

          Jay opens the YAZ INCIDENT REPORT

                         INSIDE:

          - Pictures of Yaz

          - A type-written report telling us YAZ APPREHENDED BY AGENT

          KAY... JULY 16, 1969

          - Farther down on the page, a CASUALTY REPORT: ONE

          CASUALTY... HUMAN DEAD AT THE SCENE...

          ZED (O.S.)

          Ready to bring the pain?

          Reveal Zed in his ridiculous bowling outfit.

          BOWLING ALLEY - LATER THAT NIGHT

          A sign says: CLOSED FOR LEAGUE NIGHT

          We follow a couple normal-looking BOWLERS into

          INT. BOWLING ALLEY

          Safely inside, the Bowlers remove their heads -- which become

          their bowling balls.

          It's the LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME -- ALIENS VS. MIB AGENTS

          MiB agents and aliens say hi, exchange trash-talk.

          We see shots of games in progress:

          An alien rolls a ball -- when it gets to the end of the lane,

          it sticks out arms, taking down all the pins.

          17.

          The aliens cheer, slap tentacles, clink beers and swallow

          them whole. A many-armed alien re-sets the pins.

          A giant alien with perfect dainty form approaches the foul

          line... and -- gutter ball! He gets mad and shoots the pins

          with his laser-eyes.

          We end up with JAY AND THE MIB TEAM, NOT BOWLING BECAUSE

          THEY'RE WAITING FOR KAY --

          Zed paces, wearing way too much bowling regalia.

                         ZED

          Where's Kay? We either roll or

          forfeit -- and I didn't put this on

          to forfeit!

                         JAY

          Alright, Bowling Robot, do what we

          built you for.

          Reveal an incredibly high-tech robot wearing one of those

          white trash T-shirts that reads "10 reasons why Bowling is

          better than Women."

                         ROBOT

                         (ROBOT VOICE)

          This is my time to shine.

          Robot fires a ball directly down into the floor. An awkward

          beat as we hear the ball puncture four floors. Then a car

          alarm.

                         ROBOT (CONT'D)

          There goes my perfect game.

                         (ROBOT LAUGH)

          Ha ha ha.

                         JAY

          Guess it's on me.

          Jay rolls -- perfect spin -- Jay watches, willing it towards

          the pins -- which SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE WAY! But Jay's roll is

          too good -- it spins from fleeing pin to fleeing pin -- a

          STRIKE!

          Jay and his teammates triumphant! The frame of a lifetime!

          Jay looks around --

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Of course -- the one time Kay isn't

          here...

          18.

          MIB HQ - TUNNEL VENT ROOM

          Jay enters -- looks a little worse for wear, like somebody

          who did some celebrating last night.

          We see why -- when he hoists his GIANT, RIDICULOUS MIB

          BOWLING TROPHY.

                         JAY

          Check it out--

          The trophy raises a triumphant fist -- we realize it is in

          fact AN ALIEN.

                         TROPHY

          We're number one! In your face!

          Suck it!

                         JAY

          Look who's league MVP.

                         GUARD

          Big surprise, you win every year.

          That's weird...

                         JAY

          I... huh?

          MIB HQ - HEADQUARTERS

          Jay, in a good mood, flaunts his trophy to everyone in the

          office. The trophy continues its stream of obnoxious trash

          talk.

                         JAY

          Where are you, Kay? I think you

          want to see this. It's the bowling

          MVP trophy with MY name on it.

          Jay works his way to his desk.

          Kay's already at his own adjacent desk -- bent over his work,

          his back to Jay.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Maybe you want to think twice next

          time you ditch me.

          Kay, absorbed in work, doesn't answer.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Kay?

          19.

          KAY (O.S.)

          (back still to camera)

          Yeah?

                         JAY

          Yeah, I just wanted to show you

          this so I could say--

                         (SEEING HIM)

          Who the hell are YOU???

          Reveal -- CLINT EASTWOOD

          I'm agent Kay.

                         JAY

          You new around here?

                         " KAY"

                         (LAUGHS)

          Good one, partner.

                         JAY

          Yeah, okay, but I need the other

          Kay. You know, craggy old white

          guy... well, DIFFERENT craggy old

          white guy.

          I got you something.

          He hands over a "World's Best Partner" mug --

                         "KAY" (CONT'D)

          Have I told you today how much I

          appreciate working together?

                         JAY

          What the HELL is going on here?

          Why are you pretending to be Kay?

                         " KAY FR

          You seem upset. Let's go get some

          coffee and talk about our feelings.

                         JAY

          How about instead, you go find me

          THIS guy?

          Jay opens the YAZ file and pulls out a picture of KAY. But

          now, splashed across Kay's photo, the words:

          KILLED IN ACTION -- JULY 16, 1969

          20.

          Jay stares at the photo --- in it, we notice Kay is NOW

          WEARING A STRANGE MEDALLION

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Killed? In 1969?

          Jay grabs the YAZ FILE -- the one he looked through last

          night -- but now everything is different.

          We see -- the incident report stating ONE CASUALTY - AGENT

          KAY, DEAD AT SCENE...

          Jay can't believe it, he keeps reading...

          Snatches of the typewritten incident report

          The casualty report

          ONE CASUALTY... AGENT KAY, DEAD AT SCENE...

          A photo of Kay WEARING A STRANGE MEDALLION.

          Jay stares, struck by this --

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Kay's dead? How? Why?

          The Men in Black Computer/Big Board sounds the alarm!

          Attention. Inbound missiles

          Zed enters, chuckling at the warning:

          Well, must be a Tuesday. Okay,

          good ride.

          A GENERAL FREAK-OUT ENSUES

          Jay remains calm:

                         JAY

          Whoa, what's everyone freaking out

          about? We had one of these last

          week.

          "Kay" hides under a desk, weeping.

                         "KAY"

          We're all gonna die!

                         JAY

          Wait - what is everyone's problem?

          What about that pan-galactic

          missile shield thing?

                         ZED

          Sure, great idea, if we had one.

          saved. With shield...

          (shows Earth saved)

          without shield...

          (shows Earth destroyed)

          Sorry to say I told you so.

                         ZED

          I wanted to build one years ago,

          but Kay talked me out of it.

                         JAY

          Kay talked you out of it? Kay

          wouldn't do that. He's the most

          distrustful person in the galaxy.

          He personally set up that system to

          defend our planet from the scum of

          the universe.

          22.

                         " KAYAZ

          I thought we didn't have any

          enemies anymore. A stranger's just

          a friend you haven't met.

                         JAY

          Yeah, that's working out great.

          Look, I don't know what's frying

          everyone's brains, but I remember

          the missile shield --- Kay -- the

          real Kay -- loved that thing. He

          wouldn't shut up about it. I mean,

          that thing was all Kay.

                         (REALIZING)

          But Kay's dead. He's been dead for

          years. But I knew him yesterday.

           Jay looks at the YAZ file. Gears turning. He grabs a

          picture of Yaz --

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Where the hell did he.get an iPhone

          in 1969?

          EXTREME CLOSE UP ON PICTURE --

          Peeking out of Yaz's jacket -- an iPhone.

          Something clicks --

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         (REMEMBERING)

          Kay said Yaz can get you anywhere,

          anytime. Any TIME. So Yaz killed

          Kay in 1969 and now there's no

          missile shield.

          Jay realizes something and RUNS OFF

                         OKAY"

          I love you, Jay!

                         JAY

          You're definitely not Kay!

          JAY RUNS THROUGH MIB

          He runs by people dealing with the world coming to an end:

          COMPUTER (V.0.)

          Nine minutes to impact. I always

          loved you, microwave...

          23.

          On the microwave -- it beeps plaintively.

          Jay runs off with purpose...

          STREETS OF NYC

          July in the city. A perfect summer day. Kids eat ice cream.

          Old ladies head to matinees. The streets of New York team

          with humanity, blissfully unaware that they are about to die.

          In other words, a Tuesday.

          Jay runs through Time Square, where guys sell stuff on

          blankets.

          Desperately looking for someone...

          Among the sellers, a suspicious-looking guy wearing a strange

          mixture of anachronistic clothing -- tri-cornered hat.

          As soon as he sees Jay, his eyes go wide and HE FLEES.

          Jay grabs something off the blanket and smacks him -- lays

          him out.

                         JAY

          Where you going in such a hurry,

          Obadiah? The past?

                         OBADIAH

          What are you talking about?

          He throws his arms up, revealing a pocket watch and a

          telescope.

                         JAY

          I know you've been time-travelling.

                         OBADIAH

          No way, man. I've just been here,

          totally legit, here in New

          Amsterdam. I mean -- Manahatta ... n

          I'm legit.

                         JAY

          Yeah? What's this?

          Reveal the thing he just hit him with -- a ship's bell with

          S.S. TITANIC on it.

                         OBADIAH

          I swear, I'm out of that. That's

          my grandmother's.

          24.

                         JAY

          What else you got here?

                         OBADIAH

          Nothing, nothing man.

                         JAY

          Oh, yeah?

          Off a Dodo in a cage.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Is that a dodo bird?

                         OBADIAH

          Family pet.

                         JAY

          I think he'd be happier free.

          Jay frees the bird -- it runs, squawking...

                         OBADIAH

          Oh, come on, man!

                         JAY

          Interesting.

          Jay picks up Spider-Man 8 off the blanket. Featuring

          chubby, bald 50-year-old Tobey Maguire.

                         OBADIAH

          That's pirated, man. That ain't

          nothing.

          Jay rips open his jacket --

                         JAY

          And this?

          Reveal a copy of the Declaration of Independence..

                         OBADIAH

          Okay, okay, maybe I've been time

          travelling a little -- just for

          personal use, man, just enough to

                         GET BY--

                         JAY

          Listen -- I'll look the other way

          if you tell me who's selling time

          travel these days. I just want

          your supplier.

          25.

                         OBADIAH

          No way, man. You don't mess with

          that guy. He'll kill you, me, and

          then he'll go after our families!

                         JAY

          Don't worry, he won't have time.

                         OBADIAH

          What do you mean?

          Jay forces the guy to look up-- we see the missiles.

                         JAY

          Those hit the sun in 8 minutes.

          You want to live out those minutes?

          Or you want me to take you out of

          your misery?

          Jay picks up an ancient weapon -- crossbow, blunderbuss --

          off the blanket and puts it to the criminal's head.

                         OBADIAH

          Okay, okay, but don't say I didn't

          warn you, man. You just signed

          your own death warrant.

                         JAY

          I just want a name.

                         OBADIAH

          Fine, but it's the last one you'll

          ever hear.

                         CUT TO:

          CLOSE ON THE MOST NON-THREATENING FACE EVER

          Think Michael Cera at his most geeky.

                         CERA

          Hi, I'm Trevor!

          Reveal -- we are in

                         APPLE STORE

          And Trevor is an "Apple Genius"

                         TREVOR

          Do you have an appointment?

          26.

                         JAY

                         NO---

                         TREVOR

                         (CHIPPER)

          Well, if you don't have an

          appointment, you'll have to come

          back tomorrow.

                         JAY

          Yeah, well, the thing about

          tomorrow is, we'll all be busy

          being dead.

                         TREVOR

          Excuse me?

                         JAY

          Help me, or the world is gonna end.

                         TREVOR

          Everyone thinks their computer

          problem is the world coming to an

          end.

                         JAY

          Right. Take a look at this.

          Jay directs Cera's sightline to the sky--

                         TREVOR

          Ahhh! What is THAT?

                         JAY

          That, is We're all dead in... Seven

                         MINUTES UNLESS---

                         TREVOR

          Unless WHAT??

                         JAY

          You start sharing the illegal time

          travel tech you've been slinging.

                         NERD

          Excuse me, can you tell me which

          one of these batteries is better?

          The 10-hour or the 12--

                         JAY

          You only need seven minutes, get

          the cheap one.

          He grabs Trevor-

          27.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Where is it??

                         TREVOR

          Okay, okay, I'll show you. But

          this is incredibly powerful

          technology, so it must remain

          absolutely secret. Follow me.

          Trevor LEAVES HIS POST --- Jay follows:

                         TREVOR (CONT'D)

          Absolutely secret, do you

          understand?

                         JAY

          Yes, but we're running out of time--

          AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM

          Hey! Excuse me!

                         TREVOR

          With you in a second, ma'am.

          AFFLUENT WESTSIDE MOM

          It'll only take a minute. You see,

          my nanny's phone number got erased

          from my favorites and I have to ask

          her what my daughter wants for her

          birthday.

          Jay takes the phone.

                         JAY

          Oh, I see the problem.

          He CHUCKS THE PHONE across the store, where it SMASHES TO

          PIECES. She leaves in a huff.

                         TREVOR

          I've always wanted to do that.

          okay, so here's what you do...

          Trevor pulls Jay in, ready to lay this top secret information

          on him...

                         TREVOR (CONT'D)

          Okay, so go to the clock app. And

          shake it.

                         JAY

          That's it?

          Jay does it.

          28.

          On the phone -- TIME TRAVEL BETA

                         TREVOR

          Now you just type in the year you

          want to travel to...

          On the phone -- it's "augmented reality" -- the image through

          the phone is the image of the targeted time period.

                         JAY

          Okay, thanks.

                         TREVOR

          Now listen. This is highly

          crucial: Time travel is nothing to

          mess with. You can't change

          anything, you can't use new

          technology or all of space-time can

          just -- kablooey!

                         JAY

                         (OFF MISSILES)

          Yeah, well, is it ok if I change

          THAT?

                         TREVOR

          Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's cool.

          Jay is about to "enter" time travel...

                         TREVOR (CONT'D)

          Wait -- hold on a second. If you

          go -- I'm just gonna stay... and be

          dead?

                         JAY

          Don't worry, I'll fix it. You'll

          only be dead for a little while.

          Jay DISSOLVES INTO A TIME TRAVEL EFFECT...

          Cera is left alone. The missiles get EVER CLOSER...

          Trevor opens a "Voice Recorder" app:

                         TREVOR

                         (INTO PHONE)

          Trevor's last words. Dear

          posterity... Should anyone find

          this, let history remember that

          Trevor was a man of noble bearing,

          quiet dignity --

          (IMPACT!)

                         OH FUUUUUU-----

          29.

          And the world is vapor.

          EVERYTHING GOES WHITE...

                         WHITE

          Pure white.

          Jay comes to, groggy, like he has the worst hangover of all

          time, brain bigger than his skull, trying to make his eyes

          focus.

          Trying to make sense of his strange blinding white

          environment -- Is this the afterlife?

          The reverie disrupted by a TOILET FLUSH

          The white resolves into

          INT. BATHROOM

          Jay realizes he's in a men's room, sitting in a urinal. The

          music transitions: Whatever hip-hop featuring a 60s sample

          was playing in the Apple store -- now continues as the 60s

          song itself, played over a tinny portable radio.

          He hops up just as a young white office worker comes out of

          one of the stalls, washes his hands... and flips Jay a

          quarter.

          Jay stares at it a beat, confused. Misreading his confusion,

          the office worker awkwardly digs out another quarter.

                         OFFICE WORKER

          What the heck, you're doing a great

          job.

          The kid leaves.

          Jay ventures out of the bathroom and finds himself in...

          INT. HIGH 60'S OFFICE

          White guys on IBM Selectric typewriters as far as the eye can

          see -- like the office in the Apartment.

          Jay stops in his tracks, taking in the 1969-ness of it all.

          An officious guy, annoyed, runs up--

          30.

                         OFFICIOUS GUY

          You're late! Where's Mr. Watkins'

          lunch?

                         JAY

                         OH--

                         OFFICIOUS GUY

          Did his girl not put in the order?

          The officious guy glares at the "girl" -- in her 60s.

          OFFICIOUS GUY (CONT'D)

          (shoves a bill in Jay's

                         HAND)

          Run down to Woolworth's -- Two

          hamburger sandwiches, fries, egg

          cream, and a pack of luckies. If

          you're back in half an hour, you

          can keep the change.

          Jay looks at the SINGLE DOLLAR BILL.

          OFFICIOUS GUY (CONT'D)

          On the double, OK?

                         JAY

          Yeah.

          Jay's moves to the elevator, waits for it. Pockets the

          profits of the racist misunderstandings.

          Elevator opens, the elevator operator opens the door -- Jay

          climbs in with a car full of older executives.

          Jay shakes his head, just taking this all in.

                          JAY (CONT'D)

          Wow. 1969. You're all dead now.

          Just as the elevator's about to close, a leggy blonde tosses

          him a set of keys.

                         BLONDE

          The Big Man wants his caddy. Chop-

          chop.

          The doors close.

          31.

          EXT. PARKING LOT NEXT DOOR

          Jay's got the keys. He looks at the parking tag, walks down

          a row of beautiful classic cars, looking for the right car --

          stops and smiles.

          THE BIG MAN'S CADDY - JAY DRIVING

          Reveal Jay cruising in the most gorgeous 1964 Coupe deVille

          convertible. Fins, chrome, a thing of beauty.

          From the seat next to him -- a fedora. He puts it on,

          completing the look.

          In the background we notice the Leggy Blond getting yelled at

          by the guy who must be "The Big Man" Jay HONKS and waves --

          thank you!

          Jay finds some classic 60s music and enjoys himself for a

          minute -- a sweet ride through 60s New York.

          A GREAT 1969 HIT -- THE TEMPTATIONS' "Can't Get Next to You"

          comes on the radio. Jay is swept up in the music and soon is

          SINGING ALONG AT FULL BLAST.

          At a light, he pulls even with an older Brooklyn Italian

          couple. They give him a disapproving look. The woman

          clutches her pearls just a little more protectively.

          He smiles and leans towards them.

                         JAY

          Guess what? Black president!

          He laughs and drives off.

          Pulls up at...

          EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING

          The secret entrance to MiB HQ, familiar from the first movie.

          Jay strides up to the entrance and... can't open the door.

          Bangs on the door -- nothing. Shaking the knob, calling to

          the guard... nothing. From behind him:

          VOICE (O.S.)

          Help you? Look a little lost.

                         JAY

          Yeah, thanks, listen--

          32.

          Jay turns and is face-to-face with two grinning Staten Island

          cops. He instantly realizes what's about to go down.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         (SIGHS)

          Yeah, guess I knew this wasn't

          gonna be just people handing me

          money and Cadillacs.

                         COP 1

          'Scuse me?

                         JAY

          Nothing, officer. I'll be on my

          way.

                         COP 2

          That's an awful nice car.

                         JAY

          Thanks.

                         COP 1

          Kind of work you do, individual of

          your particular... ethnic

          persuasion... to buy a car like

          that?

                         COP 2

          Wouldn't be anything illegal, would

          it?

                         COP 1

          You an athlete or something?

                         JAY

          Yeah, I'm the North American

          champion of kiss my ass.

          The cop loses his smile, turns to his partner:

                         COP 1

          That sound like resisting arrest to

          you?

                         COP 2

          Sure did.

          They grab him, start to frisk him --

                         COP 2 (CONT'D)

          Well, well. Boy, you're gonna have

          a little problem explaining THIS.

          33.

          The cop holds up Jay's HIGH-TECH GUN -- the NOISY CRICKET

          and his NEURALIZER.

          A BLACK CROWN VIC SCREECHES UP between the cops and JAY.

          Out steps KAY -- but 40+ years younger.

                         KAY

          (flashes a badge)

          I'll take it from here.

                         COP

          Who the hell are you?

                         KAY

          Agent Kay, Division 2, special...

          (gives Jay a look)

          .black ops. Thank you for your

          cooperation, if I could ask you to

          look here for a moment --

          Kay pulls out what looks like a NEURALIZER -- and swiftly

          beats each one over the head -- it's just a BLACKJACK -- they

          crumple.

                         JAY

          Kay? Kay, is that you? Oh, man

          it's good to see you, buddy!

          Jay hugs Kay -- who remains stony-faced. Jay gets a little

          choked up to see his friend alive -- Kay is a rock.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Look at you, all... sort-of-

          young... Kay!

                         KAY

          That's got to be the first time an

          unregistered alien caught sneaking

          onto Earth was happy to see me.

          Jay pulls away, realizing--

                         JAY

          Oh! You think -- aw,that's funny.

          No, it's not like that. You see,

          I'm your partner.

                         KAY

          If I had a partner I'd know it.

                         JAY

          There's a simple explanation for

          that.

          34.

                         KAY

          I'm all ears.

                         JAY

          You see I'm your partner...

          (knows he's about to sound

                         CRAZY)

          In the future. And I came back to

          save you.

          A longdry stare.

                         KAY

          Well, thank you very much.

                         JAY -

          Hey, no problem, man. I got you--

                         KAY

          Yeah, thought I'd heard them all.

          Usually, they offer a great gift to

          the people of Earth in exchange for

          refuge. Time-travelling partner

          from the future -- that's some

          extra-credit right there, and I do

          appreciate you bringing some much-

          needed variety to what can be a

          very dull job. But I'm still gonna

          have to bring you in.

                         JAY

          Yeah, ok, I know it sounds a little-

                         KAY

          It sounds a LOT--

                         JAY

          That's why I'm going to prove it to

          you... Because if I weren't from

          the future, would I know about --

          your little top-secret headquarters

          right HERE??

          He tries to force the door open. Nothing.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          I said -- HERE?

          (tries - nothing)

          HERE??!?

          Jay finally kicks the door open --

          And inside... we SEE...

          35.

          An abandoned building, filled with spiders, etc.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Right. Not here yet. But it will

          be. Gonna need to get rid of the

          raccoons and bats and stuff, but...

          it'll be real nice. Game room over

          there for your pinball, you love

          your pinball. Lotta good times

          there -- I'm going for an extra

          ball, Jay! you'd say. And I'd be

          there. With you. Partners.

          Long stare from Kay.

                         KAY

          Let's go. And word of advice -= I

          don't know what it's like on your

          planet, but around here, a guy with

          your... complexion in a car like

          that is gonna get some attention he

          doesn't want.

          EXT. NEW JERSEY STATE PARKWAY

          We hear the way-too-loud death-rattle exhaust note of what

          sounds like ten Harleys at once.

          Reveal -- Yaz, the nightmare biker, looking like Dennis

          Hopper meets Satan, riding a badass custom skull-themed rig

          that might have dropped out of the brain of Stanley Mouse.

          His skull ring gleams on his pinkie. Devil Girl sits behind

          him, hands on his shoulders.

          We ride with them a beat, tearing down the highway...

          They STOP AT A LIGHT -- even with a brightly-painted microbus

          full of hippies.

          One of the hippies leans out --

                         HIPPIE

          Hey, you guys like to party? Care

          to make a trade for the mama?

          Yaz pulls out his alien "guns." The stoned hippie smiles

          serenely and puts a flower in one of the mouths. Makes a

          peace sign.

                         HIPPIE (CONT'D)

          Make love, not war.

          36.

          Yaz "fires" the alien -- it launches into the microbus --

          followed by its brother.

          The microbus rocks, hippies scream, the bus dents from the

          inside-out. On a bumper sticker: If This Van's a-rockin',

          don't come a knockin'.

          The guns, finished, return to Yaz.

          Yaz surveys the carnage, picks up a medallion off one of the

          hippies. But looking at it more closely, frowns and throws

          it away.

          The head back on their way... Blood drips over the Ass, Gas

          or Grass bumper sticker...

          We dissolve from the blood to a deep red STRAWBERRY SUNDAE.

          Widen to reveal we are in...

          INT. HORN AND HARDART'S

          A great NYC automat...

          The kind of place you go when you like to be alone.

          Loners and weirdos populate the tables, minding their own

          business. Immigrants read foreign papers.

          Jay follows Kay as they walk by the glorious deco machines

          offering pies... pastries.., beverages...

                         JAY

          Is this your favorite place? Makes.

          sense. Zero human interaction.

          Kay ignores him.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          So how old are you?

                         KAY

          Twenty-six.

                         JAY

          Really? Wow, you got some city

          miles on you.

          Jay laughs. Kay ignores him, stops in front of a machine

          offering "SPECIALS".

          Jay grabs a paper off a nearby table: We see headlines about

          Nixon, Vietnam, the Apollo Launch.

          37.

          Jay looks at the date: July 14, 1969.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          The fourteenth. Then we have two

          days.

          Kay really takes his time, picking out the right sandwich.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Hey, look, I know your lunch is

          important, but like I said, we only

          have two days here.

                         KAY

          Here we go...

          Kay puts some money in the machine -- is about to make his

          selection. Jay reacts to it -- GROSS!

          We see -- the most unappealing ham sandwich ever. The meat

          is tinged with green and beginning to get a little fuzzy. No

          one in their right mind would buy this sandwich.

                         JAY

          No way, man. I am not letting you

          eat that. I didn't come all the

          way here to have you die before I

          can tell you--

          Kay reaches for the button. Jay slaps his hand away.

          A BEAT of undignified hand-slap-fighting--

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          No way, man. No way the world ends

          because you had to eat that thing--

          Kay SUCCEEDS IN HITTING THE BUTTON and

                         FWOOOOOOPI

          A SECRET DOOR instantly spins them around and Jay and Kay are

          INT. MIB 1969 HQ

          A cloud of smoke... It clears and reveals

          Mid-century futurism with a martini lunch office vibe. It's

          how Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury would have imagined the MiB

          offices.

          38.

          The cloud of smoke comes from everyone smoking. Aliens run

          around with ashtrays, cocktail shakers and cigarettes. The

          alien smokers smoke from surprising orifices.

          The !liB agents have the feel of ivy league privilege. Very

          male and very white. Women are there to be secretaries and

          eye candy.

          Two many-armed aliens stock the automat. Kay tosses one the

          sandwich, it goes right back into the automat.

          Jay recognizes the aliens -- it's the twins!

                         JAY

          Hey! [long alien name] and Bob!

           Don't worry, you guys get a big

          promotion in, like, 20 years.

          Kay takes Jay down an escalator. Quick atmospheric

          establishing shots of MiB '69:

          - A wall of Black and White TVs monitoring the aliens of the

          times: Castro... Yoko... Hendrix...

          - A cluster of agents use a joystick to manipulate a very

          high-tech camera. Reveal they're using it to watch a

          secretary's ass. She gets wise, turns -- they raise their

          martinis and she giggles at them: You're incorrigible!

          - Aliens work switchboards, work in the steno pool.

          - Someone barks at an alien to grab a couple Mooners and go

          clean something up.

          - An MiB barbershop quartet practices.

                         MIB QUARTET

          Jay can't help laughing --

                         JAY

          What planet are they from?

                         KAY

          The Hamptons. Let's go somewhere

          we can talk.

          INT. HOLDING ROOM

          Typical interrogation room table in the middle.

          Kay pulls out a giant form -- it looks like 10 tax returns

          stacked together. He fits sheets of carbon between the

          pages.

                         JAY

          Oh, we're gonna do the forms now.

          Listen, Kay, I know you're gonna do

          what you're gonna do, but we're

          burning time here. When I got

          here, you had 48 hours. Now you've

          got 46.

          Kay looks at the form, there's a number of options to check:

          "Create a new race... Steal Earth women... Offer life of

          eternal youth... vacation... Save the Earth." He checks the

          There's a killer out there. Goes

          by "Yaz." He's coming for you.

          You told me your one regret was not

          killing him when you had the

          Never heard of any Yaz.

                         JAY

          You will. Here's what to look for.

          Long hair, leather, looks kind of

          like a biker. You'll know him from

          the skull ring on his pinky. He's

          trying to blow up the Earth and you

          get in his way somehow so he kills

          you. This Friday. In Florida.

          So, if you want to live -- do not

          go to Florida.

                         KAY

          Florida? I hate Florida. I hate

          everything South of Virginia. If

          that's what you came to tell me,

          you're wasting your time.

                         JAY

          Man, you're as stubborn as you

          always were. I mean -- always will

          be. Look, It's not just about you.

          Because he kills you, you don't

          live long enough to build the

          defense shield. And without a

          defense shield, the Earth gets

          destroyed. You get it? He kills

          you, the Earth gets destroyed. I

          have to save you from him so we can

          save the planet.

          Kay stops writing.

                         KAY

          Huh. Well. This is finally

          starting to make sense.

                         EX

          Fortunately, we have the technology

          here to test for that.

          Ex steps up close to Jay. Looks him over. Then SWIFTLY

          PUNCHES HIM IN THE STOMACH.

                         EX (CONT'D)

          Gag reflex. Coughing. Eyes

          watering. Human. Code 43 him.

                         KAY

          Got it, chief.

                         THROUGH MIB

          Kay walks Jay.

                         JAY

          So what's code 43?

          They pass through a set of double doors. Tilt up to reveal:

                         ROOM 43

          42.

          ON JAY AND KAY

          Jay reacts to whatever he's looking at.

                         JAY

                         WHAT THE--

                         KAY

          This little baby here is called a

          Neuralizer.

          REVEAL -- The 1969 Neuralizer fills an entire room. And we

                         ARE

          INT. ROOM 43 -- NEURALIZER ROOM

          It's manned by 60s labcoat technicians with sliderules and

          punchcards.

          The Neuralizer itself is a piece of 60s-tech-glory --

          magnets, tubes, things that look like they belong in Dr.

          Frankenstein's lab.

                         JAY

          Whoa, whoa, what? You're gonna

          neuralize ME? You can't neuralize

          me. Haven't you been listening?

          Two ALIEN ORDERLIES grab Jay.

                         KAY

          Have a lay down, stretch.

          The orderlies force Jay on a sort of gurney -- in the '69

          Neuralizer, the "patient" is fed through the machine, like

          for an MRI.

                         JAY

          You erase what's in here, you erase

          the whole world.

                         KAY

          Don't worry. When it's over,

          you'll forget all about this Yaz

          and Florida and the end of the

          world. I think it'll be good for

          you. Calm you down.

                         JAY

          I don't need to calm down.

          43.

                         KAY

          Don't worry, it's safe. We even

          tested it on one of our own men.

          Kay indicates Q, who wanders around like he's been

          lobotomized.

                         KAY (CONT'D)

          Hey, Agent Q!

          Q waves back:

          Hey, agent Q!

                         KAY

          No, YOU'RE -- forget it.

          (back to Jay)

          We're still.., fine-tuning it.

          okay, strap him down.

          TWO BIG-ASS ALIEN ORDERLIES force Jay down.

          A TECH flips the machine ON -- TUBES POWER UP WITH HUGE NOISE

          AND FANFARE.

          Jay struggles as he gets closer and closer to the machine.

          Jay manages to slide his key fob out of his'pocket -- uses

          the edge to flip open the clamp on the straps -- and HE'S

                         FREE

                         TECH

          How the hell--

          Kay smiles -- Not bad, kid.

          The orderlies rush him -- Jay knocks them out. The

          scientists are fraidy-cats -- they hide.

          It's down to Jay and Kay.

                         KAY

          Nice moves. You'd make a good

          agent.

                         JAY

          I AM a good agent!

          Kay takes a SWING at Jay -- Jay dodges it easily.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          That's right, you always lead with

          your left.

          44.

          Kay pulls his weapon -- Jay ducks behind the Neuralizer --

          now Kay can't shoot.

                         KAY

          You're just making it worse for

          yourself.

          The following plays over a game of CAT AND MOUSE around the

          giant structure of the Neuralizer -- like through the stacks

          in a library.

                         KAY (CONT'D)

          There's nowhere to run, slim. It's

          just if we're gonna do it easy or

          do it hard.

          Jay runs into a dead end.

          Kay and the orderlies are on him. The pissed-off orderlies

          grab him roughly, force him onto the gurney. Jay keeps

          flailing.

                         JAY

          I know you, Kay, I can prove it...

                         (SEARCHES)

          You love to bowl!

                         KAY

          Bowling is enjoyed by more than 95

          million people in more than 90

          countries. You gotta do better

          than that.

                         JAY

          You've got a scar on the back of

          your right hand!

          Jay grabs Kay's hand. They LOCK EYES for a moment. Kay lets

          Jay flip his hand over, big build-up, REVEALING...

          .no scar.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Damn. You will! I swear!

          Kay signals -- the Neuralizer powers up.

          And Jay is on the conveyor belt into the machine. This is

          all about to be over. Jay thinks desperately for a way out,

          THEN-- Eureka!!

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Kay! KAY!!! What about your girl

          on Martha's Vineyard?

          45.

          Kay looks up. Jay sees an opening:

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          You chose the job over her -- but

          you never stopped thinking about

          her. You can't forget her.

          Kay grabs him.

                         KAY

          How the hell do you know that?

          I've never told anyone that.

          A long look at this guy, who somehow knows things he

          shouldn't.

          And he hits the POWER OFF BUTTON...

          But this being TUBE TECHNOLOGY -- we stay with JAY'S

          TERRIFYING POV -- as he slides through the claustrophobic

          Neuralizer chamber -- the tubes powering down just in time,

          inches away from him.

          Jay crawls out of the Neuralizer, shaken.

                         JAY

          You see, Kay? It's me--

          But Kay grabs him and puts a gun on him--

                         KAY

          If you're gonna drag her into this,

          you'd better be able to back up

          your story. Because if you're

          jerking me around, I'll make a

          window out of your head.

                         JAY

          Yeah, okay, um -- according to the

          file, he should have entered Earth-

          space in the last couple days. Did

          you spot any unauthorized landings

          in the last 48 hours?

          Kay looks to a tech, who looks at a clipboard --

                         TECH

          We did have something -- a landing

          in New Jersey.

          Kay and Jay look at each other.

          46.

                         KAY

                         (TO JAY)

          Alright, you're coming with me.

          Jay grabs his key chain.

                         JAY

          Can I ask how you're planning on

          getting me out of here?

          INT. MIB 1969 HQ

           Kay leads a "LOBOTOMIZED" Jay through HQ.

                          KAY

           'Scuse me, boys. Just did a code

           43 on this one.

                         JAY

          How's it going, fellas? Look, I

          put on my pants.

          He feels one of the agent's faces.

          Kay leads him to the exit. He talks to Jay as if Jay is a

          dim 3rd-grader who speaks little English:

                         KAY

          You are a tourist from Kansas. A

          city slicker took your wallet at

          the bus station...

          Kay leads Jay to a SET OF DOORS MARKED "EXIT to STREET" --

          MANNED BY MIB AGENTS.

                         KAY (CONT'D)

          Two out.

          The agents nod to Kay and WAVE HIM THROUGH-THE EXIT...

          Which deposits them in...

          INT. SHOWWORLD CENTER

          The peepshow megaplex from the bad old days of time square.

          A creepy pervert sits in a booth. Puts money into the

          The wall SLIDES UP -- and to his surprise, instead of a

          peepshow...

          47.

          Jay and Kay climb out. Off the creep's reaction:

                         JAY

          Aww. Did I spoil the mood?

          INT. CROWN VIC - KAY DRIVING

                         JAY

          Yeah, yeah. Window out of my head.

          But hey -- if I don't save you, I'm

          dead anyway. So do what you want

          to me -- just make sure you watch

          out for yourself.

          They pull up to...

          EXT. VINCENZI BROTHERS WASTE MANAGEMENT - OFFICES

          A squat shack on the edge of a dump, home office to a

          "legitimate local business."

          The windows are bloodied and broken from the inside.

          Corpses of wiseguys litter the front of the building, all

          showing disturbing spore growth. [please see

          http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuKjBIBBALS for reference]

          The corpses DEMATERIALIZE and disappear.

                         JAY

          This doesn't look like a mob hit.

                         KAY

          That's a hell of an observation.

          What gave it away?

                         JAY

          Spores. Dematerializing corpses.

          And THAT.

          Jay points beyond the building... a SHEER DROP

          Which is the edge of a HUGE SMOKING CRATER --

          And how did this crater get here?

          48.

          In the center, a GIANT ROCKET, all chrome and Flash Gordon.

          It formed the crater on landing.

                         KAY

          We're going in.

          Kay draws his weapon.

          Aren't you gonna give me a.gun?

                         KAY

          Right.

          He pulls out a Smith and Wesson, dumps the bullets, and hands

          it over.

                         KAY (CONT'D)

          Try not to get in my way.

                         JAY

          You try not to get in MY way.

          Jay and Kay move towards the building... BAM! BAM! BAM!!

          Someone's firing at them -- they dive for cover.

          More GUNSHOTS --

          Jay gives Kay THE SIGNAL, WE SAW IN THE CHINESE RESTAURANT

                         KAY

          What the hell is that?

                         JAY

          alive.

                         KAY

          The hell I will.

          Jay tries to go in -- Kay pushes him out of the way and goes

          in first.

                         VINCENZI BROTHERS

          Jay and Kay bust in -- almost fall into the room because

          they're squabbling over who's first --

          Then - BAM!

          49.

          Someone's hiding under a desk, holding a gun over his head,

          firing randomly.

          Kay gets GRAZED --

          They dive for cover. Kay's right hand is bleeding.

                         JAY

          Huh. So that's how you got the

          scar.

          Jay tosses his EMPTY GUN into the corner -- the guy under the

          desk fires FIVE TIMES - EMPTYING HIS GUN!

          Jay sprints at him, flips the table -- it's a terrified,

          quivering WISEGUY. Jay grabs him and DISARMS HIM.

          The guy is FREAKED OUT.

                         WISEGUY

          Now tell me everything you know

          about this Yaz scumbag.

                         JAY

          In two days he's gonna kill you in

          Florida.

                         KAY

          Two days. Doesn't give me a lot of

          time. You couldn't have come back

          a week ago?

          52.

                         JAY

          Sorry, I was distracted by the

          Earth blowing up.

                         KAY

          So we have two days to kill him

          before he kills me. Alright,

          there's one cesspool everyone

          washes up in sooner or later.

          Someone'll know something there.

          Come on. Let's take a drive to

          Alien Town.

                         JAY

          Alien Town?

          They drive under a sign indicating: EAST VILLAGE

                         WITH YAZ

          Cruising through NY. Devil Girl on the seat behind him. He

          pulls even with a patrol car.

                         YAZ

          Excuse me, officers of the law.

          Like you, I care a great deal. about

          justice and I'm looking for some

          people. Maybe you can help me.

                         OFFICER

          Okay -- get a shave and a haircut..

          They laugh.

          Yaz smiles sadly.

                         YAZ

          Have you ever lost someone close to

          you? I have. I've lost everyone.

          Everyone except them. Can you help

          me find them?

          He gives the cops a picture, they take it grudgingly -- we

          see it: a half dozen hippies wearing medallions.

          The cops look at each other and raise eyebrows.

                         OFFICER

          Only one part of town where people

          like that hang out...

          53.

          EXT. THE DECKER BUILDING

          The historic Village landmark.

          Jay and Kay approach... 60s freaks eyeball the squares...

          IN THE ELEVATOR

          Jay and Kay ride to the sixth floor.

                         JAY

          There's gotta be something that

          connects you to Yaz. What cases

          are you working on?

                         KAY

          Well, I'got this whole dry ice

          thing.

                         JAY

          Dry ice? What's that? Someone get

          killed over some dry ice?

          Smuggling something in some dry

          ice?

                         KAY

          No. We just can't figure out what

          it is.

                         JAY

          Wow, you're pretty low on the totem

          pole, aren't you? The great Kay,

          looking for dry ice.

                         KAY

          Don't push your luck.

          The doors open, and we're in...

          A WAY-OUT 60'S PARTY

          Kay's on the hunt for someone. They weave their way through

          the far-out types, hear snippets of high-60s party

          conversations.

          Someone notices Jay's suit --

                         PARTY SNOB

          What are you, a time traveller?

                         JAY REACTS--

          54.

          PARTY SNOB (CONT'D)

          That suit is SO five years ago.

          Kay sees who he's looking for, grabs him:

                         KAY

          We need to talk.

          Reveal ANDY WARHOL -- and this is the Factory, and this is

          one of Warhols' famous parties.

          Draped on Warhol -- a bunch of strange hangers-on, his

          "stars."

                         ULTRAVIOLET

          Yum, pigs are getting cute.

          Jay smiles -- she looks skeeved out.

                          ULTRAVIOLET (CONT'D)

          I meant the young one.

          Warhol speaks with his strange -- yes, almost alien --

          affect.

                         WARHOL

          It's not really a good time to

          talk. I'm creating a party.

          (sighs, totally put out)

          But... Maybe if he asks me.

                         JAY

          What - me?

                         WARHOL

          I would never say no to anything

          that came out of that beautiful

          mouth...

          Jay is visibly uncomfortable. Kay nudges Jay - do it.

                         JAY

          [Grumbles about what he has to do

          for his partner].

          (then, to Warhol)

          We need to talk. Please.

          Warhol and his Stars ooh and ahh over Jay. Someone snaps a

          picture.

                         WARHOL

          Amazing, just amazing. Alright,

          you talked me into it. Follow me.

                         (TO ENTOURAGE)

          Be back soon, stars.

          PRIVATE STUDIO LOFT

          From here, a window looks out over the whole scene.

          Warhol leads the guys in, shuts the door and LOCKS IT.

          Immediately, his ENTIRE AFFECT CHANGES -- he rips off his

          WIG, lights a cigarette, and talks like a hard-nosed cop.

                         WARHOL

          Damnit, Kay, are you TRYING to blow

          my cover?

                         KAY

          Take it easy agent W, your cover is

          perfectly safe.

                         WARHOL

          Perfectly safe? Are you out of

          your goddamned mind? It's only a

          matter of time before they figure

          out I'm a total fraud.

                         KAY

          Cool your jets--

                         WARHOL

          I'm so out of ideas I'm painting

          bananas and soup cans for

          chrissakes. How long do you really

          think they're gonna keep buying

          this shit?

          Warhol slumps on a chair.

                         WARHOL (CONT'D)

          I can't take it anymore. Talking

          to these nutjobs and all these

          goddamn hippies. God, I hate

          hippies. They're just filthy, Kay.

                         KAY

          Yeah, I know they are, buddy. But

          you're doing good work here. We

          need you.

          A knock at the door -- Warhol gets back into character --

          56.

                         WARHOL

          I'll be right there... I'm just...

          filming these men eating a

          hamburger... It's... transcendent.

          Okay, now the pickle...

          (back to cop form)

          You see what I mean? And who the

          hell's this guy? New partner?

                         JAY

          Actually, I'm his old partner. I

          came from the future to warn him

                         ABOUT--

                         WARHOL

          Jesus, fine, don't tell me.

          Alright, what do you need?

                         JAY

          We're looking for a recent arrival.

          Long hair, wears a lot of

          leather...

          Warhol indicates the party below -- half the guests match

          that description.

                         WARHOL

          You'll have to do better than that.

          Look, if that's all you have, I

          can't help you.

                         KAY

          Maybe you know someone who's seen

          something.

          STAR (O.S.)

          Andy, the horse is here...

                         WARHOL

          I gotta get back in there--

                         JAY

          Hold up -- the guy we're looking

          for -- he's out to destroy the

          world.

                         WARHOL

          C'mon, what's new? What does an

          MiE call it when someone tries to

          destroy the world? Tuesday.

                         JAY

          I thought you made that up.

          57.

                         KAY

          C'mon, W, I got a feeling on this

          one. Like we should take it

          serious. And we don't have much

          time.

          Jay checks his watch.

                         JAY

          33 hours.

                         WARHOL

          Yeah, yeah, alright.

                         (THINKS)

          Okay, talk to Prell and Vidal.

          C'mon.

          IN THE PARTY

          ON TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - in very 60s fashion with incredibly

          giant hair - one with a big afro, one with big chignon

          hairdo.

          WARHOL (O.S.)

          (back in "character")

          Vidal, Prell, can you please talk

          to these nice men?

          The women's LIPS DON'T MOVE -- they respond in incongruously

                         GRUFF VOICES:

                         PRELL

          Whadaya want?

                         VIDAL

          They look like cops to me.

          ain't talking.

                         PRELL

          We're not rats.

          We swing around them to REVEAL that Warhol/Kay/Jay are not

          talking to the women's faces --

          They're STANDING BEHIND THE WOMEN -- TALKING TO THEIR HAIR-

          DO'S which we realize are two COMPLETE HAIR ALIENS, VIDAL and

          PRELL, perched atop these women.

                         KAY

          Start talking, you two, before you

          end up on a barber's floor.

          58.

                         PRELL

          Ah, you don't scare me.

                         KAY

          Yeah?

          Kay reaches into a passing woman's purse, pulls out

          HAIRSPRAY. Grab some of Prell and holds up the spray.

                         PRELL

          You wouldn't!

          He sprays the hair, it starts to SCREAM IN PAIN.

                         VIDAL

          Stop, you bastard!

                         PRELL

          I'm telling you, we don't know

          anything!

                         KAY

          You wanna play tough? How about we

          take a ride to the barber college,

          see how tough you are?

          Kay keeps shaking them down, but Jay is distracted...

          On Jay... something is making him think...

          A sound... it. grows louder... we start to be able to make out

          the distinct bip... bip... bip... of PONG

          Jay FOLLOWS THE SOUND...

          To a group of people -- that incredible Factory mix from

          slumming socialites to Black Panthers to the freakiest

          freaks...

          They surround a SKANKY GUY -- and whatever they're watching

          on TV is so mesmerizing it's like they're seeing the face of

          God...

                         BROOKE ASTOR

          It's too beautiful.

          Someone takes a picture of the screen.

          Jay walks around the TV -- REVEAL:

          They're watching CLASSIC EARLY 70S PONG.

          59.

          The SKANKY GUY controls it via a BIG MEDALLION hooked up to

          the TV antennae terminals. He's playing against a young

          clean-cut square.

          Jay grabs the wires and rips them out, cutting off the game.

          Everyone JEERS him.

          ON KAY, hearing the noise, turns to see what's going on.

                         SKANKY GUY

          What the hell, man?

                         JAY

          Just wondering where you got that.

                         SKANKY GUY

          Your mother.

          The crowd laughs.

                         JAY

          Really. So my mother gave you a

          technology that hasn't been

          INVENTED FOR SEVEN YEARS?

          Jay grabs him by the throat.

          Partygoers react. Someone takes pictures. Someone claps in

          delight.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Now how about you tell me where you

          really got it?

          The skanky guy knows he's in trouble.

                         SKANKY GUY

          Oh... uh... okay, no hassles,

          man... I got it from that dude over

          there... With the beard.

          Jay turns, lets go just long enough for the guy to LEAP OUT

                         THE WINDOW

          Jay takes off after him -- Kay joins

          And the CHASE IS ON

          CHASE THROUGH THE VILLAGE

          Jay and Kay chase the guy through various 60s locations - a

          commune, an ashram, a folk club, a protest.

          60.

          Everywhere they are mistaken for "pigs" - people get in their

          way.

          To Jay's surprise, young Kay is a hell of a runner, in

          incredible shape. It gets competitive between them...

          Until Jay can't keep up -- Kay takes off...

          Kay runs the Skanky Guy down -

          Jay huffs and puffs his way over, grabs the medallion.

                         JAY

          Alright, one more time. Where'd

          you get this?

                         SKANKY GUY

          It was a gift--

                         JAY

          Bullshit.

          Kay puts a gun on him.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Oh, hey. This is my partner. He's

          about to get fired for excessive

          violence and he doesn't have much

          left to lose.

                         SKANKY GUY

          I borrowed it!

          CLICK! Kay cocks the gun.

          SKANKY GUY (CONT'D

          I stole it, okay?

                         JAY

          That's what I like. A nice, honest

          thief. Stole it from who?

                         SKANKY GUY

          They don't even care, man. They

          leave their money everywhere.

                         JAY

          Who?

                         SKANKY GUY

          I don't know who they are--

          61.

                         KAY

          Then you're not worth much to us,

          are you?

          The gun comes back out.

                         SKANKY GUY

          I heard they were Archanans.

                         JAY

          Archanans? They're pretty far out

          of their neighborhood. I didn't

          think we'd ever had one on Earth

          before.

                         SKANKY GUY

          I can tell you where they live!

          Southwest corner of 3rd and Avenue

          C. Top floor. Apartment 12.

          Jay rips the medallion off his neck.

          SKANKY GUY (CONT'D)

          Ow!

                         JAY

          I'll do a lot worse. Get the hell

          out of here.

          The guy runs off.

                         KAY

          What's the deal with the necklace?

                         JAY

          You were wearing one just like it

          when you died. Come on.

          SOUTHWEST CORNER OF 3RD AND AVENUE C

          Jay and Kay pull up in front of the building.

                         KAY

          That address. It's familiar.

          He pulls out a notebook.

                         KAY (CONT'D)

          I was going to come by here

          tomorrow to check out a lead on the

          62.

                         JAY

          So you come here tomorrow, get

          tangled up with these Archanans...

          And...

                         KAY

          And Yaz kills me?

                         JAY

          Something like that. So do me and

          the people of Earth a favor and be

          careful.

                         KAY

          Aw, put on your big girl panties

          and let's go.

                         JAY

          Hey, I've always got my big girl

          panties on.

          Huh. That didn't sound right.

          INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR

          Jay and Kay ride up...

                         KAY

          That thing back at the party, what

          was it? Some kind of game?

                         JAY

          Not just any game, PONG. Game of

          kings. But it wasn't invented

          until 1974.

                         KAY

          How do you know that?

                         JAY

          Because I was the only kid on my

          block who didn't have one.

                         KAY

          Aw, what's the matter? Daddy

          didn't buy you the toy you wanted?

                         JAY

          Didn't have a daddy to not buy me

          toys. Here's the only thing I ever

          got from him--

          He holds up his key chain.

          63.

                         KAY

          That's rough.

                         JAY

          It gets worse. You're the closest

          thing I have to a dad.

          DOORS OPEN...

          DOWN THE RATTY HALLWAY

          Jay and Kay move carefully, ready for trouble.

          They get to the door -- Apartment 12.

          Jay points to the door -- THIS IS IT!

          They see -- THE DOOR IS SMASHED IN, PUNCHED OFF ITS HINGES

          And punched into the door -- THE IMPRESSION OF A SKULL RING

                         JAY

          That's from Yaz's ring. He was

          here. Or is here.

          Jay SIGNALS KAY

                         KAY

          Why do you keep doing that?

          INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

          They move into the room on high alert...

          But it's empty.

          They realize the strangeness of the room - alien technology

          (including a TV hooked up to something strange with tons of

          wires hanging out) and lots of money.. LOTS of money...

          Not just piles -- the actual furniture is MADE OF STACKS OF

          MONEY. They've been using it for scrap paper, for napkins.

                         JAY

          So Yaz was never after you... he

          was after the Archanans. You just

          got in the way.

                         KAY

          Which must make them damn

          important. But what does he want

          with them?

          64.

                         JAY

          'No sign of struggle. They must've

          cleared out before he got here.

          Like they knew he was coming.

                         KAY

          And he's probably on their trail

          now. But where the hell did they

          go?

          They look around, puzzling over this place. Jay picks up a

          $100 bill off a table made out of stacks of money.

                         JAY

          Think this might tell us something?

          On the $100 bill:

           A strange series of words and numbers: 3 2... 5 1... 7 5..

                         KAY

          Looks like some kind of code.

          We'll take it to HQ, run it through

          the computer. Figure out where

          they went.

          BACK THROUGH THE HALLWAY

          Jay and Kay walk down the dark hallway --

          Yaz steps out of the shadows --

          BACK IN THE CAR

          Jay and Kay head back to HQ. Kay drives, Jay stares at the

          $100 bill, squinting at it, turning it over --

                         JAY

          How about bible verses?

          Coordinates? Airplane flights?

          Shoe sizes?

                         KAY

          So this is how you do it in the

          future, huh? You just keep

          guessing until you figure it out?

                         JAY

                         (EUREKA)

          Phone numbers!

          They stop at a light.

          65.

          Suddenly -- WHAM! WHAM! Someone FRANTICALLY POUNDS on the

          trunk -- a frightened 12-year-old prostitute wearing what is

          basically Jodi Foster's Taxi Driver hooker costume --

          hotpants, mary janes, halter top. There's something familiar

          about her face...

          HOT PANTS GIRL

          For God's sake! Help me, would

          you? There's some maniac after me -

                         JAY

          Slow down -- who's after you?

          HOT PANTS GIRL

          He was like nothing I ever saw --

          crazy eyes, and this freaky skull

          ring.

          Jay and Kay look at each other:

                         JAY

          Get in.

          HOT PANTS GIRL

          Thank you so much. This is a

          dangerous city for a girl.

          The light turns green -- we're on the girl's face. Jay and

          Kay looking straight ahead.

                         JAY

          So where can we take you?

          HOT PANTS GIRL

          Just make a left up here.

          Kay does it... There's a rushing noise...

          In the back seat, Hot Pants Girl IS "INFLATING" AND BECOMING

          DEVIL GIRL!

          The car turns down a dark, deserted alley.

                         JAY

          Are you sure? Seems dangerous.

                         DEVIL GIRL

          Not for me.

          Reveal -- the girl has fully "inflated" into her natural form

          -- DEVIL GIRL! The outfit is grotesque on her.

          DEVIL GIRL ATTACKS

          66.

          SET PIECE FIGHT in the car. Employing cool MiB tech built

          into the car.

          Devil Girl subdued, locked into the trunk in a "CONTAINMENT

          SACK" -- like what you'd use to stuff a raccoon into.

          The fight's over, the guys slump against the car.

                         JAY

          What the hell was that?

                         KAY

          I don't know, but I'd bet you two

          to one Yaz sent her.

          Beat. Light bulb moment for Jay --

                         JAY

          Say that again!

                         KAY

          I think Yaz sent her.

                         JAY

          No, the whole thing!

                         KAY

          I'd bet you two to one Yaz sent

          her.

          On Jay, realizing--

          He grabs the $100 bill --

                         JAY

          I know where they are!

          ON JAY AND KAY

          Walking -- we hear sounds of crowds, of cheering, REVEAL we

                         ARE AT--

          EXT. AQUEDUCT RACETRACK

                         JAY

          How are we going to find them? Any

          idea what an Archanan looks like?

          And then -- they see --

          AMID THE SEA OF GUYS IN SUITS, HATS, AND SKINNY TIES...

          67.

          A circle of what looks like Tibetan monks -- colorful,

          playful, dressed in robes.

          They could only be -- the Archanans.

          The group comprises one older Archanan -- the LAMA -- and

          three younger ATTENDANTS.

                         KAY

          I think I found them.

          They step into

          THE ARCHANANS' AURA

          Within the space around the Archanans, the chaos and noise of

          the crowd melts away. Deflected.

          There are three Archanans and one distinctive older one --

          THE LAMA.

          In the middle -- a giant pile of winnings.

          All is peaceful within this space. Faint chimes.

          They greet Jay and Kay happily, chant a strange mantra:

                         ARCHANANS

                         (CHANTING)

          King Lady Big Trouble Classy...

          The faint sound of an announcer:

          ANNOUNCER (V.0.)

          Results for the sixth race: King,

          Sweet Sophie, Big Trouble and Red

          Gent!

                         ARCHANANS

                         (CHANTING)

          Superba pays 3200 to one...

                         JAY

          You're in danger--

                         ARCHANANS

          You're in danger... you're in

          danger...

          Jay thinks they're playing the "echo game" like little kids:

                         JAY

          Very cute, but--

          68.

                         LAMA

          In eight seconds, please do us the

          kindness of ducking.

                         JAY

          Huh?

                         KAY

          Yaz!

          They turn to see YAZ -- he levels a WEAPON AT THEM -- FIRES!

          Jay and Kay DUCK -- the weapon just misses.

                         JAY

          Thanks.

                         KAY

          Let's get into trouble.

          Jay and Kay engage him --

          As they run off, the Lama calls --

                         LAMA

          Remember, please, to take the

          bridge.

          And we begin

          BIG FIGHT SET PIECE.

          Try to include motorcycle and horse elements. Could also

          involve the actual aqueduct, which is close by.

          At one point, Jay and Kay seem stuck, they remember...

                         JAY

          Take the bridge...

          They take the bridge, which gives them an advantage on Yaz.

          At one point, Jay corners Yaz -- Yaz BLASTS HIM -- Jay is

          knocked down. Looks DEAD! But he shakes it off reveal

          the PONG medallion blocked the shot.

          Culminating at a toxic waste dump in Staten Island, with Yaz

          compressed into .a six inch cube - hauled away in the back of

          a garbage truck.

          The guys give chase -- they want him captured, but no luck.

          The truck drives off...

          69.

                         KAY

          He's gone.

                         JAY

          Only a matter of time before he

          comes back. And this time he might

          be really mad.

          AQUEDUCT RACE TRACK

          Jay and Kay return to an EMPTY RACE TRACK...

          It's like a ghost town.

          No Archanans to be found...

                         JAY

          Damn, we lost them. They come all

          the way across the universe and

          just when we're about to figure out

          what all of this is about--

          Then, faintly... a CHEER

                         KAY

          Hold that thought.

          They follow it out to

                         THE TRACK

          Which is empty. No spectators, no horses. Just the

          Archanans...

          Who stand near the track watching... nothing.

          And yet --

          They cheer and clap as if watching the most exciting race

          ever.

          Jay and Kay exchange a "what the hell?" Look and approach

          them.

                         JAY

          Everybody OK?

                         ARCHANANS

          Everybody is everybody.

          70.

                         JAY

          Yeah... guess I can't argue with

          that. So listen up -- Yaz is down

          but he won't be for long, so we

          need to start coming up with some

          answers. First of all--

          The Archanans CHEER. Jay shakes it off.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         FIRST

          The Archanans CHEER AGAIN.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          What are you cheering about?!

                         ARCHANANS

          The races.

          Jay and Kay keep approaching... Puzzled -- the track is

          empty...

                         JAY

          What races?

          Jay and Kay cross the threshold into their aura... and now--

          The empty stands are FILLED WITH CHEERING SPECTATORS WATCHING

          AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING RACE.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Where are we?

          LAMA.

          We are tomorrow.

          Jay steps backwards, out of the aura -- back to empty ghost

          town.

          Steps back in -- tomorrow's rabid fans, cheering the race.

          From the Archanans' POV -- we see ALL VERSIONS/ALL AGES OF

          JAY AND KAY..

          The effect is -- THEY SEE ALL TIME AT ONCE.

                         JAY

          You... can see the future.

                         LAMA

          It is what you call the future.

          71.

                         ATTENDANT

          Ah, the future. An illusion of the

          time-bound, borne of the fallacy

          that one moment follows another.

                         LAMA

          Yaz suffers from this greatly. And

          so he must have revenge on your

          planet.

                         JAY

          Revenge?, For what?

                         LAMA

          He mourns the past because he can

          not see the dead are still as alive

          as they ever were. Just not now.

                         JAY

          Okay, someday you're gonna explain

          that to me, but right now you need

          to stop the riddles because there's

          about two minutes until Yaz crawls

          out of his hole and gets back to

          trying to kill you. So help me

          out. I need to know IN ENGLISH why

          Yaz is trying to kill you and what

          that has to do with saving the

          Earth.

                         ATTENDANT

          We know what he will know.

                         JAY

          You know what... he will know...

          (figuring it out)

          You know his plans.

                         (REALIZING)

          And you're going to stop him. He

          wants to kill you because you stop

          him.

                         LAMA

                         (CHEERFUL)

          Yes, if he does not kill us first.

                         KAY

          Don't you know if he's going to?

                         LAMA

          Sometimes he kills us, sometimes he

          does not. There are many futures.

          72.

                         JAY

          Okay, which future is the one where

          you live and the Earth doesn't blow

          up?

                         LAMA

          The one where you take us home.

          Jay and Kay exchange a look --

                         KAY

          Alright, let's get these freaks

          home, and pronto.

                         LAMA

          You must let go of your. attachment

          to time, beginning with your

          concept of "pronto."

          And on that -- THUP THUP THUP --

          12 Blacked-out helicopters...

           EX (V.0.)

                         (MEGAPHONE)

          Illegal aliens -- you are

          surrounded... Do not attempt to

          flee...

          Jay and Kay YELL INTO THE BACKWASH OF THE ROTORS:

                         JAY

          No! We need to get them home!

          But it's all drowned out in the wind and dust...

          MiB "squad cars" -- pull up and surround them.

          Jay and Kay look for an escape route -- but MiB cars and

          trucks seem to be pouring in from everywhere.

          MiB agents descend on ropes, round up the Archanans--

          EX (V.0.)

                         (MEGAPHONE)

          Agent Kay! Return to your vehicle!

          Rendezvous at headquarters in 20

          minutes! We will escort you by

          air!

          And from the noise and chaos of the choppers...

          To silence...

          73.

          INT. MIB HQ - BENCH OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM

          Jay and Kay watch through a glass wall.

          Inside the conference room -- the Archanans sit around a

          table.

          Ex paces, clearly talking ABOUT the Archanans to the other

          agents.

          Body language tells us the MiB reach some kind of consensus.

          Ex comes out -- Jay and Kay hop up.

          Ex notices Jay for the first time --

                         EX

          What's he doing here? Didn't we

          just bust you?

                         KAY

          That was someone else. All these

          mooners look alike, right?

          A beat -- and Ex buys it completely.

                         EX

          Yeah... So look. We've talked

          about it. And you are to be

          commended, Agent Kay. You did a

          fine job bringing these illegals

          in. Now it's our job to get them

          out of the city for containment.

          Somewhere where if someone decides

          to blow them off the map, the

          collateral damage will be

          insignificant. Toronto.

                         KAY

          But they're in danger. One of the

          most dangerous beings in the

          universe is out to kill them--

          (looks to Jay)

          And if that happens, we're all

          going with them, because they're

          our only hope of survival.

                         EX

          Christ, if we listened to every

          Mooner who showed up telling us how

          they were gonna save the world,

          that's all we'd do. Do you know

          why Earth is still standing?

                         (MORE)

          74.

                         EX (CONT'D)

          Why we're not a smoldering chunk of

          nothing? Because we don't stick

          our nose into other people's

          business. Especially people in

          danger, because they have enemies,

          and those enemies destroy Earth.

          Now. Are you going to execute my

          order or not?

                         KAY

                         (COLD)

          I thought we were supposed to be

          the good guys.

                         EX

          Careful, Agent Kay. That sounds

          like insubordination.

          Kay walks up to Ex, looks him DEAD IN THE EYE

                         KAY

          It sounds like you need to cut some

          eyeholes in your stomach, because

          your head is so far up your ass,

          that's the only way you could

          possibly see.

                         EX

          That's it. You're off this case.

          Stick to dry ice. If I catch you

          near them -- or him -- again, I'll

          have your badge.

          (to a bunch of other

                         AGENTS)

          You four -- take the Archanans to

          transpo.

          One of the agents looks up--

                         YOUNG AGENT

          Me? I'm just an accountant---

                         EX

          Go!!!

                         (TO JAY)

          And you... You just get out of

          here!

          The MiB agents GRAB the Archanans and hustle them out.

          Kay leans in to them--

                         KAY

          Don't worry, we'll--

          75.

                         LAMA

          Yes, we know.

          Kay looks up -- sees Jay smiling at him.

                         KAY

          What?

                         JAY

          I knew Agent Kay wasn't just gonna

          lie down. So what's the plan?

                         KAY

          You heard the man. We've got dry

          ice to investigate.

          GARBAGE COMPACTOR TRUCK

          It's the truck that "compacted" Yaz. We follow it to the

                         MIDDLE OF

          GIANT STATEN ISLAND DUMP

          Where the truck dumps its load... Including YAZ...

          Who gets PROCESSED AND PRESSED INTO A CUBE.

          On the cube -- it begins to swell and force itself back into

          its natural shape.

          Around the piles of garbage, other Yaz parts SEEK EACH OTHER

          OUT...

                         DUMP EXIT

          Workers stop what they're doing -- get out of the way of

          something, disturbed.

          We see Yaz and understand the reaction -- Yaz might be back

          together, but NOT AT ALL RIGHT -- a leg stuck in the wrong

          place, the head at a weird angle.

          He catches his reflection in a hubcap and adjusts himself...

          Pops out an eye, swaps an arm...

          He unfurls his tongue, smells the air --

                         YAZ

          Where did you go...

          76.

                         SHOWWORLD CENTER

          A SLEAZY GUY is suprised to see not just an agent... but four

          agents and four Hare-Krishna-looking guys come out of his

          peep show window.

          One of the Archanan attendants smiles at him:

                         ATTENDANT

                         (CHEERFUL)

          You will die alone.

                         SLEAZY GUY

          Yeah, I know.

          The agents lead the Archanans through the world's greatest

          emporium of sleaze.

          EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION

          The hustle and bustle -- cabs picking up and dropping off

                         PASSENGERS --

           We find a LONG LINE OF UNHAPPY KIDS, MAKING UNHAPPY PARENTS --

          Kids crying, pulling on Mom's dress...

          We see -- it's the line to an ICE CREAM TRUCK.

          And the line isn't moving because KAY IS QUESTIONING THE

          PAPER-HATTED VENDOR.

          DRY ICE SMOKE rises from the freezer:

                         KAY

          Just a few more questions about dry

          ice and I'll be out of your hair...

          A BIRD CALL makes Kay turn --.he sees Jay waving him over,

          pointing at something -- The MiB agents lead the Archanans

          into the Station!

                         VENDOR

          I told you ten times -- I got no

          idea what dry ice is!

                         KAY

          (not listening).

          Thanks, you've been very helpful.

          Jay and Kay peel off, follow the MiB agents, leaving the

          Vendor scratching his head. He turns back to the kids.

          Jay and Kay follow the MiBers and Archanans inside...

          77.

          INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION

          The Men in Black blend in easily with the guys going home to

          Greenwich, but the Archanans are easy to spot.

          Jay and Kay tail them -- and lose them for an instant!

          They spot a glimpse of robe, run after them, turn a corner --

          And it's just some Hare Krishnas.

                         KAY

          Damn. Wrong freaks.

          But Jay spots the Archanans...

                         JAY

          Over there, Kay!

          As they run off --

                         HARE KRISHNA

          Perhaps you'd like to join us for a

          vegetarian meal?

          Jay and Kay chase after the MiB agents and Archanans --

          The MiB agents approach a cordoned-off area with signs

          warning WET PAINT!

          The agents look around, then slip pass the ropes and through

          a NARROW DOOR marked "WET PAINT" or "MEN WORKING"

          Jay and Kay follow...

          Through the skinny half-painted door...

          THROUGH THE.SKINNY DOOR

          An EQUALLY SKINNY ESCALATOR descends 100s of feet. A

          problem: it's going the WRONG WAY -- bringing incognito

          aliens and MiB agents UP INTO GRAND CENTRAL.

          Jay and Kay muscle their way down -- lots of 'scuse me --

          pardon me -- hey, don't grab that!

          But once they power past the crowds, Jay's jaw drops as we

          reveal...

          78.

          SECRET TRAIN STATION

          A MUCH-BIGGER station under Grand Central, a secret hub for

          sending aliens back and forth all over the country.

          It's basically a series of GIANT PNEUMATIC TUBES --people-

          sized versions of the vacuum tubes that used to beeverywhere

          in banks, offices, etc.

          A mix of ALIENS and MIB AGENTS put on helmets and pads, board

          the tubes and FWOOP off...

          Quick shots -- a shoeshine stand set up for many-limbed

          aliens... a newsstand with strange papers... The Beatles in

          line for Liverpool with a blue meanie... Kareem Abdul-

          Jabbar...

                         KAY

          On your 2 o'clock.

          They spot the MiBers and the Archanans next to the TUBE TO

          CANADA.

          TUBE TO CANADA

          The MiB agents put helmets and pads on the Archanans.

          They're about to load them into the tubes --

          Jay and Kay approach:

                         KAY

          Hold up.

                         MIB

          You're off this case, Kay.

                         MIB 2

          Yeah, but I heard there's some dry

          ice in Queens. Magic show at a

          kid's birthday party. Better

          hustle, you can get there before.

          the cake.

          They all LAUGH at Kay.

                         KAY

          Change in plans.

                         MIB

          What? We didn't hear about any

          change in plans.

          79.

                         KAY

          Yeah, Ex just gave us the new

          orders -- check this out --

          Kay gestures them closer -- he reaches for something in his

          jacket pocket...

          The MiBers lean in...

          And Kay GRABS THEM AND SHOVES THEM BACKWARDS TOWARDS THE

          TUBE!

          The MiB agents stumble, surprised --

          The Archanans, not surprised, step deftly out of the way, the

          MiBers FWOOP FWOOP FWOOP into the tube...

          Jay and Kay exchange a smile and realize... One last VERY

          YOUNG agent is still standing there, wide-eyed:

                         YOUNG AGENT

          Don't hurt me! I'm just the

          accountant!

          He reaches for his radio... Jay talks him down:

                         JAY

          I know you're a little freaked out

          and you want to call for backup,

          but listen: When you've done this

          job for a while, you realize

          there's one rule -- things aren't

          what they seem. These are innocent

          beings that need our protection.

          Are you gonna do the right thing or

          are you gonna be a company man and

          send them off to die in Toronto?

          The young agent thinks -- puts down the radio.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Good, good. What's your name?

                         YOUNG AGENT

          Agent Zed, sir.

                         KAY

          You're gonna be okay, kid.

          Jay can't help laughing --

          80.

                         JAY

          He's gonna be better than OK. I'm

          not gonna give you so much shit

          anymore.

          The radio CRACKLES --

          EX (V.0.)

                         (ON RADIO)

          Zed, what's your status?

                         ZED

          Detainees are on the tube to

          Toronto. No sign of Kay. Over.

          EX (V.0.)

          Copy that, good work, Zed.

          Zed crosses off...

                         JAY

          Be nice to him. Trust me.

          Jay, Kay and the Archanans regroup.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Okay, you all wanted to go home.

          Well here we are. So how do you

          want to get off this rock? You

          guys have the spaceport on Long

          Island yet?

          Kay just looks at him.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          That place is a dump anyway. Best

          Margaritas in the Universe, my ass.

          What about the one in Ohio?

          The Archanans smile.

                         ATTENDANT

          Here is the way home.

          The Lama removes a postcard-sized card from his robe and

          hands it to one of his attendants.

          The attendant bows, and RITUALLY PASSES IT... it passes

          through all the attendants and then to JAY.

          Jay gives it a look.

                         JAY

          Here, huh? You're sure?

          81.

                         LAMA

          The only future that ends with life

          begins there.

                         JAY

          I'll take that as a strong "yes."

          Okay, then. Follow me.

          Jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the

          terminal. Kay catches up --

                         KAY

          Where are we going?

          Jay looks at him a beat.

                         JAY

          Omaha. And I'm gonna buy you the

          biggest T-bone you ever saw when we

          get there. So -- you head over to

          the Omaha tube and I'm gonna help

          these guys over here for a second.

          But I'll meet you in a minute. By

          the Omaha tube.

          They stare at each other --

                         KAY

          Sounds good. See you there.

          Kay turns to head off -- then, lightening fast, spins and

          reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card --

                         KAY (CONT'D)

          Omaha, my ass.

          Kay looks at the card: GREETINGS FROM SUNNY FLORIDA -- a

          tourist post card with palm trees, oranges and beaches.

                         KAY (CONT'D)

          Let's go.

                         JAY

          No, no, no. No way. Florida, Kay.

                         KAY

          That's what it says.

                         JAY

          Don't you get it?

                         KAY

          Yeah, it's hot and muggy. The old

          people drive slow.

                         (MORE)

          82.

                         KAY (CONT'D)

          We'll stay somewhere air-

          conditioned and only drive after

          three when they're at dinner.

                         JAY

          This is why you were there. In

          Florida. Because of them. You

          were helping them and that's why...

          that's why you get killed. Today,

          July 16. I saw the report myself.

          Agent Kay, dead at the scene.

          Killed by Yaz.

                         KAY

          You know what an MiB agent calls it

          when he faces death? Besides I got

          you to watch my back, right?

          They walk to the FLORIDA TUBE

                         JAY

          I just want you to know, I'm doing

          this out of love, man.

                         KAY

          Doing what?

          He gets his answer -- Jay DECKS HIM.

                         JAY

          You stay home and stay alive.

          But Kay isn't down.

                         KAY

          I told them I'd help them -- I'm

          honor-bound to do it.

          Kay throws a DIRTY SUCKER-PUNCH to Jay's kidney.

          Jay recovers and throws an UPPERCUT to Kay's solar plexus.

          Jay winces -- like he just hit something hard.

                         JAY

          Damn, you used to have some abs.

          They continue to pound each other. As they trade punches:

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          I can't let you go to Florida.

                         KAY

          I make my own future! Besides --

          I'm younger and stronger than you!

          83.

          They both attempt an identical spin kick at the same time --

          feet collide.

                         JAY

          Bet you're sorry you taught me

          that.

          The fight continues... They're wearing down, circling each

          other...

          And then Kay fakes a left ---

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          You always lead with your--

          But this time Kay connects with his right, knocking Jay down

          hard.

                         KAY

          Had enough yet?

          On Jay -- gasping, spent -- using every last reserve of

          strength to lift himself off that floor.

                         JAY

          I can't let you go -- I love you!

          Jay KICKS KAY SAVAGELY IN THE GROIN. Kay LUNGES AT JAY.

          They CLINCH... it's a stalemate...

                         KAY

          Aw, hell, look at that-- behind you-

                         JAY

          I'm not falling for that.

                         KAY

          I'm not kidding --

          Kay rotates their clinch towards the tube so Jay can see...

          The ARCHANANS -- very cheerfully, benignly hopping into the

          FLORIDA TUBE.

          Jay and Kay share a look -- and both run INTO THE TUBE!

          THROUGH THE TUBES

          Jay, Kay and the Archanans hurtle through the MiB system of

          pneumatic tubes.

          84.

          The Archanans fly through the tubes, relaxed and happy,

          moving gracefully, like fish through water...

          Kay is in perfect controlled tube position -- everything

          clenched, hands by his sides, looking like he's in an "air

          luge"...

          Jay is SCREAMING and ricocheting off the sides of the tube

          like a pinball...

          They shoot SOUTH, passing landmarks of the Eastern

          seaboard...

          Intercut with Jay's face -- blown back like Right Stuff

          astronauts in a G-Force simulator.

          Jay FLAILS towards the Archanans, grabs onto the Lama's robe:

                         JAY

          (yelling over the wind

                         NOISE)

          I have to know -- can I really

          prevent Kay's murder?

                         LAMA

          Yes.

                         JAY

          Oh. Okay, then. Thanks, good to

          hear.

                         LAMA

          But where there was death, there

          will be death.

                         JAY

          What does that mean?

          The Lama smiles and zips ahead through the current. Jay gets

          CLOBBERED by a bend in the tube.

          EXT. FIELD

          Sugar cane workers pick crops next to a GIANT IRRIGATION

          PIPE.

          They look up as SCREAMS DOPPLER THROUGH THE PIPE -- what the

          hell was that?

          We follow the SCREAM...

          85.

          BACK IN THE TUBE

          Jay CONTINUES TO SCREAM --

          TUBE P.A. (V.0.)

          All passengers, prepare to de-tube.

                         JAY

          De-tube?

          TUBE P.A. (V.0.)

          Please make sure all helmet and

          crash suit straps are securely

          fastened.

          On Jay -- no helmet, no crash suit.

                         JAY

          Helmet? No one said anything about

                         A--

          POOP!

          EXT. FLORIDA SWAMP/MANATEE PRESERVE - END OF THE TUBE

          Jay, Kay and the Archanans are launched from the tube like

          human cannonballs...

          The Archanans land gracefully, floating down air currents

          like kung fu masters...

          Kay hits with both feet and rolls...

          Jay face plants into the water.

          Jay looks up -- FIVE MANATEES STARE HIM DOWN. The ALPHA

          MANATEE emits along, lowing manatee song which RESOLVES INTO

                         COUGHING --

                         ALPHA MANATEE

          Sorry, I have something in my

          throat. They went that way...

                         JAY

          Thanks.

          Surrounded by thick brush, trees. Jay staggers out of the

          water, looking beat to hell.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Kay? Archanans? Everyone OK?

          86.

          Reveal -- Everyone else looks clean and pressed. Jay looks

          around -- nothing but brush and swamp.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Listen, your, uh...

          Arachaness...ness? I don't think

          this here is the way back to your

          planet.

          The Archanans smile and WALK OFF... Jay and Kay follow --

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Hey wait -- we can't help you get

          home, if you don't tell us how...

          He trails off as they EMERGE FROM THE BRUSH

          And stop dead...

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Whoa. So that's how you're getting

          home.

          Reveal -- A GLORIOUS SHOT OF THE APOLLO ROCKET

          And they head towards destiny...

          CAPE CANAVERAL - LAUNCH SITE

          Jay and Kay take in the MASSIVE SCENE...

          The huge crowd, the security, the press. HISTORY IN THE

          MAKING.

          T-Minus 30 minutes.

                         JAY

          Okay. So we've got... 30 minutes

          to get past security. Get into

          Mission Control. Reprogram the

          flight path, pull the Astronauts

          off the launch and get them in that

          rocket.

                         KAY

          Well, then. Better get started.

                         JAY

          Weird. I feel like I've been here.

                         (BEAT)

          Okay, I've got a plan to get

          through security. We just need to

          be invisible.

          87.

          YAZ ON HIS BIKE

          Hurtling down the highway on his superfast bike, kicking up a

          HUGE DUSTSTORM...

          He gets STUCK BEHIND AN 18-WHEELER. Yaz REVS -- and SPEEDS

          RIGHT THROUGH THE TRUCK, SPLITTING IT IN HALF.

          Down the CAUSEWAY -- the rocket in the distance...

          EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE

          Heavily guarded by AIR FORCE SECURITY -- people with a lot of

          guns and very little sense of humor.

          And up steps Jay, leading Kay and the Archanans.

          JAY (O.S.)

          'Scuse me... I need to get

          inside... I've got the big man's

          Cadillac... all washed and ready to-

          Before the words are out of Jay's mouth, he's down on the

          ground with a submachine gun stuck in his neck.

                         GUARD

          Move and it's the last thing you

          do!

          The security is on Kay and the Archanans, forcing them down.

          Kay gives Jay a look --

                         KAY

          Good work. It's like we're not

          even here.

                         GUARD

                         (INTO RADIO)

          Sir, this is unit 3 bravo -- we

          have an attempted perimeter breach

          into mission control subhallway

          Charlie. One caucasian, one

          negroid, four... other. Yes, sir.

          We'll hold them here, sir.

                         JAY

          You've got it wrong, let me explain-

          88.

                         GUARD

          Shut up! Anything you have to say,

          you can say to my superior officer!

          And boy does he hate your kind...

          A click... click... click... Someone is approaching. Someone

          who walks like they mean business.

                         GUARD (CONT'D)

          Lt. Colonel! Here are the

          intruders, sir!

          Jay cranes to see the Colonel -- he's African American. Jay

          grins, relieved --

                         JAY

          Finally, someone I can talk to--

          But the Colonel is on him before you can blink, an equal-

          opportunity hardass to the extreme:

                         COLONEL

          The only thing we're gonna talk

          about is what specific breed of

          dumbass you have to be to try to

          penetrate my launch site!

          He begins patting Jay down. Eyes widen --

                         COLONEL

          Weapon! You are going away for a

          long time...

          (to his men)

          Get them into holding. We'll

          interrogate them after the launch.

          A beat... and Jay goes for it:

                         JAY

          Sir, before you do that --- my name

          is Agent Jay. I appreciate your

          position, but I'm from a top-secret

          government agency in charge of

          protecting the world from the scum

          of the universe and right now, on

          behalf of the people of Earth, I.:

          need to commandeer your rocket so

                         THEY--

          (points to Archanans)

          --can board it. Can we count on

          your help?

          The Colonel stares at him for a beat..

          89.

                         COLONEL

          So you want us to stop the most

          massive endeavor in American

          history, an event being watched by

          the entire world, the moment that

          will be the culmination of a

          challenge put to us by President

          John F. Kennedy himself... so a

          bunch of Hare Krishnas can take a

          joy ride?

                         JAY

          Would it help if I told you I'm

          from the future?

                         COLONEL

          Get them out of here!

          He motions to the other MPs, who move to roust the group...

          But the Lama takes the Colonel by the arm--

                         COLONEL (CONT'D)

          Hey!

          --and PULLS HIM INTO HIS AURA.

          On THE COLONEL'S face... He sees something POWERFUL

          The Lama releases him...

          The officer is stunned for a moment. Blinks back into focus

          and turns to the other guards --

                         COLONEL (CONT'D)

          You men are no longer needed here.

          Report to delta gate.

                         GUARD

          Sir?

                         COLONEL

          Go!

                         GUARD

          Yes, sir...

          The Colonel turns to Jay, Kay and the Archanans:

                         COLONEL

          The rest of you, come with me.

          The Colonel heads into the building. They follow.

          90.

                         JAY

          Things change when you can see the

          future, right?

                         COLONEL

          They sure do. This is definitely

          about some next-level shit.

          The PA crackles:

          P.A. (V.0.)

          T-minus seven minutes to launch...

          MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE - UNDERGROUND HALLWAY

          Mission control is an underground hub with hallway "spokes".

          Jay, Kay and the Archanans follow the Colonel down the

          hallway towards the main Mission Control center.

                         MISSION CONTROL

          A hive of activity leading up to the launch.. Miles and

          miles of white guys in buzzcuts and shortsleeve button-down

          shirts. Thick glasses, slide rules, pocket protectors -- a

          sea of IBM men.

          Everyone smoking, RUSHING AROUND, LAST-MINUTE CHAOS...

          Hunkered over computer monitors... reel-to-reel data tapes

          spinning. Less computing power than an iPhone, but we put a

          man on the moon.

          P.A. (V.0.)

          T-minus six minutes...

                         JAY

          Attention, everyone! We've got a

          change in plans!

          Everyone's consumed with the launch and wearing headsets --

          they ignore him -- he keeps trying --

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Hey! Attention over here! I need

          to talk to the man who can re-

          program this rocket!

          Still nothing --

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Can anyone hear me? Hey! You in

          the glasses!

          91.

          25 people in identical giant black plastic glasses turn.

           COLONEL (O.S.)

          Agent Jay! Over here!

          They see the Colonel with an Engineer at a workstation.

                         COLONEL (CONT'D)

          This is your man.

          The guys approach the Engineer --

                         ENGINEER

          You see this card? The rocket's

          flight path is all on cards just

          like this one. Right here --

          He indicates a long metal rack, like a mail-sorting machine,

          that holds many 1000s of cards and feeds them into a

          processor.

          An Archanan approaches and BLOWS ON THE CARDS -- it hits the

          cards like a mini-whirlwind. The cards spiral everywhere

          like bats pouring out of a cave -- chads fly off -- they're

          magically re-programmed! And fly back into the rack.

          The engineers are STUNNED. And then PANIC:

                         ENGINEER (CONT'D)

          The trajectory has been altered!

          A BIG LOW-TECH GRAPHIC APPEARS on the BIG LOW-RES MONITOR:

          TRAJECTORY CHANGE.

                         ENGINEER (CONT'D)

          Abort launch! Abort launch!

                         JAY

          Slow down there! Everyone be cool!

                         ENGINEER

          Coolness is an inappropriate

          response!

          The Engineer flips the SAFETY off a red button marked "ABORT"

                         ENGINEER (CONT'D)

          Aborting in 5...

                         JAY

          No! Stop! Do not abort!

                         ENGINEER

          4...

          92.

          The Engineer raises his ABORTING HAND -- About to slam it

          down in the button!

                         - KAY

          This might help.

          Kay reaches into his jacket, takes out WHAT APPEARS TO BE A

                         NEURALIZER

                         JAY

          What's that? You been holding out

          on me?

                         KAY

          Little something I've been working

          on. Glasses if you've got 'em.

          Jay and Kay put on their glasses...

                         ENGINEER

          2.

          Jay and Kay in sunglasses -- for a moment, it's the iconic

          look of the posters...

                         JAY

          Ha ha, just like old times...

                         KAY

          Oh, and you might want to get under

          a desk.

                         JAY

          Get under a--?

                         ENGINEER

          One!

          The engineers hand comes down... but before he can hit the

                         BUTTON --

          Kay hits the trigger --

          But instead of a FLASH --

          A MILLION PELLETS EXPLODE OUT OF THE NEURALIZER -- bouncing

          everywhere, knocking out the engineers.

          The pellets KEEP WHIZZING EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING:

          Jay and Kay have to talk over the sounds of people getting

          KO'd.

          93.

                         JAY

          What the hell was that??

                         KAY

          It's a high-velocity non-lethal

          pellet-gun. The boys in the lab

          call it the "hiv-nol-pog."

                         JAY

          Catchy.

          The Archanans deftly step out of the way -- or the pellets

          swerve around them.

          EX RUNS IN, flanked by security and/or MiB agents.

                         EX

          It's Kay! There he is! Take him

          down! Shoot him if you have to!

          EX catches a PELLET TO THE GROIN, crumples.

          The pellets settle... quiet...

          P.A. (V.0.)

          T-minus... Five minutes.

          The engineers start COMING TO, dazed, wondering WHAT THE HELL

          JUST HAPPENED -- Kay and Jay give them a "neuralizer" cover

                         STORY:

                         JAY

                         (TO CROWD)

          What the hell is wrong with you

          people? Raquel Welch comes by for

          a personal tour of Mission Control

          and you faint like a bunch of

          schoolgirls!

                         KAY

          What a waste.

                         ENGINEER

          Raquel Welch was here?

                         JAY

          Five minutes to get to the rocket.

          And keep your eyes open for Yaz.

          They head out.

                         CUT TO:

          94.

          ON THE TARMAC

          With only a few minutes to go, service trucks CLEAR THE

          TARMAC -- dozens of fuel trucks, etc., Driving to get a safe

          distance away from the blast.

          The all SWERVE OUT OF THE WAY

          As one car cuts through them GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY, parting

          the waters -- it's a military jeep -- THE COLONEL at the

          wheel, Jay, Kay and the rest, barely hanging on.

                         CUT TO:

          ASTRONAUT TRANSPORT -- DRIVING

          The apollo astronauts ride across the tarmac towards the

          rocket. The only car. Looking up at that rocket.

          On NEIL ARMSTRONG, practicing:

                         NEIL ARMSTRONG

                         (GRANDIOSE)

          That's one little step that I did,

          one big step for the rest of you...

          Wait, that's not it. Did that

          sound weird to you guys?

          The driver SLAMS ON THE BRAKES

                         BUZZ ALDRIN

          What in Sam Hill is going on?

          Reveal the Jeep, pulled in front of the Astronauts, cutting

          them off.

                         KAY

          No disrespect meant, [major]. I'm

          a big fan. (Especially of the

          haircut.)

                         JAY

          But we've got some bigger fish to

          fry. Hand over the flight suits.

          They start pulling the astronauts off the truck.

          The astronauts protest.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Let's go, people. Why don't you

          take one giant leap out of there.

          95.

          They look at Jay and Kay... at the Colonel...

                         COLONEL

          That's right, gentlemen. You need

          to listen to them. We're going to

          protocol twelve.

          The astronauts acquiesce.

                         BUZZ ALDRIN

          I didn't want to get in that death

          trap anyways.

                         NEIL ARMSTRONG

          I'm still getting my parade, right?

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE

          The same guards who stopped Jay and Kay are back on duty.

          They hear something -- they draw weapons --

          And it's Yaz. Still looking like evil incarnate. The guards

          take in this unholy picture...

                         GUARD

                         WHAT THE--

                         YAZ

          I want in.

          The guards look at each other --

                         GUARD

          Should we radio the Colonel?

                         GUARD (CONT'D)

          You wanna get yelled at again?

          They wave him by.

                         GUARD (CONT'D)

          Go ahead.

                         LAUNCH PLATFORM

          Kay loads the Archanans into the capsule., Technicians in

          clean suits assist.

          96.

          Jay works like a secret service agent -- scanning for all

          possible threats.

          Jay checks his stop watch -- Four minutes to go...

          Kay works'with the Archanans--

                         JAY

          We good yet, Kay? I don't like

          being out here in the open -- too

          many ways for Yaz to get to you...

                         KAY

          I'm almost there.

          Kay's got them inside, but having problems with the hatch.

                         KAY (CONT'D)

          Hey, tech guys -- get back here and

          help me with the door.

                         TECH

          It's called-a hatch.

                         KAY

          Whatever, just get over here.

                         JAY

          Oh, come on -- what's going on?

                         KAY

          This door is complicated.

                         JAY

          Oh, for...

                         KAY

          What? It's an Apollo rocket, not a

          Plymouth Valiant, OK? It's

          complicated.

          Jay goes over to help Kay with the door.

          They both fuss and fight over the door.

                         JAY

          Lift it. You have to lift it.

                         KAY

          No, I am lifting it. You have to

          hold the lever.

          97.

                         JAY

          No, if I hold the lever, the rubber

          thingie won't... go in the thing

          where the thingie goes...

          Kay notices something in the reflection of the hatch glass.

                         KAY

          Jay... Why do you think a highly

          trained NASA technician would leave

          the back of his suit unzipped?

          They exchange a look that parallels the opening scene in the

          Chinese restaurant...

                         JAY

          Because it's about to go down.

          They turn around, draw weapons on the tech -- it's YAZ!

          NOTE TO READER:

          Welcome to the good stuff

          From here, we launch into a GIANT SET PIECE that will take us

          up and around the Apollo Rocket...

          As Jay and Kay battle Yaz and Devil Girl in a super-high-

          stakes confrontation to protect the Archanans...

           We will pay off that YAZ ISAVIRUS, bentonDESTROYINGTHE

          EARTH to avenge the deaths ofhis brothers --smallpoxand

          bubonic plague.

          The launch clock ticks down -- the action moves around pipes

          breathing fire, the gigantic scaffolding, liquid oxygen

          spewing from the rocket... All on top of a rocket taller than

          a 30-story skyscraper.

          With T-minus 25 seconds to go, Jay and Kay corner Yaz against

          the lunar capsule.

          BACK TO SCENE:

          Yaz laughs at Jay and Kay.

                         YAZ

          You can't stop me! Nothing on

          Earth can stop me!

                         JAY

          Nothing now.

          Yaz raises an eyebrow...

          98.

          Jay draws his NOISY CRICKET -- the gun he brought from the

          future.

                         KAY

          What's that?

                         JAY

          Little something I brought with me.

          Jay points the gun at Yaz -- but Yaz just LAUGHS --

          As the clock ticks down to T-minus 5... 4...

                         YAZ

          Try it! You wouldn't dare! One

          false shot and you'll rip space and

          time!

                         JAY

          That's a chance I'll have to take.

          Jay BLASTS YAZ

          Yaz stumbles BACK INTO THE CAPSULE... The hatch SLAMS him in!

          Just as the ROCKET BEGINS LIFTOFF--

          HUGE FLAMES - HUGE CLOUDS OF SMOKE THREATEN TO ENGULF JAY AND

                         KAY -

                         KAY

          Uh oh --

          But the Archanans surround them with their aura -- where the

          flames and smoke flow harmlessly around them...

          And then it's over...

          BIG VICTORY MOMENT

          As they watch the rocket carry Yaz off...

                         JAY

          We did it, partner. I hope you

          remember this when you recruit me --

          you won't give me such a hard time.

                         KAY

          You know I will.

                         JAY

          Yeah.

          99.

                         KAY

          I guess we'll have to build a

          prison on the moon or something.

          Jay realizes -- grabs Kay --

                         JAY

          Do a better job this time, OK?

          That needs to be one hell of a

          prison. You don't want that guy

          coming back, or I'm coming back.

          Look, once was enough, OK?

          Jay turns to The Colonel --

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Thank you for your help, sir. Hope

          we don't get you fired.

                         COLONEL

          Not too worried about that.

                         JAY

          Can I ask you -- what did the Lama

          show you in there that made you

          help us? Was it the Earth being

          destroyed?

                         COLONEL

          No -- it was my son. All grown up.

          As a matter of fact, I'm late to

          see him -- I promised I'd watch the

          launch with him.

                         JAY

          Oh. Thanks. He's a lucky kid.

                         COLONEL

          I'm a lucky dad. Take care.

          Jay offers him a handshake. The officer takes it -- and

          pulls Jay into a hug.

                         JAY

          Okay...

          The Colonel leaves. Jay and Kay congratulate each other,

          smile over a job well done...

          But then they see the Archanans... And realize...

          100.

                         KAY

          We're sorry we didn't get you home,

          guys. It was the only way to get

          rid of Yaz.

                         JAY

          But we'll make sure you're safe

          here. And the next rocket out...

                         LAMA

          All is well. You have done well.

                         JAY

          No we didn't. You wanted to go

          home...

                         LAMA

          There is what we desire and what

          must be... And now our gift to

          you...

                         JAY

          Gift? But we didn't get you home.

                         ARCHANANS

          There is the action and there is

          the intention. It is the intention

          we reward.

                         LAMA

          You did the right thing. And if

          humans are capable of such

          sacrifice, such friendship...

          perhaps we ARE already home.

                         JAY

          So then what's the gift?

                         LAMA

          You already have it.

          Jay looks at pong.

                         JAY

          This? Pong?

                         LAMA

          Yes. PONG. The Pan-Galactic

          Ordnance Negation Grid. Agent Kay

          will use this technology...

                         JAY

          To make the missile defense system.

          You use this to save the world.

          101.

                         ARCHANANS

          Yes. Don't drop it.

          They take the PONG and drape it around Kay's neck

          The Archanans leave, chanting...

                         ARCHANANS (CONT'D)

                         (CHANTING)

          Bip... Bip... Bip...

          And it's just Jay and Kay.

          Jay looks at Kay wearing the PONG... just like in the case

          file picture...

                         JAY

          Hey. My watch stopped.

          We see -- a minute to go. Jay looks at the watch. Something

          about it bothers him...

                         KAY

          C'mon. Let's go watch that bastard

          leave the atmosphere.

                         JAY

          Yeah, I'll catch up with you in a

          second.

          KAY GETS INTO THE ELEVATOR

          Jay hangs back, approaches the Archanans, walks them down the

          scaffolding.

                         JAY

          So you guys understand all this

          time stuff, right? So is

          everything going to be okay now? I

          mean, if I saved everything, and

          Yaz is really gone, why am I even

          here? Shouldn't I not have come in

          the first place? And why do I

          still have time left on my watch?

                         UNDERGROUND

          The scaffolding leads Jay and the Archanans into the maze of

          underground hallways.

          Jay walks, looking at his watch, thinking...

          102.

          ,He sees a WALL CLOCK -- 3:59.

                         JAY

          3:59. But Kay didn't get killed

          until...

          And then the AWFUL REALIZATION --

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          He didn't come yet! Kay, he didn't

          come yet!!!

          Jay races to find Kay.

                         WITH KAY

          Unaware that his appointment with death is near...

          WITH YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL

          Racing down a hallway... hunting Kay...

                         WITH JAY

          Running... running... searching... where is Kay?

          INTERCUT BETWEEN KAY... YAZ... JAY...

          All converging on destiny...

                         WITH JAY

          Running... more frantic now...

          And then he sees him!

          Kay -- at the end of the hallway!. Backlit by the door to

          the outside...

                         JAY

          Kay!

          And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there!

          Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot!

          Yaz pulls his guns...

          103.

          Kay turns to see Yaz -- there's no time to react, only to

          know HE'S ABOUT TO DIE!

          Yaz FIRES!!

          But -- THE COLONEL is somehow there instead! He catches the

          bullet for Kay -- his body dematerializes.

          And it gives Jay the split-second he needs to FIRE ON YAZ AND

          KILL HIM, blowing him OUTSIDE -- where he is INCINERATED BY

          LIQUID OXYGEN leftover from the launch.

          They look at each other -- it's over.

                         KAY

          See? I knew you had my back.

          Jay hears footsteps. Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALL

          MAN -- REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO JAY'S OWN SILHOUETTE.

          As the footsteps approach, the shadow grows smaller,

          shrinking to KID SIZE. It's a boy.

                         KID'S VOICE

          Dad? What's going on?

          The kid steps into the light -- backlit -- but from the shape

          of his head and Jay's reaction, this kid could only be YOUNG

          JAY.

                         JAY

          Where there is death, there will

          always be death. He saved your

          life. He swapped his for yours.

          He saved the world.

          Kay puts a firm hand on Jay --

                         KAY

          I'll take it from here.

          Kay steps away... but turns back.

          In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses

          Kay a modern Neuralizer.

                         JAY

          Leave me some memories this time,

          OK?

                         KAY

          Sure, partner. I'll see you

          around.

          104.

                         JAY

          Yes you will.

          Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand.

          Jay watches them from a distance:

          Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body

          was -- hands it to the son.

                         KAY

          Hey, look -- your Dad wanted you to

          have this.

          Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key chain.

          Jay looks in his pocket -- the same key chain, scratched and

          worn.

                         YOUNG JAY

          Where is he?

                         KAY

          Your daddy had to go -- he's part

          of the space program, now. He's

          okay, he just had to take a trip up

          to the stars, but you'll be just

          fine. I'll keep an eye on you...

          They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo

          launch...

          Jay takes out his iPhone and ALL GOES WHITE...

          PURE WHITE LIGHT...

          And it resolves into...

          NEW YORK - BACK TO PRESENT DAY...

          Jay comes to in the Apple Store, looks to the sky and

          THE MISSILES ARE STILL COMING!!!

                         JAY

          Noo!!!!

          And then...

          A giant PONG PADDLE rises over the horizon and

          PONGS THE MISSILES BACK INTO SPACE

          105.

          EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING

          Jay is walking on air -- thrilled to see the deadpan security

          guard.

                         JAY

          It's good to see you, man.

          He gives him a hug-- gets a "what the hell?" face.

          INT. MIB HQ

          Jay is thrilled to be back -- hugging everyone he can.

          No one else knows what he's talking about -- from their POV

          he never left... It all seems the same except for quick shots

          of Ex the bitter janitor, aged Devil Girl pushing the coffee

          cart...

          Jay bounces through the MiB HQ -- it's just a regular day to

          everyone else, but it's HOME SWEET HOME to Jay.

          He even gives the worm guys a big, gushy hug.

          A crowd of people gathers around Kay, congratulating him on

          winning the Bowling trophy... AGAIN.

          Kay looks up -- SMILES BIG when he sees Jay.

                         KAY

          Alright, everyone, give me and my

          partner here a minute.

          They leave the guys alone. A beat -- and Jay just wraps him

          in THE BIGGEST HUG EVER.

                         JAY

          It's good to see you, man. So

          good. I just... do you remember...

          I mean, do you know what I've been

          through?

          Kay just stares at him.

                         KAY

          You mean, do I remember that you

          travelled back in time to save my

          life and the world? Not bad,

          slick. Not bad.

                         JAY

          No problem. You'd do the same for

          me. I just have one question...

                         (MORE)

          106.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          When you disappeared... Why didn't

          I forget you when everyone else

          did?

                         KAY

          Well, I don't know exactly.

          Because I was dead. But in a

          quantum reality, objects can exist

          in contradictory states... So

          multiple timelines with varying

          probabilities can exist, and the

          one you're closest to

                         MATHEMATICALLY--

                         JAY

          Oh, you're talking about our

          closeness... you're talking about

          our love... Across timelines!

          You're saying our love will go on!

          Kay swats him away -- but the love couldn't be more clear.

          Jay feels something in his pocket -- the keychain. Takes it

          out.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          He was a good man.

                         KAY

          Yes he was.

                         JAY

          I'm glad I know that.

                         KAY

          So you travelled back in time, huh?

                         JAY

          Yep.

                         KAY

          Wow. And you didn't change

          anything?

                         JAY

          No.

                         KAY

          You're sure? Because the littlest

          thing can have huge repercussions.

                         JAY

          I was very careful.

          107.

                         KAY

          Good man, good man. Well, let's

          get you a uniform.

                         JAY

          Excuse me?

          We PULL BACK --

          Revealing PRESENT DAY MIB IN ALL ITS KICKASS GRANDEUR.

          Eternally vigilant in the struggle to protect the Earth and

          all its inhabitants...

          And every one of those agents wearing BLUE SUITS WITH SHORTS.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

          Even I can't make that look good.

          FADE TO BLACK.
