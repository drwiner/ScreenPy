                              MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY

                                   Screenplay by

                          Woody Allen & Marshall Brickman

          NOTE

          Most of the sequences in this production are filmed using a hand-

          held camera or a Steadycam. These very mobile cameras move around

          the set, and get constantly closer and further from the

          characters. Still, we'll be using the usual technical terms, such

          as long shot or full shot or medium shot here and there to

          give the reader an idea of the location of the camera at the

          beginning of each sequence. And then we'll mention the movements

          of the camera.

          We hear jazz music during the credits.

          END OF CREDITS

          NEW-YORK - AERIAL VIEW - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          While the camera is flying over New-York, we keep on hearing the

          jazz music.

          The camera reaches a round building that looks like a stadium and

          starts moving around the building.

          HOCKEY GAME - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Long shot on the skating rink. A hockey game is in progress on the

          rink. The camera follows a player, and then pans on the audience.

          The camera stops on a medium shot of Larry and Carol, a couple in

          their early fifties. Larry seems fascinated by the game, but Carol

          seems to find it boring. She looks at the ceiling, and then puts

          her hand over her mouth to suppress a yawn. Larry turns toward

          her.

                          LARRY

           Come on.

                          CAROL

           What?

                          LARRY

           You promised to sit through the entire hockey game without

           being bored and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you

           next week.

                          CAROL

           I know, honey, I promised. I know.

                          LARRY

           I already bought the earplugs.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. Well, with your eyesight, I'm surprised you can see

           the puck.

          The crowd starts yelling and we guess that one of the players has

          done something really good. Carol mockingly claps her hands.

                          CAROL

           Yay, hooray.

          Then she raises her eyes to the ceiling, seeming more bored than

          ever.

          LARRY'S BUILDING - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT

          A nice-looking apartment building in New-York.

          Full shot of the lobby. We see the street through the glass door.

          An uniformed attendant is standing near a counter, on which he is

          writing on a book.

          Larry and Carol are coming from the street and entering the

          building. He is carrying some shopping bags, and she is reading a

          newspaper, the Daily News.

                          LARRY

           God. I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out.

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

          The attendant slightly turns around and bows to them. They bow

          back to him. He goes back to his book-keeping, and the couple

          keeps on walking through the lobby.

                          LARRY

           You know, there's a Bob Hope movie on television later.

                          CAROL

           know. Can you believe this guy in Indiana ? Killed twelve

           victims, dismembered them and ate them.

                          LARRY

           Really ? Well, it's an alternative lifestyle.

                          CAROL

           Yeah, I'll say.

          They reach the two elevators. Larry presses the call-button on the

          wall between the two elevators.

          LARRY'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium shot inside the cabin of the elevator. The inner door

          slides open. Carol enters first, still reading her newspaper.

          Larry enters behind her and presses a button on the control panel.

           PAUL (voice over)

           Hold the elevator.

           LILLIAN (voice over)

           I'm coming.

          Hearing people's voices, Larry puts his hand on the edge of the

          door to keep it from closing.

           PAUL (voice over)

           Hold the elevator.

          Paul and Lilian enter the elevator. They are a middle-aged couple.

          He is bald and tall, and very smily. She is small, with grey hair.

                          LILLIAN

           That's right.

                          PAUL

           Thank you.

          Lilian has a broad smile when she recognizes Larry and Carol. The

          elevator door slides shut. Lilian looks at Carol.

                          LILLIAN

           I, uh, I see you at the gym sometimes.

                          CAROL

           Oh, you do ?

                          LILLIAN

           Yeah, we live in the apartment down the hall.

                          CAROL

           Oh, well, I go whenever I have the discipline.

                          LILLIAN

           It's important to put that time in. It does wonders.

                          CAROL

           Oh god, yeah. I agree with you.

                          LILLIAN

           Exercising changed my life.

                          CAROL

           Well, geez...

                          LARRY

           I prefer to atrophy. I'm not a very exercise person.

                          PAUL

           We bought a treadmill last week.

                          CAROL

           Oh, well, we had one. But you know, we got rid of it

           because it was just taking up too much space.

                          LILLIAN

           Oh, it-it-it...

                          LARRY

           Because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a

           while. That was her problem.

                          LILLIAN

           Hey, I... exactly, I... and it's so confusing, with all

           those buttons and computerized programs. I'm just never

           gonna get that.

          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Full shot of a very sober and modern hallway. Creme-colored walls,

          grey carpeting, dark wooden doors.

          We hear the elevator door opening and Carol comes out, followed by

          Lilian, Larry and Paul. They all talk together and we can hardly

          understand the following dialogue.

                          CAROL

           Oh, I know. It's late.

                          LILLIAN

           It's so wonderful, meeting.

                          CAROL

           Oh, well, yeah.

                          PAUL

           It is just like New York. You have neighbors. You never

           meet them... You guys...

          The following line, said by Lilian, is clearer and we understand

          it better.

                          LILLIAN

           ... I've seen you so many times in the hallway, you know...

           and I've always wanted to come up and say hallo.

                          PAUL

           Well, anyway... good night.

          Larry and Carol walk away from Lilian and Paul, who remain near

          the elevator.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Good night. Such a lovely couple. You know that...

          Paul bends down to pick up something on the carpet. Lilian walks

          one step in Larry's direction.

                          LILLIAN

           Oh, uh, say, hello ?

          Paul starts opening his apartment door, just across the hallway

          from the elevator.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Huh ? Yeah ?

                          LILLIAN

           Huh, listen... why don't you come in for a-a-a second and

           have a drink with us ? I mean, we'd really love that.

          The camera pans around toward Larry and Carol. Larry makes a

          negative sign with his hand.

                          CAROL

           Oh, oh well that'd be fine...

           PAUL (voice over)

           She makes great Irish coffee.

          Mute conversation between Carol and Larry. Larry evidently doesn't

          want to accept Lilian's invitation, but Carol wants to.

           LILLIAN (voice over)

           Oh, please ? Uh uh, I want you to give me a treadmill

           lesson.

                          LARRY

           There's a movie on television I want to watch.

          Carol starts walking toward Lilian and Paul's apartment, followed

          reluctantly by Larry.

          The camera pans around during Carol's next line, and we see Carol

          entering Lilian an Paul's apartment.

                          CAROL

           Oh, about the tread... oh, well, if I can figure it out,

           then believe me, anybody can.

          She laughs, and Larry, entering the apartment behind her, utters a

          forced laugh.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          The cosy apartment of middle upper-class people. The decoration

          looks like them.

          Medium shot of Lilian walking across the bedroom toward the large

          double bed. She walks near the famous treadmill.

                          LILLIAN

           Have a look at the instructions. They drive me crazy. You

           know ? I don't know what I'm doing at all. Let's look...

           CAROL (voice over)

           No. Please, it's easy.

          Lilian picks up a book on a table near the bed.

                          LILLIAN

           Wonderful book they've given me. Now I'm at level five.

           CAROL (voice over)

           What ?

                          LILLIAN

           That I know.

           CAROL (voice over)

           You're that advanced ?

                          LILLIAN

           Well, yeah.

           CAROL (voice over)

           God, I only got to level two.

          Lilian brings the book to Carol.

                          LILLIAN

           Look at these diagrams. Do you believe this ?

                          CAROL

           That's amazing.

          She is standing near the treadmill. Lilian shows her one of the

          diagram in the book.

                          LILLIAN

           I can't understand this even.

                          CAROL

           Let me see.

                          LILLIAN

           Yeah, well. See this ?

                          CAROL

           Okay.

          PAUL'S APPARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          One of the wall could be a bay window, but, for the moment, it is

          entirely covered by a beige drape.

          Medium shot of Paul bringing a stamp book to Larry.

                          PAUL

           Now, let me show you a mint 1933 airmail. Very rare... and

           very beautiful.

          Larry is seated near a small table, on which Paul puts the book

          down. Paul sits down next to Larry.

                          LARRY

           Yeah.

          Paul picks up a special philatelist magnifying glass and puts it

          in front of the stamp, for Larry to have a better look at it.

                          PAUL

           Look at that. And this plate block is quite unique because

           it has a flaw in the engraving. See if you can see it.

          Larry, who is not interested in philately at all, scratches his

          head.

                          LARRY

           Uh, it's hard for me.

                          PAUL

           Actually I'll give you a little hint. Right down here in

           the corner.

                          LARRY

           That tiny thing there ?

                          PAUL

           Interesting, yeah.

                          LARRY

           Ah, you have a really...

                          PAUL

           That makes it quite valuable, you see. And I just got a

           commemorative set of issues that are going to be quite

           valuable, too.

          He picks up a transparent envelope inside which are several

          stamps.

                          LARRY

           Yes.

                          PAUL

           Look at the color, right there. All these are gonna become

           a real f...

          Larry stands up.

                          LARRY

           Well, listen... we're probably keeping you up, right ?

                          PAUL

           Oh, no-no-no. This is wonderful.

                          LARRY

           I should be going.

                          PAUL

           What do you do, if I may ask ?

                          LARRY

           Me ? I'm in book publishing. I work up at Harper's.

                          PAUL

           Are you really ?

                          LARRY

           Yeah.

                          PAUL

           I own an old, uh, cinema. Having it redone.

                          LARRY

           Oh.

                          PAUL

           Used to have a string of three, but, you know, business is

           not what it used to be.

          He picks up some more stamps from the table.

                          PAUL

           Now, look at these presidentials. Look at the color work.

           Even the perforations are still intact.

                          LARRY

           Where's Carol ?

                          PAUL

           All the...

                          LARRY

           Because I should really be going, actually.

                          PAUL

           Oh, really ?

                          LARRY

           Yeah. I mean, so, we...

          In the background, behind Larry, we see Carol and Lilian entering

          the room.

                          LILLIAN

           Coffee's ready !

                          LARRY

           Oh, coffee. I forgot coffee.

          He turns around to face the women.

           PAUL (voice over)

           Good. We can get back to this later. Come on in.

          We see Paul's hand on Larry's shoulder, pushing him toward the

          centre of the room.

          A little later.

          Full shot of the room. They are all seated around a low table,

          Larry and Carol on the sofa, Paul and Lilian on two armchairs.

          They've just finished their coffee.

                          LILLIAN

           Well, we've never had any children, but it's easy to

           empathize. Oh, um, uh, what college does your son attend ?

                          CAROL

           Brown.

                          LILLIAN

           Oh.

                          PAUL

           Nice color.

          They all laugh.

                          LILLIAN

           Paul never attended college. He's self-made.

                          PAUL

           Always regretted it. I think knowledge is the second most

           important thing. First is health, then knowledge, then

           money.

          Larry puts his cup down on the low table.

                          LARRY

           You know, it's amazing how time, we,... we'll just...

                          LILLIAN

           And, do you work ?

          Larry stands up.

                          CAROL

           Huh ? Do I ?

                          LILLIAN

           Yes.

          Larry looks at Carol and sits back on the sofa.

                          CAROL

           Oh, well, I actually, um, I used to work at an ad agency,

           but that was many years ago.

          The camera moves closer to Carol and Larry.

                          CAROL

           But... You know, I've been seriously thinking of starting a

           little restaurant. But, well, Larry, he's trying to talk me

           out of it.

                          LARRY

           Oh, she's a great cook, though, really. Her duck and fennel

           omelette on a bed of scallops and Hollandaise sauce with

           truffles and sweetbreads'll make you snap into a fetal

           position and have you in bed screaming for a month.

                          CAROL

           He loves to tease me, but actually, he really loves exotic

           food.

                          LILLIAN

           My weakness is any rich dessert, cream, butter, anything

           with fat.

                          CAROL

           Oh, really ? Oh well, let... listen... I'll fix you a

           dessert that'll make your eyeballs roll up. You'll have to

           exercise for a month to work it off.

                          LILLIAN

           Yeah.

           PAUL (voice over)

           We're going to Le Cirque for our anniversary.

                          CAROL

           No, really ?

          The camera moves around, away from Larry and Carol, to Paul.

           LILLIAN (voice over)

           Yes. Twenty-eight years. November.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Really ?

                          PAUL

           Well, what do you buy the woman who buys everything ?

          The camera moves around backward, away from Paul and back to Larry

          and Carol.

                          LILLIAN

           We already have twin cemetery plots.

                          LARRY

           Well, it's... I always think a Bentley is in good taste.

           You know, or you can go the route that I went with her. On

           her twentieth, I got her some very lovely handkerchiefs.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. Oh no. But, you know, they had my initials on them.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, it was a very, very high-class item. I didn't even

           know her size. I'm going over.

          Carol bursts out laughing.

          Black screen. Actually, we are in :

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Carol and Larry's apartment is quite different from the one we've

          just left. It is the apartment of a couple of New-York

          intellectuals, with nice, artistic furniture. We hear a door

          opening.

                          LARRY

           Jesus, couldn't you keep the conversation going a little

           longer in there ?

          Lights are switched on.

          Full shot. We see only part of the hall, the camera being in a

          corridor, and the walls of the corridor concealing part of the

          hall.

          Carol enters the apartment, and Larry holds the door for her.

                          LARRY

           I was signaling you frantically.

          Larry closes the door.

                          CAROL

           I was just trying to be neighborly.

                          LARRY

           Neighborly ? If this guy showed me his stamp collection one

           more time... I mean, my favorite thing in life is to, you

           know, look at canceled postage.

          The camera follows Larry walking in the corridor toward :

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Actually there are two large beds in the bedroom, the room being

          divided by a partition set between the two beds. The partition is

          only a half wall. There is a opening, without door, at each end of

          the partition, to go from one section of the room to the other.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Oh, come on, Larry. It was sweet. They, you know, they're

           looking forward to their anniversary.

          Medium shot of Larry taking his jacket off. He puts it on a chair.

                          LARRY

           Oh, and I'm looking forward to seeing that Bob Hope movie.

           I don't know why they put it on so late.

          The camera turns back to the corridor and Carol, still in the

          front hall.

                          CAROL

           You know, do you think that's gonna happen to us ?

           LARRY (voice over)

           What ?

          Carol walks in the corridor, toward the bedroom.

                          CAROL

           Well, that we'll become like them ? You know, just another

           dull aging couple, you know, with our little walks, you

           know...

          She walks into the bedroom.

           LARRY (voice over)

           We are a dull aging couple.

                          CAROL

           Our TV, our lox and bagels. And... and our twin cemetery

           plots ?

          Larry is seated on his bed. Carol looks at some pills bottles on

          the night table.

                          LARRY

           No, we should be as lucky as them. To, you know, to be in

           their physical shape, at their age ? They look great. Did

           you see the dumbbells this guy lifts ? If I lifted

           dumbbells like those, I would get a hernia the size of the

           San Andrea's Fault.

                          CAROL

           How often do you think they make love ?

          She goes out of the main part of the room, and the camera follows

          her.

          She sits down on the other bed and starts taking her shoes off.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Oh, you know, probably more than we do, in their shape. You

           know, I'm sure as much as once a week.

                          CAROL

           Larry ?

           LARRY (voice over)

           I'm exhausted. What ?

                          CAROL

           Do you still find me attractive ?

           LARRY (voice over)

           Of course. What kind of question is that ? Of course I do.

          Carol stands up from the bed and moves across the room. The

          camera, still located in the main part of the room, follows Carol,

          so we don't actually see her walking, but we see the partition and

          the large clock on it.

           CAROL (voice over from behind the partition)

           Yeah, but we're not turning into a pair of comfortable old

           shoes, are we ? Do you think ?

          Carol reappears on the other side of the partition.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Never comfortable.

                          CAROL

           No ?

          Larry's head appears in the forefront of the shot. He is still

          seated on the bed.

                          LARRY

           I don't think you have to worry about that.

          MARKET PLACE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Long shot on a large outdoor antique market place in New-York.

          The camera pans along the stands in the market, showing sellers

          and customers.

           LARRY (voice over)

           How you guys doing ?

           SY (voice over)

           We're fine.

           MARILYN (voice over)

           We're good.

           SY (voice over)

           We like that. We're gonna get this one.

           MARILYN (voice over)

           That's very nice, actually.

           LARRY (voice over)

           So, actually...

           MARILYN (voice over)

           Listen, are we going to see you at Elaine's Thursday ?

           CAROL (voice over)

           Oh, no. Thursday's our Wagner opera.

          Medium shot on a stand around which Larry, Carol, Sy and Marilyn

          are standing. Sy and Marilyn are a couple about the same age as

          Carol and Larry.

                          MARILYN

           Uh...hum. You know... Ted's coming to Elaine's with us.

                          CAROL

           Ted.

                          MARILYN

           Yeah.

                          CAROL

           How is Ted ?

                          MARILYN

           He's... he seems to be doing well. I mean, I... I actually

           think he's glad... I think he's glad he's divorced.

                          SY

           Well, I don't think he's... no, he's not doing... Come on,

           he's not doing well at all. He's not used to it.

                          MARILYN

           Well he looks... I think he looks, you know, like he's

           glad.

          Sy looks at some of the antique displayed on the stand.

                          SY

           Yeah, yeah. This.

                          LARRY

           So what do you want to do ? you guys gonna browse, or...

                          SY

           No, we're gonna go to a movie.

                          MARILYN

           Yeah, we're gonna go see Double indemnity.

                          CAROL

           Oh, really ?

                          MARILYN

           Yeah.

                          SY

           Why don't you come with us ?

                          MARILYN

           It starts in a little while.

          MOVIE THEATER - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Full shot of the screen of the theater, on which the film Double

          Indemnity is shown. And under the screen, in the dark, the back

          of some of the spectator's heads.

          This film is a very famous 1944 film directed by Billy Wilder, and

          referred by the Library of Congress as one of the hundred best

          films of the Twentieth Century. The term double indemnity refers

          to a clause in certain life insurance policies that doubles the

          payout in cases when death is caused by certain accidental means.

           BARTON KEYES (played by Edward G. Robinson)

           I'd have the police after her so fast, it'd make her head

           spin. They'd put her through the wringer. And brother, the

           things they would squeeze out.

           WALTER NEFF (played by Fred MacMurray)

           They haven't got a single thing to go on, Keyes.

                          BARTON KEYES

           Oh, not too much, I guess. Just twenty-six year

           experience... All the percentage there is, and this hunk of

           concrete in my stomach.

          The third character in the sequence, Phyliss Dietrichson, played

          by Barbara Stanwyck, is half-hiding behind a wall.

          NEW-YORK - LARRY'S RESIDENCE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Full shot of the street, where Larry's apartment building is

          located. The camera is set near the entrance of the building, and

          Carol and Larry are walking toward us.

                          CAROL

           God, that movie was great, wasn't it ?

                          LARRY

           Yeah, I... I... it was one of my favorites.

                          CAROL

           I loved it.

                          LARRY

           It just... they were all so wonderful, in the picture.

                          CAROL

           You know, who could we fix Ted up with ? I mean, there must

           be somebody in your office.

                          LARRY

           Ted ?

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           Well, I don't know. Ted... I always thought Ted had a crush

           on you.

                          CAROL

           Me ?

          She laughs. They have reached their building. The camera turns

          around to follows them inside the building. Larry puts his hand on

          Carol's back to guide her inside the building. We see an ambulance

          revolving light reflected in the glass door of the building.

                          LARRY

           Yeah. Why are you so stunned ? I think that...

                          CAROL

           Please. I mean, you know, I adore him, but you know, he's

           like a girlfriend to me.

                          LARRY

           Uh. Now he's divorced, you know ?

                          CAROL

           Do I detect a note of jealousy ?

          The camera is still on the sidewalk near the entrance of the

          building and we see Carol and Larry walking toward the elevators.

          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT

          A short black screen, which actually is just a close shot on the

          outer door of the elevator. This door slides open, and we get a

          medium shot of Larry and Carol inside the elevator.

          They seem surprised by what they see on the landing. There is a

          gathering of neighbors, which we don't yet see. But we hear their

          voices.

           NEIGHBOR (voice over)

           I had to come up here and call nine-one-one.

           ANOTHER NEIGHBOR (voice over)

           So what's the trouble ?

                          ANOTHER NEIGHBOR

           Oh, is that the-that the E.M.S.

           ANOTHER NEIGHBOR (voice over)

           That guy's so excited.

           ANOTHER NEIGHBOR (voice over)

           The doctor and the E.M.S.

          The camera follows Larry walking toward the group of neighbors.

          Paul's door is wide open.

                          LARRY

           What's the matter ? What's going on ? What happened ?

          He is answered by a tall male neighbor.

                          TALL NEIGHBOR

           She had a heart attack.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Oh my God !

                          TALL NEIGHBOR

           Sh-She's dead.

          The camera turns around to show us inside the apartment. There is

          a stretcher standing in the corridor. On the stretcher, a body -

          Lilian's body - is covered by a white sheet. Three men are

          standing near the stretcher, one of them wearing green gloves and

          writing on a clipboard, another one carrying a black leather case

          (he is evidently a doctor).

           LARRY (voice over)

           She-she's dead ?

           CAROL (voice over)

           Dead ?

           NEIGHBOR (voice over)

           They're giving Mr. House a sedative right now. He's running

           around like crazy.

          The camera turns back to the tall neighbor standing near the front

          door. A policeman enters the apartment.

                          TALL NEIGHBOR

           I called E.M.S. and they got here as soon as they could,

           but it was too late.

                          LARRY

           Sh-We just met her last night.

          The camera turns back inside the corridor. The doctor is coming

          toward the front door.

           OLD FEMALE NEIGHBOR (voice over)

           Awful, just awful.

           LARRY (voice over)

           What happened ?

                          DOCTOR

           Well, it was a classic coronary. She just went like that.

          The camera turns back toward the group of neighbors.

                          CAROL

           Is there anything we can do ?

                          LARRY

           Oh, my God.

           DOCTOR (voice over)

           You can be good neighbors. You know, we calmed him down,

           uh...

                          LARRY

           Th-Th-Th-The first time we saw them was last night. We just

           met them. W-We had... They invited us in for coffee.

                          TALL NEIGHBOR

           Such a... S... Such a nice lady.

           OLD FEMALE NEIGHBOR

           Nice lady.

           NEIGHBOR WITH A MOUSTACHE

           Sweet person.

          NEW-YORK - LARRY'S RESIDENCE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Full shot on the entrance of Larry's building. Larry and Carol are

          coming out. They are very elegantly dressed, Larry wearing a suit

          and a necktie.

                          CAROL

           God, okay.

                          LARRY

           You look wonderful.

          Paul is coming down the street toward the entrance of the

          building. He is carrying some grocery in a paper bag.

                          CAROL

           Oh, hallo.

                          PAUL

           Hi.

                          CAROL

           Hi, Mr. House, so... sorry.

                          PAUL

           Thank you so much for those wonderful flowers.

          Paul seems very relax. He smiles a lot, which could be surprising,

          when we understand he put his wife in the grave only a couple of

          days ago.

                          CAROL

           Oh.

                          PAUL

           It was quite nice of you.

                          CAROL

           That's... sure.

                          LARRY

           If there's anything we can do. You know, anything you need,

           just tell us and we'll...

                          CAROL

           No, anything. Anything at all. I mean, God, it's just such

           a shock when anyone... It was just so sudden. I mean, she

           seemed so... God, well, healthy.

                          LARRY

           Yeah.

                          PAUL

           She had a heart condition.

                          CAROL

           She did ? She never mentioned it... It... that she was...

                          LARRY

           Ah.

                          PAUL

           She wouldn't have.

                          CAROL

           No. Right. Well...

                          LARRY

           If there's anything we can do.

                          CAROL

           Yeah, anything. Really.

                          LARRY

           You know, if you need anything, if you are lonely, come by.

           You know.

                          PAUL

           Thank you. You know, you owe me a wonderful French dessert.

                          CAROL

           Oh, no, no, no. I know, I haven't forgotten. Believe me, I

           haven't forgotten.

                          PAUL

           Well, have a nice time. You seem all gussied up.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. Oh, I know. We're going to the opera.

                          PAUL

           Oh, enjoy.

                          LARRY

           My favorite, my favorite.

                          PAUL

           Goodnight.

          He walks away toward the entrance of the building, still smiling a

          lot and looking very happy. Carol looks at him with a question on

          her face.

                          LARRY

           Goodnight.

                          CAROL

           Goodnight.

                          LARRY

           Come, we're gonna be late.

          THE METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Long shot on the Met building.

          We hear the music from Wagner's The Flying Dutchman.

          The camera slowly tilts down. We don't see Carol and Larry yet,

          but we hear their voices.

           CAROL (voice over)

           The deal was, I sit through the ice hockey game and you

           watch the whole opera.

          The camera is now on ground level, and we see Carol and Larry

          coming out of the Met.

                          LARRY

           I can't listen to that much Wagner, you know. I start to

           get the urge to conquer Poland.

          They cross the esplanade in front of the Met.

          ELAINE'S RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Elaine's is a cosy place, like there are many around Greenwich

          Village.

          Carol and Larry are eating at Elaine's with Sy, Marilyn and Ted.

          Ted is a quite handsome man in his forties.

          We get a medium full view of the party, with a very mobile camera

          moving around the table and going from one person to another,

          getting closer to one person, then moving slightly away.

                          SY

           I'll tell you something. I think it's weird. I mean, listen

           to this. One night she's having coffee, and the next night

           they are carrying her out in a rubber bag.

                          CAROL

           Oh, I know, I know. And she did not look like she was ready

           to go.

                          TED

           Maybe this guy killed her, you know ? Like, he's got, like,

           a young tootsie stashed someplace, or something.

                          LARRY

           No, no, not this... you gotta, you gotta see this guy. This

           guy gets his jollies from licking the back of postage

           stamps. He's a-a boring old...

                          TED

           Well, I can see that. Yeah, depending on whose picture is

           on the stamp.

                          CAROL

           She never once mentioned that she had a heart condition.

                          LARRY

           Well, what is she gonna say ? Oh, yeah, hello, I'm Mrs.

           House and I have a bad heart.

                          CAROL

           Well, she had no problem telling me about her hysterectomy

           in the first five minutes.

                          SY

           It is much easier to talk about a hysterectomy than it is

           to talk about a heart condition.

                          TED

           You said she liked... she liked eating high cholesterol

           desserts. Is that what you said ?

                          LARRY

           So, she had one too many.

                          CAROL

           No. No ! She wasn't on a diet. We discussed diets.

                          LARRY

           So she wasn't on a diet. But...

                          TED

           This would be a really great way to kill somebody.

                          SY

           How ?

                          TED

           You clog their arteries with whipped cream, chocolate

           mousse, butter. They go like that.

          Carol is laughing very heartily at Ted's joke.

                          SY

          That's great.

                         LARRY

          I like a... It's disgusting.

                         TED

          you know what I mean ?

                         LARRY

          It's disgusting, but a... It's fatal.

                         TED

          Wouldn't that be great ?

                         MARILYN

          I'd like to French-pastry myself to death right now.

                         SY

          I'll help you.

                         MARILYN

          I really would.

                         SY

          All right.

                         MARILYN

          In fact, I'd like another piece of pie, right after this.

          Do I dare ? I like yours better than this.

                         TED

          Are you gonna start a restaurant ? Are you serious about

          that ?

                         MARILYN

          You really should. you're a great cook.

                         TED

          Because, if you do, count me in. I wanna be part of that.

          Really.

                         LARRY

          Really ?

                         MARILYN

          You should.

                         CAROL

          No. Well, I don't know. I mean, you... Are you serious ?

                         TED

          Yeah. Oh, oh, God, it'd be wonderful.

                         LARRY

          What are you encouraging her for ? It's so...

                         TED

          She's great. She's a great cook.

                         LARRY

           I know, but...

                          CAROL

           Well, it's thanks to you, actually. I mean, it was his

           idea. The cooking lessons, so I mean...

                          TED

           Yes, I had...

                          SY

           Yes, but a restaurant is a serious business. I mean, you

           just can't take that lightly. You can't be cavalier about a

           restaurant.

                          CAROL

           I'm not being cavalier about it.

                          LARRY

           Do you know how time-consuming it is ? Yeah. You have to be

           there every night.

                          SY

           Absolutely.

                          LARRY

           You'd be stuck there, you know.

                          TED

           Wait. Look, look.

                          LARRY

           They steal from, if you're not... You gotta be hap...

                          CAROL

           But it's bi... it's what I do. It's-It's what I do, Larry.

                          TED

           She'll cook... She's great. She's-She's a pro. She's a pro.

           She'll be cooking... She'll be cooking in the kitchen. I'll

           be at the front, running the joint like Rick, you know, in

           Casablanca.

                          SY

           It's not that easy.

                          MARILYN

           You do it anyway. Right as well get paid for it.

                          LARRY

           Right. Directs...

                          TED

           I'm set, I'm serious about it. I don't... I mean, it's not

           like a hobby. I mean, it's gotta be a serious thing.

                          SY

           I'll be the first customer.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium shot of Carol coming out of the bathroom. She switches the

          bathroom light off. She is wearing a pink night dress.

          The camera turns toward Larry's bed, in which Larry is already

          lying. He has a book in his hands.

                          LARRY

           You know, I was thinking of fixing Ted up with Helen Dubin.

           You know, I figured they would just, you know, get into an

           argument over penis envy, or something.

                          CAROL

           Oh.

                          LARRY

           The poor guy suffers from it so...

          Carol puts something on the night-table on her side of the bed.

                          CAROL

           Did he seem a little too cheerful ?

          She looks at some pills bottles on the night table.

                          LARRY

           No, he seemed like his regular self to me, but-but, uh,

           when you brought up the notion of the restaurant... the guy

           lit up like Mr. Glowworm.

                          CAROL

           The restaurant ?

          She picks up a hair brush.

                          LARRY

           Yeah. He sees himself as, uh, you know, as Humphrey Bogart

           in Casablanca. I-I see him more as Peter Lorre, wringing

           his hands.

          Carol starts walking toward the other section of the room. The

          camera follows her.

                          CAROL

           No, no, no. No, no, no. I mean, Mr. House, Mr. House.

           Didn't seem a little too cheerful to you ?

           LARRY (voice over)

           Mr. House, our next-door widower ?

          Carol stops in front of a large mirror set on the wall in one

          corner of the room.

                          CAROL

           Yes. Yes. I mean, there's... Well, you know. I mean, didn't

           he seem too compose for a man whose wife just died. Don't

           you think ?

           LARRY (voice over)

           Well, Jesus. What do you want the guy to do, walk down the

           street sobbing hysterically ?

          Carol starts brushing her hair.

                          CAROL

           Well, I don't know. All I know is, they were supposedly

           looking forward to their, you know... anniversary, and,

           and, and, you know, uh-uh, i-i-if... I suddenly dropped

           dead... wouldn't you sob for months, or-or years, if I...

           You know...

           LARRY (voice over)

           Hey, don't make those kind of jokes, okay ? I don't like

           those remarks. And, meanwhile, I'm the guy who needs a

           physical check-up.

                          CAROL

           Oh, I don't know.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Uh, uh.

          Carol walks to a chest of drawers, on top of which she drops the

          hairbrush. Then she switches the lights off in the other section

          of the bedroom, and walks back to the bed.

                          CAROL

           I mean, to me he just seemed a little too perky. You know ?

           Now, suddenly he wants his French desserts, and, Have a

           nice time, you know, at the opera. And, my God, We're

           certainly dressed up. I mean, you know. This guy should be

           a wreck.

          She sits down on her side of the bed, and takes her socks off.

          While talking, Larry puts the book and his glasses on the night-

          table. Carol switches the light off on her night table and gets

          into the bed.

                          LARRY

           Right. Meanwhile, I can't get the-the Flying Dutchman theme

           out of my mind, you know ? Remind me tomorrow to buy up all

           the Wagner records in town and rent a chainsaw.

          He switches the lights off on his bed table. The room is

          completely dark, and we hear the next sentences on a black screen.

                          CAROL

           Helen Dubin's wrong for Ted.

                          LARRY

           Yeah ?

                          CAROL

           She's too mousey.

                          LARRY

           Well, he's a little mousey, too. They could have their

           little rodent time. They can eat cheese together.

          Carol bursts out laughing. The phone starts ringing.

                          LARRY

           Oh, Christ.

          He switches the light back on, puts his glasses on his nose and

          picks up the phone.

                          LARRY

           Hallo ? Yes. Yes, of.... Yes, of course you woke us. You

           know, not everybody's up at one o'clock in the morning

           watching the porn channel. I'll put her on.

          He gives the phone receiver to Carol.

                          CAROL

           Who is it ?

                          LARRY

           Ted. For you.

                          CAROL

           Ted, hi.

          RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium shot of Ted, dressed in a night-gown, and standing near the

          counter of a restaurant. The room is very dark, only lit by a lamp

          on the counter.

                          TED

           I figured out how he killed her and made it look like a

           coronary. He gagged her and tied her to the treadmill, and

           then he turned the exercise program up to the Olympic

           levels.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Carols bursts out laughing.

                          CAROL

           No, no. You know, I mean, I just think this guy is too

           perky. You know, I mean he's not acting like a man whose

           beloved of twenty-eight years died just a few days ago.

          Larry is trying to get the telephone cord, stretched from his

          night-table to the handset hold by Carol, away from his face.

                          LARRY

           Jesus, are you onto that ? My God, I thought you were just

           joking.

                          CAROL

           Yeah, I know.

                          LARRY

           Let me speak to him, all right ?

                          CAROL

           What? Oh. Here. Just a sec. Here's Larr...

          She gives the handset to Larry.

                          LARRY

           Hey, listen. She was not murdered. She... she had a heart

           attack. It was a coronary. There was a doctor there. He

           said to.... He was an old man.

          Medium shot of Ted.

                          TED

           Wait-wait-wait a minute, wait a minute, put Carol back on,

           I called about something else. Listen, I know a great

           location for a restaurant.

          NEW-YORK - A YARD - EXTERIOR DAY

          A yard in the middle of old New-York buildings.

          The camera is located at the inner end of the passage leading from

          the street to the yard. We gets a full shot of Carol and Ted

          coming from the street and walking toward us and the yard.

                          TED

           Hah, look at this. Isn't this great ?

                          CAROL

           Well, it's dark.

                          TED

           Aren't these walls great ? A cave, you know, like you have

           to go through a little cave.

                          CAROL

           Oh, I see.

                          TED

           And then you come out, to this here.

          They have reached the yard. The camera moves back to get a medium

          shot of them both.

                          CAROL

           Oh, look at this though. It's really so beautiful.

                          TED

           Yeah. Isn't it great ?

                          CAROL

           But... it's kind out of the way for a restaurant, isn't

           it ?

                          TED

           No, no... that's the appeal. That's just the appeal,

           because it's... it's, I mean it's so romantic... tucked

           away back in here like this.

          The camera leaves Carol and Ted in the middle of the yard and

          moves up and around to show us the old building around the yard.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Yeah.

           TED (voice over)

           And, you don't want street traffic. You want...

           CAROL (voice over)

           No.

           TED (voice over)

           you want a little out of the way spot that people hear

           about and lovers go to.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Yeah.

           TED (voice over)

           It takes months to take a reservation, you know ? Very few

           tables.

          The camera moves down to ground level to give us a better view of

          the yard. It does look a bit neglected, with weeds growing in

          between the stones covering the ground. There are some trees and a

          small out-of-order fountain with a statue on top of it.

           CAROL (voice over)

           You know, you've really thought this out.

           TED (voice over)

           Oh, well, I used to come here all the time with-with July,

           when we were married.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Uh uh. Right.

          The camera moves back to Carol and Ted.

                          TED

           Used to walk around here. Really beautiful at night. It's

           gorgeous at night.

                          CAROL

           It's beautiful, I bet.

                          TED

           I used to think, What am I doing here with July ? We don't

           love each other any more, you know ? It made the moment

           doubly poignant.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium shot of the corridor, showing the front door. Paul opens

          the front door. Larry and Carol are standing in the doorway. Larry

          is wearing a necktie and Carol is carrying a large tray.

                          PAUL

           Hi. How are you ?

                          CAROL

           Hi. How are you ?

                          PAUL

           Oh, my...

                          CAROL

           These are my floating islands. I hope you like meringue.

          Paul takes the tray from Carol's hands.

                          PAUL

           I love it. Come on in, come on in.

                          CAROL

           Well, okay.

                          PAUL

           This is unbelievable.

          Carol enters the apartment, followed by Larry.

                          CAROL

           I know, it's just...

                          PAUL

           Did you do it ?

          Larry closes the door behind him.

                          CAROL

           I did do it. I told you. Anyway, this has got... this is

           vanilla sauce here and I put little chocolate truffles.

                          PAUL

           Well, come on in.

                          CAROL

           Do you like chocolate truffles ?

                          PAUL

           Would you share it with me ?

                          LARRY

           Oh, no. She made these just for you. This is...

                          CAROL

           Oh, well...

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          They all enter the living room.

                          PAUL

           No, no, no, it's too much for one. I'll I make some coffee.

           Please.

                          LARRY

           They're only half a dozen.

                          CAROL

           No, no, no. Look, I'll make the coffee. That'd be better.

           Let me make it.

                          PAUL

           Oh, you've already done so much.

                          CAROL

           No, no. I insist, I insist. Go on, sit down, relax.

          She takes the tray from Paul's hands.

                          PAUL

           Aren't you nice.

                          CAROL

           Enjoy yourself, you've been through enough.

          She walks to the kitchen, carrying the tray.

                          LARRY

           She worked on those for... How're you holding up ?

                          PAUL

           Oh, I don't know. I was thinking after a while. I'd get

           away from here. From this place and all its memories.

                          LARRY

           Uh uh, so you have someone to go with, or are you...

                          PAUL

           I have a brother in Florida.

                          LARRY

           Oh, really ?

                          PAUL

           I'm hoping he can get away for a while.

                          LARRY

           Good. It's a good idea.

                          PAUL

           Do you like snorkeling ?

                          LARRY

           Snorkeling ? No, no. I get nervous when brightly colored

           fish are staring at me face to face, you know.

                          PAUL

           Hey, I've got some stamps I wanted to show you.

          He turns to his desk to pick up a stamp album.

                          LARRY

           Oh, stamps. Well, that's...

                          PAUL

           Come on, look at these.

          The camera pans to the kitchen.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

          The conversation between Paul and Larry keeps going in the living-

          room but we can't understand the words.

          Carol puts water in the glass jar of the coffee machine. She puts

          the lid on the jar and turns around to put the jar in the machine.

          She looks in the coffee plastic container and notices there is no

          coffee inside. She bends down and opens the cupboard door. Not

          finding any coffee in the cupboard, she closes it, stands up and

          turns around to look inside the cupboard above the sink. She

          closes it, and bends down to look inside the cupboard next to the

          dishwasher. She seems surprised by something and pauses. Then she

          takes a copper funeral urn from inside the cupboard. She stands up

          and takes the lid off the urn. She looks inside the urn and closes

          it. She seems a bit shocked and bends down to put the urn back

          inside the cupboard. Then she stands up and looks absently around

          her.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          A little later.

          Full shot of the room. Larry and Carol are sitting next to each

          other on the sofa. Carol is drinking coffee from a cup, and Larry

          is staring, with his arms crossed on his chest, looking a little

          bored. Paul is sitting on an armchair and eating the floating

          islands from a plate he is holding in his other hand.

                          PAUL

           This is very delicious.

                          CAROL

           Thank you.

                          PAUL

           You are an artist.

                          CAROL

           Well, thanks very much. Uh, was it a large... funeral ?

                          PAUL

           Oh, no. We had... very few friends, no family.

          The camera moves closer to Larry and Carol.

                          CAROL

           Right. Just a simple affair, uh ? Well, they're the best,

           aren't they ?

                          PAUL

           Yeah.

                          CAROL

           I guess. Anyway, then you're laid the rest, and, you know,

           I was just... where, um, where are the twin cemetery

           plots ? We... because, we were thinking that that was just

           such a romantic idea. Weren't we, Larry ? You know ?

           Larry ? You remember when we were talking about the twin

           cemetery plots and, you know, how kind of romantic that

           is ? Remember ?

          Larry looks at his wife. He has a little difficulty to come back

          into a conversation he wasn't following.

                          LARRY

           Uh-huh. Yes, yes. We were. We were spending the eternity

           with the beloved. I sound like... I sound like one of those

           guys, now.

          The camera pans to Paul. He has put his plate on the low table.

                          PAUL

           Yes.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Yes but, I was just wondering where, um, where is the

           cemetery ?

                          PAUL

           Oh, it's... uh, in... uh, it's in Nyack. We used to summer

           there occasionally.

          He wipes his lips with his napkin.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium shot. Larry enters the apartment, followed by Carol, who

          then walks in front of him.

                          LARRY

           What was all that stuff about twin cemetery plots ?

                          CAROL

           Listen, Larry.

                          LARRY

           You know ? I mean, we-we never discussed it at all, but I

           knew that you were trying to tell me something, so I picked

           up on it quickly.

          He closes the door behind him.

                          CAROL

           Listen.

                          LARRY

           But I... You know, we...

                          CAROL

           Okay, just... I was in the kitchen okay ? And I was making

           the coffee. There were no beans, so, I was looking in his

           cupboards, just to see, you know, and I came across this

           urn, okay ? And I opened it and there were ashes in it.

                          LARRY

           Ashes ? Funeral ashes ? Did you wash your hands ?

                          CAROL

           Larry, he had her cremated !

                          LARRY

           How did you know it was her, for Christ's sake ? They were

           ashes. What, did they resemble Mrs. House ?

          He walks into the living-room.

                          CAROL

           Oh, and who else would it be, okay ?

          Larry picks up his jacket from the back of an armchair.

                          LARRY

           Anybody. Could it be, an associate, an old relative, his

           accountant, his cat. Who knows ?

           CAROL (voice over)

           Right, right. Hidden, uh ? Hidden away ?

                          LARRY

           What do you mean? Th-th-the guy didn't do anything.

          The camera pans across the hall toward the kitchen. She has a box

          (cereals ?) in her hand.

                          CAROL

           Look, Larry. All I know is he lied, okay ? He lied.

          She puts the box in a cupboard above the sink. Then she picks up

          the phone on the wall.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Look. Maybe-maybe-maybe he is embarrassed. Maybe he didn't

           want to spend eternity next to the beloved, so he-he told

           us that-uh... You know, what's the difference ? Who are you

           calling ?

                          CAROL

           Ted !

          The camera pans back to the living-room and Larry. Larry walks

          behind a partition, still holding his jacket. The camera follows

          his movement.

                          LARRY

           Oh, Jesus. Leave the guy alone. You know, he-he... he's a

           poor widower, he wants to go on a vacation or something.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Yeah. Where ? Oh, I know where, ah ah. Snorkeling, right ?

           Ah ah.

          Larry puts the jacket on something we don't see because it is

          hidden by the partition. Then he picks up a brochure on a low

          table and walks toward the kitchen. The camera follows him.

                          LARRY

           So what ? Different strokes. You know, he has fun, uh,

           sitting at the bottom of the water, face to face with

           squid.

          Carol is still standing in the kitchen, with the phone handset on

          her ear.

                          CAROL

           Oh, I know. I know. What about this ? What if they had a

           big insurance policy, or something like that, huh ?

                          LARRY

           Too much Double Indemnity, you know ?

                          CAROL

           Hu-Huh.

           (speaking on the phone)

           Hi. Yeah. Hi, it's me. Listen, we were just in our

           neighbor's apartment, right ?

          Larry walks away from the kitchen.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. And get this. I came across an urn with ashes in

           it. Only he says he had his wife buried.

          TED'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Ted is lying on a large comfortable sofa, sipping beer from a

          bottle.

                          TED

           That's what you do if you don't want an autopsy. You don't

           want something discovered, you know ? Like-like poison.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Carol is still standing up, the telephone handset stuck between

          her ear and her shoulder.

                          CAROL

           Mm. Right. They'd have detected poison, wouldn't they ?

          TED'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                          TED

           Uh, I don't know. There's a lot of different kinds of

           exotic poisons, you know ?

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Full shot of the kitchen, seen from the hall. Carol is still

          standing up but now she holding the phone handset with her hand.

                          CAROL

           Yeah, but why would he... Why would he be lying ? I mean,

           why-why would he lie at all ?

          Larry walks back into the kitchen.

                          LARRY

           Jesus, you're up to poisons already. You guys are slipping

           into a mad obsession.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. Oh, would you do that ? Because... That'd be great.

           Because, you know, I'm not good at that kind of thing,

           okay ? All right. Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later. Okay,

           bye.

          She puts the phone back on its hook on the wall

                          LARRY

           Let's go to bed. Could we go to bed, now ?

                          CAROL

           Hey, I'm not tired.

                          LARRY

           What do you mean, You're not tired ?

                          CAROL

           You know, Ted's gonna check with the funeral home,

           tomorrow.

                          LARRY

           Great.

                          CAROL

           You know what I mean ? I mean, I don't understand why

           you're not, not more fascinated with this. We could be

           living next door to a murderer, Larry.

                          LARRY

           Well, New York is a melting pot. You know, get used to it.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Later in the night.

          Medium shot on the bed. Larry is asleep, but Carol is not. She

          moves in the bed, and then sits up. She turns around, pats her

          pillow, and tries to lie back on her side. But she sits up again,

          looking around the room. Eventually, she gets out of the bed.

          She walks around the bed in the dark, and switches on the lights

          in the corridor. The camera follows her in the corridor.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Carol switches the lights on in the hall, then she looks into the

          peephole in the front door.

                          CAROL

           Oh my God !

          The camera turns around toward the corridor. Larry is getting out

          of the bedroom, putting his slippers on.

                          LARRY

           Hey, are you okay ?

          Carol walks in the corridor toward him.

                          CAROL

           Larry. Larry, I heard a noise. I-I-I heard a noise in the

           hallway, so I just... I... You know, I-I looked and I

           think... I think Mr. House was getting on the elevator.

          Larry hops toward her, still trying to put his slippers on. She

          backs up and they are now both in the front hall.

                          LARRY

           Yeah ? You're sure ?

                          CAROL

           Yeah, you know, I was... I'm-I'm... almost certain that it

           was him.

                          LARRY

           So-So-So what ?

                          CAROL

           Just, you know... I mean, who else could it be ?

                          LARRY

           So what ? It's not a crime. He can get on the elevator.

                          CAROL

           I know. I know. But wh-who would it be at one-thirty in the

           morning ?

                          LARRY

           Oh, Jesus. I was in a deep sleep. What-What's the

           difference ?

                          CAROL

           But, you mean, you know how we're always complaining about

           living on the geriatric floor. Do you know what I'm

           saying ? A joke ?

          While Larry is answering her, Carol opens the front door and peeks

          into the hallway.

                          LARRY

           All right, so it was Mr. House. So he got on the elevator.

           It's not a felony. The guy pays rent. He's entitled. I

           mean, what... Can you go back to bed ? This is crazy. You

           woke me up out of a deep sleep. I gotta get up early

           tomorrow morning.

          Carol closes the door, and walks toward the kitchen. The camera

          follows her.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Carol looks through a notebook.

                          CAROL

           I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna ring him up. I'm gonna

           ring his apartment. I'm gonna see if he's home.

           LARRY (voice over)

           You're gonna ring Mr. House, now ?

                          CAROL

           Yes, because this is really...

           LARRY (voice over)

           What are you talking about ?

                          CAROL

           It's very sus...

          Larry joins Carol when she already has the handset in her hand.

          But she succeeds in dialing Paul's number.

                          LARRY

           Don't ring Mr... What are you doing ? No, don't ring...

                          CAROL

           Let me just... Larry, don't. Wait.

                          LARRY

           Don't ring Mr. house. This is a widower. Leave the poor guy

           alone. You're crazy. Stop it.

          Carol listens to the phone.

                          CAROL

           That's one ring.

                          LARRY

           So you saw him go out. It's not a-not a crime.

                          CAROL

           Okay, two rings. He's not there, yet.

          Larry takes the handset from Carol's hand.

                          LARRY

           Give me this. Give me this.

                          CAROL

           What are you doing ?

                          LARRY

           Look, if you want to find out if somebody left, just call

           downstairs. Call the-the-the person at the desk.

                          CAROL

           All right, I'll call. Just keep ringing.

                          LARRY

           Ask if someone went out.

                          CAROL

           Keep ringing.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, um. Sure, I'm gonna keep ringing. You got it.

          While Carol walks out of the kitchen, Larry puts the phone back on

          its hook on the wall.

                          CAROL

           Oh, man.

          Carol walks into the hall. The camera follows her.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

           LARRY (voice over)

           This is insane. What's gotten into you ?

          Carol picks up the building internal telephone handset from the

          wall.

                          CAROL

           I don't know. What is he doing ? Where is this guy at one-

           thirty in the morning ? You know what I'm saying ?

           LARRY (voice over)

           It's not your business. He can go any place he wants.

           CAROL (in the phone)

           Hallo ? Yes, hallo. This is Mrs. Lipton. Yes. Did anybody

           just leave the building ? I'm just... hmm. You're sure ?

           You're sure no one ? No, okay. All right. Yes. Thank you.

          While she was talking on the phone, the camera has moved toward

          Larry, standing at the entrance of the kitchen.

                          LARRY

           Okay. Are you happy ?

          We hear the noise of the phone being put back on its hook.

                          CAROL

           I don't believe this. Man, I don't get it.

          Larry joins his wife in the hall.

                          LARRY

           Now, can we back to bed ?

                          CAROL

           No.

                          LARRY

           For crying out loud, it's no big deal. You're making a

           mystery where nothing exists.

                          CAROL

           Just let me think about this a second. Okay, I got it.

           Wait. I know, it... No, wait. Listen to me. Larry...

           Listen. He got on the elevator, okay ?

                          LARRY

           You know, I'm gonna...

                          CAROL

           No, wait. No, no, listen to this. No.

                          LARRY

           I wanna go to sleep. I don't want to be standing here in

           the middle of the night.

                          CAROL

           I know. Larry, he got on the elevator and he took it to the

           basement.

                          LARRY

           Oh, great ! Great ! So what ? Now, what've you got ?

                          CAROL

           He has a car, right ? He's got the garage door key, he

           opened... he could... he has the...

                          LARRY

           So what ? So what ?

                          CAROL

           What do you mean, so what ? He's...

                          LARRY

           What's the big deal ? So, the next-door neighbor went out

           in the middle of the night and took his car. So, he went

           someplace.

                          CAROL

           All right. So, I'm right, though.

          She starts walking back to the bedroom. Larry follows her. The

          camera remains in the front hall, filming them.

                          LARRY

           That's all.

                          CAROL

           I mean, I'm right.

                          LARRY

           I mean, so you're right. So big deal.

                          CAROL

           Yes, he isn't in his apartment.

                          LARRY

           But this kind of right is gonna put us in the toilet. So,

           you're right. You're suspicious.

                          CAROL

           Yeah, that's right.

                          LARRY

           It says more about your mind that about him.

                          CAROL

           What about your rigidity ? How about that ?

                          LARRY

           Get into bed. Get into bed.

                          CAROL

           How about that point ?

                          LARRY

           You're so... What's wrong with you ? Jesus !

          They disappear in the bedroom.

          NEW-YORK - LARRY'S RESIDENCE STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Long shot on the crossroad between the street where Larry's

          residence is located and another street. Carol is crossing the

          street. She stops walking while on the crosswalk. The camera zooms

          on her and we see an expression of surprise on her face.

          Reverse angle long shot on the entrance of Larry's building. Paul

          comes out of the building. The camera zooms on him : he looks

          around him as if afraid to be followed.

          Reverse angle shot on Carol looking at him from a distance. She

          enters her building. She smiles to the attendant on duty.

                          CAROL

           Hi !

          LARRY'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY

          Full shot of Carol walking down the staircase leading to the

          basement. We see her through the glass panel of a heavy metal

          safety door. She opens the door.

                          CAROL

           Jack ?

          The camera follows Carol to a reverse angle shot showing the

          workshop of Jack, the factotum caretaker of the building. With a

          screwdriver and a plier in his hands, he is working on something

          we don't see.

                          CAROL

           Jack, do you think you could come upstairs today, because I

           got a leak in the kitchen ?

                          JACK

           Well, yeah. Yeah.

                          CAROL

           You can ?

                          JACK

           Sure.

                          CAROL

           Well, but, it will be this afternoon.

                          JACK

           But I... I got...

                          CAROL

           All right, you're not gonna go now ?

                          JACK

           I'll be back in about a minute.

          Jack walks out of his workshop and along one of the basement

          corridors.

                          CAROL

           In a minute.

                          JACK

           Okay, just wait a second. I'll be right back.

          The camera follows Jack walking away.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Yeah. Okay. All right. Oh, God.

          The camera turns around to a reverse angle shot on Carol, still in

          the workshop. She looks around, apparently looking for something.

          She peeks through the door of the workshop, to make sure Jack is

          not coming back too early. Carol rushes to a key-box on the wall,

          into which there is a spare key for every apartment in the

          building. She selects a key, takes it out of the box and puts it

          in her pocket. Then she leaves the workshop toward the staircase.

          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR DAY

          Full shot of the hallway. Carol comes out of the elevator, and

          looks around her. She walks back and forth in the hallway, before

          coming back to Paul's apartment door, just in front of the

          elevator. She opens the door with the key she has just stolen in

          Jack's workshop.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY

          Full shot of the front door, seen from the living room. The front

          corridor is completely dark. The door opens and Carol walks in.

          She closes the door behind her.

          Carol walks toward the living room, and the light coming from the

          windows.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

          Carol crosses the kitchen. She kneels down to look into the

          cupboard where she had found the funeral urn. Apparently the urn

          is not there anymore.

          NEW YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Long shot on a crosswalk in New-York. Paul is crossing the street.

          The camera zooms on Paul. He has almost crossed the street, but he

          suddenly stops a few feet from the next sidewalk. He feels his

          jacket : apparently he has forgotten something in his apartment.

          He turns around and starts walking back on the crosswalk.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

          Carol is still looking in all the cupboards of the kitchen. She

          gets out of the kitchen into the living-room.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          The camera pans around the room, following Carol, who looks inside

          every piece of furniture in the room.

          NEW YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of Paul walking along the sidewalk, going back toward

          his apartment.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Carol has picked up a few papers from a low table, and is looking

          at them. She puts her hand into her trouser pocket to get her

          glasses out. She puts her glasses on to have a better look at the

          documents she has found.

          LARRY'S BUILDING - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

          Through the window of the lobby, we get a full shot of Paul coming

          toward the entrance of the building. An attendant rushes to open

          the door for him.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Carol is sitting at the desk. She has opened the drawer of the

          desk and is looking through its content. She takes an Air France

          ticket folder out of the drawer and looks inside it. Then she

          picks up another one.

          LARRY'S BUILDING - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of Paul entering the elevator.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Carol closes the drawer of the desk. She stands up and picks up

          the phone from the desk and starts dialing a number.

          TED'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Full shot of the room, which is quite wide. Ted is seated at his

          desk, and the shot is taken from the other side of the room,

          showing Ted's back. The phone rings. Ted picks it up.

                          TED

           Hallo ?

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium close shot of Carol speaking on the phone.

                          CAROL

           Ted... I'm in his apartment.

          LARRY'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium close shot of Paul inside the cabin of the elevator. He

          gives a quick look up to the floor numbers above the door.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Same shot of Carol on the phone.

                          CAROL

           The urn is missing. It's gone. Yeah, I think it might have

           been. He had this satchel last night. He was carrying this

           bag, and I think that might have been what he had in his

           satchel.

          TED'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Close shot of Ted's back. He is still seated at his desk and

          talking on the phone

                          TED

           Listen, I'd get out of there right away, if I were you.

          The camera moves around Ted, showing the typewriter he is typing

          on.

                          TED

           No, no, no. Go, go, go. We'll do... We'll talk more from

           your apartment.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Same shot of Carol on the phone.

                          CAROL

           He's not going snorkeling with his brother. He's got two

           tickets to Paris, and he's got reservations at the Georges

           Cinq hotel with a woman named Helen Moss.

          She turns around, because she feels she heard a noise in the

          landing hallway.

          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR DAY

          One of Paul's neighbor is standing in the hallway, waiting for the

          elevator. He's got some documents in his hand. The elevator dings

          and the door opens. Paul comes out.

                          NEIGHBOR

           Oh. Hi. How are you ?

                          PAUL

           Good morning. How are you ?

          Paul has his key in his hand and is ready to open his apartment

          door.

                          NEIGHBOR

           Good. You got the notice on the... Uh, maintenance

           increase ?

          Paul turns around to look at the neighbor.

                          PAUL

           No. When did that happen ?

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Close shot on Carol, whispering in the phone and looking toward

          the front door.

                          CAROL

           I'm gonna look around and see what else I can dig up here,

           okay ? Yeah. I'm telling you, this is just... Ted, I-I'm

           just dizzy with freedom. This is just... uh, this is just

           the craziest thing I've ever done.

          TED'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Close-up shot on the ashtray, where a cigarette is burning slowly.

          The camera pans to a close-up shot on Paul's face, still on the

          phone.

                          TED

           Yes, it's crazy. But soon, we'll be too old to do anything

           crazy. Go, leave, leave, leave.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Carol puts the phone down on the desk. She stands and turns around

          when she hears the front door opening.

          Black screen shot on the front door in the dark of the corridor,

          then the camera quickly spins around to show Carol, standing in

          the living-room, with a frightened look on her face. She walks

          away from the room. The camera spins back to the front door, which

          opens. Paul enters and switches the lights on. He closes the front

          door, and walks along the corridor to the living-room.

          Carol walks into the kitchen from the living-room.

          The camera pans to Paul, looking for something on his desk. He

          looks through all the documents scattered on the desk.

          The camera pans back to Carol, hiding in the kitchen, then back to

          Paul.

          Paul opens both his hands in a gesture of despair : apparently, he

          hasn't found what he was looking for. He starts walking across the

          room, and the camera pans back to Carol in the kitchen. She rushes

          out of the kitchen.

          The camera remains at the same spot, and we see Paul in the

          living-room, still looking for whatever he is missing. He walks

          out of the living-room through the kitchen.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Paul enters the room, looking in the inner pocket of his jacket.

          He walks around the room, and opens a closet. He looks through the

          hanging clothes, and finds a few documents in one of the jackets.

          He closes the closet, and starts looking through the documents he

          has found. He puts them inside the inner pocket of his jacket. He

          starts walking out of the room, when the phone rings. He stops and

          picks up the phone receiver on one of the night-tables.

                          PAUL

           Hallo.

          Medium shot of Carol hiding under the bed. We notice she doesn't

          have her glasses anymore.

           PAUL (voice over)

           Oh, hi. Yeah. I know. I-I...Yes, I miss you, too. I did. I

           made all the arrangements.

          Back to Paul standing by the bed and talking in the telephone.

                          PAUL

           Yeah, look. I... Okay, I have to run. But I'll see you

           later, okay ? Okay.

          He puts the phone down on its hook, and starts walking out of the

          room. He stops, thinks for a couple of seconds, turns around, sits

          on the bed and picks up the phone.

          Back to Carol under the bed. The bed frame hits her back when Paul

          sits on it. She looks up. We hear Paul dialing a number.

           PAUL (voice over)

           Extension five. Well, keep ringing, would you please ?

           Because I just talked to her. What ? Okay. Uh, will you

           tell her... yes, tell her that Tom called. Tom. Thank you.

          Back to Paul sitting on the bed. He puts the phone down on its

          hook, stands up and starts walking out of the room.

          Back to Carol under the bed, waiting for Paul to get out of his

          apartment.

          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Starting from street level, the camera tilts up along a very

          modern office building, all glass and steel. A sign, above the

          main entrance, says 10 East 53. This is the building where

          Larry's office is located.

          LARRY'OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY

          Full shot of a large office room. In the forefront, a reception

          desk, with a young female receptionist talking to someone we still

          don't see. Coming from the other end of the room, Larry is walking

          with Marcia, a tall dark-haired lady, wearing sunglasses.

                          LARRY

           So, I thought your rewrites were great. I really think you

           helped your book, you know ? It's... It's dense a little

           bit, but, uh...

                          MARCIA

           Well, I don't want it to be too transparent, I mean...

          They are now at the reception desk level, and, since the camera is

          following them, we can see the young gentleman the receptionist is

          talking with.

                          LARRY

           That's... That's something you're never gonna have to worry

           about, you know ? This book makes Finnegan's Wake look

           like airplane reading, you know ? But-But it's long. It's-

           It's-It's...

          They are now walking along a corridor.

                          MARCIA

           You know, you're the only editor in the world I'll take

           suggestions from, but even you shouldn't push it.

                          LARRY

           No, I'm not pushing it. I think the book is great.

           Absolutely great. You know, but, uh... how much, how much

           of Dorothy is you? As I was reading it, I kept thinking how

           much is... you know, how much did you base it on your own

           life ?

          They have now reached a smaller room, actually Larry's private

          room. Marcia takes her glasses off, and then her coat, and sits on

          a sofa.

                          MARCIA

           Well, I was a waitress. I lived with a poet. I was a film

           critic.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Right, but not-not a blackjack dealer, right ?

                          MARCIA

           No, but I put myself through school playing poker.

          The camera pans to Larry, who is standing up at the other end of

          the room, looking through some documents.

                          LARRY

           Oh, really ? Do you still play ?

           MARCIA (voice over)

           No, but I still know how.

                          LARRY

           Yes ? Are you good ?

           MARCIA (voice over)

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, because maybe you could give me some pointers.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           I could turn your game around in two hours.

                          LARRY

           Could you ? That's great. That's... you know, you-you have

           all these skills, and you're beautiful, and you can write

           so well... and now it turns out you play poker. This is,

           uh, too good to be true.

          Larry sits down with the pile of documents on his laps. The camera

          pans back to Marcia. She has a cigarette in her hand.

                          MARCIA

           Well, I wouldn't say beautiful.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Oh, I would.

                          MARCIA

           But I do have tremendous sex-appeal.

          The camera pans back to Larry, who is looking through the huge

          pile of paper on his laps, perhaps a manuscript.

                          LARRY

           Okay, you sold me. Are-are you seeing anybody ?

           MARCIA (voice over)

           No. Don't let my confidence fool you, it's a facade. Why do

           you ask ?

                          LARRY

           Because I have a friend who became single recently, and I-I

           know he would get a big kick out of you.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           Oh. So, when do you want your poker lessons ?

                          LARRY

           Uh, next week. I could take you to lunch. We could-we

           could, um, I'll put you on my expense account, and you

           could... teach me when to... bet and when to fold.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           How about a cheeseburger right now ?

          The phone rings.

                          LARRY

           Now ? That's a possibility.

          Larry picks up the phone from a small table.

                          LARRY

           You know, we could, we could do...

           (talking into the telephone)

           Hallo. Yes ? Where are you ?

          The camera pans back to Marcia, who listens to Larry, smoking her

          cigarette.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Is everything okay ? Really ? No, I could, sure.

          The camera pans back to Larry.

                          LARRY

           I could. Yeah. I need-I need, you know, five minutes, or

           so. Okay. Yes. Yes. I know where it is. Okay, hold on.

          He puts the telephone down on its hook.

                          LARRY

           I can't do it. I have to... My wife, I have a little thing

           I have to do. I'll do the cheeseburger with you next week,

           or something.

          The camera pans back to Marcia, who is smiling.

                          MARCIA

           Story of my life !

          She crushes her cigarette in and ashtray and stands up.

          NEW-YORK - A PARK - EXTERIOR DAY

          Full shot of a round concrete pond, with a fountain in the middle

          pouring water. In the background, a meadow, with chairs scattered

          on it. Carol is standing by the pond. Larry is talking to her,

          looking very nervous.

                          LARRY

           What do you mean, you snuck into his apartment ? Are you

           nuts ?

                          CAROL

           Oh, stop being such a fuddy-dud.

                          LARRY

           A fuddy-dud ?

          Carol starts walking around the pond. Larry follows her.

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           What are you talking about ? That's a crime. You can't do

           that. You... That's-That's burglary and breaking and

           entering. But... What has gotten into you lately ? For

           crying out loud, save a little craziness for menopause.

                          CAROL

           It was a cinch. I took the key and I just let myself in.

                          LARRY

           Hey, look. Do... I don't want to... You-You'll wind up

           rooming with John Gotti. You can't do that. You can't just

           steal the key and then go into somebody's apartment.

                          CAROL

           Listen. He's not going snorkeling with his brother, okay ?

           Okay ?

                          LARRY

           I don't wanna know. I don't wanna be an accessory.

                          CAROL

           He's going to Paris, to a fancy hotel with a woman named

           Helen Moss.

                          LARRY

           Tell Ted. I don't want to know. Leave me alone.

          They keep on walking around the pond, the camera following them

          from a fixed location. They are now hidden by the fountain.

           CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain)

           I told Ted.

           LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain)

           You told Ted before you told me ?

           CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain)

           Yeah. He's more open-minded about these things.

           LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain)

           Yes, I know. I'm-I'm-I'm a bore. I'm-Because I-Because I

           don't break the law, you know ?

           CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain)

           Yeah.

           LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain)

           I live within the Constitution, so I'm dull.

           CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain)

           Listen. Perhaps he got rid of the urn, okay ?

          They appear back from behind the fountain.

                          LARRY

           I-I don't wanna hear. Leave me alone. Don't tell me.

                          CAROL

           He talked on the phone with a woman.

                          LARRY

           How do you know ?

                          CAROL

           Because he... Well, he came back while I was there, you

           know, so...

                          LARRY

           He did ?

                          CAROL

           Yeah, but I hid under the bed.

                          LARRY

           You hid under his bed ?

                          CAROL

           He didn't see me, Larry. He didn't see me at all.

                          LARRY

           I cannot believe this. My stomach is curdling, here I...

                          CAROL

           He was-He was very lovey-dovey with his kind of bimbo, you

           know ? He kept saying stuff like, you know, don't worry,

           it's gonna be all right. We're gonna be together. That

           kind of thing.

          They keep on walking around the pond, slowly coming back toward

          the camera, which moves a little to meet them.

                          LARRY

           But what would you have done if he, if he found you out ?

                          CAROL

           I know, listen, I-I couldn't think that far ahead.

                          LARRY

           That far ahead ? You're talking two seconds.

                          CAROL

           No, I c...

                          LARRY

           He could have looked under the bed and there you are. What

           do you...

                          CAROL

           Yeah, but... Larry, listen. And then, listen to this. He-He

           called this woman back. Probably this-this Helen Moss

           woman, right ?

                          LARRY

           I don't wanna know. Leave me alone.

                          CAROL

           And when he calls her back, she's not there. And then he

           leaves this message, and he says : Tell her Tom called.

           You know what I'm saying ? Tom. Tom, Larry.

          They are back at the same place where we saw them first by the

          pond. They stop walking.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, yeah. I... I know, I get it, his name is Paul, but I

           don't care. I don't wanna hear.

                          CAROL

           Well, okay. Well, I'll tell you. I thought I did...

                          LARRY

           I just don't...

                          CAROL

           I thought I did a great job, and so did Ted. I don't think

           a private eye could have done any better than me. I put

           everything back where I found it, I was very careful. I

           made one mistake.

                          LARRY

           What ?

                          CAROL

           I left my reading glasses on his table.

          Larry looks at her with a very puzzled eye.

          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium close shot on Paul's apartment front door. We get a close

          shot of the back of Carol's head. The door opens on Paul.

                          CAROL

           Oh, hallo. Hi. I-I thought I'd bring you some chocolate

           mousse. I know how much you enjoyed the last dessert.

          Carol walks rapidly inside the apartment, followed by Larry. Paul

          looks a bit surprised by this intrusion. He follows them along the

          corridor. He doesn't even close his front door !

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

          The camera follows the three persons along the corridor.

                          PAUL

           Well, thank you.

                          CAROL

           I thought I'd-I'd give you, you know, another shot at

           something really delicious. Do you want me to serve that

           for you, because, you know, you should have it while it's

           still fresh.

          The shot becoming a bit wider, we notice that Paul is carrying the

          tray of chocolate mousse that Carol gave him when entering his

          apartment.

                          LARRY

           And you can divide it up and we can all have some.

                          CAROL

           That'd be great. That's a great idea.

                          LARRY

           You'll really like this dessert.

                          PAUL

           Okay, I'll get some plates for it. Wait a minute.

          Paul walks out of the corridor toward his kitchen, and Carol

          rushes into the living-room.

                          CAROL

           Okay, that'd be really good.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, that's great.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          They both start searching the room frenetically. While Larry looks

          on the desk, Carol searches the rest of the room, even kneeling on

          the floor.

                          CAROL (WHISPERING)

           Come over here. I put'em... um... right here. Right in here

           somewhere. The first... Wait. I should...

           (to Paul, with a much louder voice)

           Uh, how-How are you doing in there ? You need...

          Larry drops things on the floor. With a nervous gesture, Carol

          shushes him.

                          CAROL

           You need any help ?

          The camera pans to the kitchen, where Paul is preparing the

          dessert.

                          PAUL

           No, I'm fine. I'll be right in.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Um... Okay, great.

          The camera pans back to the living room, where Larry is still

          nervously messing things on the desk. Then he starts moving around

          the room, looking for his wife's glasses. Carol puts things back

          in order on the desk. Larry walks to her, and whisper something we

          can't understand.

           LARRY (to Paul, with a louder voice)

           Are you okay ? Can-can-can-can we do anything for you ?

           PAUL (voice over from the kitchen)

           Coffee or tea ?

                          CAROL

           Tea. It's what... I'd like to have some tea.

          Paul walks into the room, with a pair of glasses in his hand.

                          PAUL

           You know, I found your glasses.

                          CAROL

           Mine ?

                          PAUL

           These are yours, aren't they ?

                          CAROL

           Yes.

                          LARRY

           No.

                          CAROL

           Uh, no. Yeah. Uh... No no no no no. They... They... Oh,

           God.

          Carol and Larry both look very nervous. Carol takes the glasses

          from Paul's hand.

                          LARRY

           No, no, those aren't yours. These are the same, actually.

           They are, aren't they ? These-These-These ones, are.

                          CAROL

           They are actually... They're mine. Honey, they're mine.

           I... You know what happened ? I think the other night, I

           must have left them here. It's the strangest thing.

                          PAUL

           Did you ? I didn't notice that.

                          CAROL

           No, no. Yeah. I know. Because, remember, you were saying

           that you thought that I left them at your mother's house ?

          Carol and Larry both look very embarrassed. Paul looks at them

          with a slight surprised eye.

                          LARRY

           At your mother's house.

                          CAROL

           That's right. Of course, so...

          She turns toward Paul, who has remained very calm.

                          PAUL

           That mousse looks fabulous.

                          CAROL

           Anyway, it's so good. I love mousse.

                          PAUL

           Thank you very much.

                          CAROL

           Hey, listen, are you looking forward to going snorkeling in

           the Caribbean ?

                          PAUL

           Very much. Very much.

                          CAROL

           Uh uh.

                          PAUL

           That's funny. I found those glasses under my bed.

                          CAROL

           That's because I must have dropped them and they probably

           got kicked under.

                          LARRY

           Kicked under, right, because what she'll do, she'll drop...

                          CAROL

           They were just...

                          LARRY

           She'll always drop things and she'll kick them all around

           the house.

                          CAROL

           They f...

                          PAUL

           The mousse ?

          He walks away to the kitchen, with a strange smile on his face.

                          LARRY

           She's always-She's always kick...

          Carol looks at Larry with a meaning look, to make him stop

          rambling.

                          CAROL

           Anyway, I'd love to have some mousse.

                          LARRY

           Yes, really ? Remember there was the time you kicked the

           mousse under the bed in the house. Remember that ? It

           was...

          Carol walks away toward the kitchen.

                          CAROL

           I remember.

                          LARRY

           It took-took six months to get the...

          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Medium full shot of Carol waiting under the awning of a place

          (hotel or club) called the Five Hundred. She hears a car

          stopping and she looks at the street.

           TED (voice over)

           Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. The traffic's murder.

          Carol runs to the car.

                          CAROL

           I know, but where... where are we going ?

           TED (voice over from inside the car)

           I looked up, looked up Helen Moss in the phone book.

          Carol climbs into the car and closes the door.

           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

           Yeah.

           TED (voice over from inside the car)

           It was just H. Moss.

           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

           Right.

           TED (voice over from inside the car)

           So I-it's on Bank Street...

          The car drives away, with Ted's voice fading as the car gets away

          from us.

           TED (voice over from inside the car)

           Bank Street... we're going to go down and do surveillance.

           I got a lot whole of food. It's great. I called up this...

           I called this number.

          NEW-YORK - BANK STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Full view of the corner of two very quiet streets. A brick

          building covered with vines. The camera pans away from the

          building to Ted's car parked on the other side of the street

          corner. Medium shot of the inside of the car, through the open

          window on the passenger's side, Carol's side.

                          TED

           There's her house.

                          CAROL

           Right. So we should just sit here and wait, huh ?

                          TED

           Yeah.

                          CAROL

           Okay.

          They look at each other and laugh.

          Slightly later. Medium shot through the windshield. The view is a

          little blurred by the daylight reflection on the windshield.

                          TED

           Maybe he thought that if he, if he, if he divorced her,

           she'd-she'd hit him for a ton of alimony. Or maybe she,

           maybe she controls the family fortune. What do you think of

           that ?

                          CAROL

           Oh, I don't know. Yeah, maybe we're wrong, Ted. Maybe we're

           just, you know... I mean, maybe she died of natural causes,

           like the doctor said and we're just two people with, you

           know, hyperactive imaginations whose lives need a little

           shot of adrenaline.

          Ted looks through the paper food-bag he has brought with him.

                          TED

           Does yours ? I'll tell you, mine needs something.

                          CAROL

           Yeah? What's that, there ?

                          TED

           You want ? They're jelly doughnuts. You want a jelly

           doughnut ?

           CAROL (with a disgusted tone in her voice)

           Ooh.

                          TED

           Eh ? Come on. No, come on. Come on. You gotta get into it.

                          CAROL

           Okay.

                          TED

           Oh my God. Look, look, look, look, look !

          The camera pans to the other corner of the street. Two people, a

          male and a female, are coming out of the brick building.

           CAROL (voice over)

           What ? What ? What ? What ?

           TED (yelling in voice over)

           Helen ! Helen !

           (Back to a normal low voice)

           Duck, duck, duck !

          Neither one of the couple has turned around at the sound of Ted's

          yelling, and they start walking down the street, away from the

          corner.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Ted! God, oh...Oh.

           TED (yelling in voice over)

           Helen !

          The camera pans back to the car, looking through the open window

          on the passenger's side. Carol is hiding under the dashboard. Ted

          is hiding his face with his paper bag, holding a paper cup in the

          other hand.

                          TED

           It's not her.

                          CAROL

           It's not her ?

          She sits back in her seat.

                          TED

           No, it's not her.

          Carol laughs.

                          TED

           What...

                          CAROL

           Oh, God, you really have this worked out, don't you ?

          She keeps on laughing. Ted starts laughing too.

          Slightly later. It is raining. It is still the same medium shot

          through the passenger's window, but the window is now closed, with

          the rain pouring on the window-pane.

                          TED

           I figured she'd come out and go to work, you know ?

                          CAROL

           Maybe she doesn't work. Maybe she's like... you and she has

           writers hours.

                          TED

           I'm writing a play about something that happened to you and

           me.

                          CAROL

           Oh, God. Oh, dear. What ?

                          TED

           Remember-Remember that time... you and... you and I and

           Larry and Julie were all on that-that eating tour of

           France ?

                          CAROL

           Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah.

                          TED

           And they, and then they wandered off and they forgot to

           pick us up ? You remember ? We had to share that bed-and-

           breakfast place.

                          CAROL

           Right. Do you remember those wonderful cottages ?

                          TED

           Yeah.

                          CAROL

           And I remember... that we shared a bedroom together,

           right ?

                          TED

           Yeah, but not a bed.

          The camera pans away from the car to the other corner of the

          street. Someone is coming out of the brick building. It is

          apparently a male wearing white pants. He opens an umbrella.

           CAROL (voice over)

           No, not a... Well, God. You were too gentlemanly to suggest

           that.

                          TED

           Well, it's not... Not that I didn't think of it.

          The camera follows the man with white pants, while he is crossing

          the street on the other side of the street from the car.

                          CAROL

           No. Well, I knew what was going on in your mind... because

           of the way you kept plying me with Chateau Margaux,

           remember ?

          The camera is back behind the passenger's window of the car.

          Though the car-windows, we see the white-pants-man walking on the

          sidewalk on the other side of the street. Ted and Carol do not

          seem to notice him at all.

                          TED

           It could have been our little secret, then you passed out.

                          CAROL

           Well, you... Yeah, God. It seems like a long time ago,

           doesn't it ?

                          TED

           Not that long ago.

          Slightly later. The rain has stopped. Same shot through the

          passenger's window of the car, but the window is now open again.

          A long pause. Ted and Carol seem to be both lost them in their own

          thoughts. Then Ted gives a look outside and comes back to

          attention.

                          TED

           Look, look, look, look.

                          CAROL

           Oh, what ?

          The camera pans to the other side of the street. A woman is coming

          out of the brick building.

           TED (yelling in voice over)

           Helen !

           (with a softer voice)

           Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck !

          On the other side of the street, the woman has stopped and is

          looking around her.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Oh, god, yeah. Right.

           TED (voice over)

           She didn't see us. She didn't see us.

           CAROL (voice over)

           No ? No. That's gotta be her.

           TED (voice over)

           I'll bet it's...

          The woman starts walking again on the sidewalk.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Are you sure ?

           TED (voice over)

           I mean, she answered to Helen.

           CAROL (voice over)

           She answers to... She's pretty.

           TED (voice over)

           Yeah, I'll say.

          The woman has reached the corner of the street and she lifts her

          arm.

           CAROL (voice over)

           She's... What is she doing ? She's getting a...

           TED (voice over)

           She's getting a cab.

          A yellow cab stops near the woman.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Okay, okay. Hold on.

           TED (voice over)

           Keep-Keep down.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Okay, don't worry. Don't worry.

           TED (voice over)

           I'm gonna follow her.

           CAROL (voice over)

           All right.

          The woman opens the cab door and climbs into it.

          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Long shot of a street covered with a metal structure. We could be

          under a commuter train bridge. The yellow cab is driving toward

          us. The cab stops at the corner of the street with another street.

          The woman comes out of the cab, and walks away on the sidewalk of

          the other street. The camera pans back to the first street and we

          see Ted's car coming toward us. The camera stops at the corner of

          the street and Carol walks out of the car. She runs in the

          direction of Helen, and waves Ted to join her. The camera pans to

          the end of the street, which actually is a dead end street with

          the back door of a movie house. The woman enters the movie house.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of a door leading to an emergency stair way. Helen,

          the woman we just saw coming out of the yellow cab, is coming down

          the steps and through the door. She is blonde, young and pretty.

           PAUL (voice over)

           Watch your step. It's very steep. Be careful.

          Behind Helen, Paul is coming out of the stairway. Helen has

          stopped to look around her.

                          HELEN

           Oh, this is beautiful.

                          PAUL

           Isn't it ?

                          HELEN

           Yeah.

          The camera pans away from the couple toward the main hall of the

          movie house. It is an old-fashioned movie house, with red velvet

          seats, and a carved balcony.

           PAUL (voice over)

           Well, we only show revivals now. This week, we have Fred

           Astaire. Next week, we have an Orson Welles festival.

           HELEN (voice over)

           Oh, yeah ?

           PAUL (voice over)

           Yeah, it'll be about the last thing we do before we start

           renovating.

          The camera keeps on panning around the room.

           HELEN (voice over)

           Mm. Oh, Paul, I...

           PAUL (voice over)

           Oh, come on, there's nobody around.

          We hear moaning and kissing sounds.

           HELEN (voice over)

           I-I...

           PAUL (voice over)

           Come on.

           HELEN (voice over)

           Okay.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY

          Full shot of the backstage behind the screen. In a corner, a

          stairway going to the top of the backstage. Half-hidden on the

          stairway, Carol and Ted.

           HELEN (voice over)

           I've never been behind a movie screen before like this.

           PAUL (voice over)

           Strange, isn't it ?

           HELEN (voice over)

           Yeah.

           PAUL (voice over)

           Used to be a first-run house when the neighborhood was

           better.

          The camera pans to the back of the screen, in front of which Paul

          and Helen are standing.

                          HELEN

           Oh.

                          PAUL

           Beautiful, huh ? Look around.

                          HELEN

           All these mirrors.

          The camera pans around the room, where a lot of huge mirrors are

          stacked.

                          PAUL

           Huh ? Well, it used to be all mirrors, and it was quite

           beautiful.

          The camera tilts down to give us a closer shot on the mirrors.

           PAUL (voice over)

           I'm having all this broken glass replaced as we go along

           with this renovation. You know, they used to have stage

           shows, here. Now, of course, we only show old movies.

          The camera tilts back up on Paul and Helen.

                          HELEN

           It has such a lonely feeling.

                          PAUL

           That's because I'm the only one here. And my assistant,

           Mrs. Dalton. I'm gonna have this place fixed up, then I'm

           gonna sell it. The money's gonna come in handy.

                          HELEN

           It sure will.

          Paul looks around, a bit worried.

                          PAUL

           What's that noise ?

                          HELEN

           Where ?

          The camera pans to the other side of the room, where a middle-aged

          woman with red curly hair has just entered. She is Gladys Dalton,

          Paul's assistant. She is walking with the help of a cane.

           PAUL (voice over)

           Oh, Mrs. Dalton. I didn't know you were here so early.

                          GLADYS

           Oh, uh, I-I didn't know whether an-anyone was here. I-I'm

           sorry. I-I-I heard the noise and I thought...

           PAUL (voice over)

           It's quite all right.

                          GLADYS

           But, but, uh...

           PAUL (voice over)

           It's quite all right.

                          GLADYS

           I apologize.

           PAUL (voice over)

           Quite all right.

                          GLADYS

           All right.

          Gladys Dalton starts going out of the room and the camera tilts up

          on the stairway, on which Ted and Carol are still hiding.

           HELEN (voice over)

           I'd love to really get an acting job. I had it with this

           modeling.

           PAUL (voice over)

           Maybe you won't have to work at all.

          Ted and Carol are moving away from the stairway, which remains

          empty.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Close shot on the clock on the wall : the time is just after one

          o'clock. The room is completely dark and the clock is the only

          source of light. The camera pans to the bed and on Carol, sound

          asleep. We hear a noise, like an object dropping down. Carol

          instantly wakes up. She gets up and the camera pans to Larry,

          still asleep. He eventually wakes up, moves around in the bed,

          takes his glasses from the night-table and put them on his nose.

           CAROL (whispering in voice over)

           Oh, my God.

          Slowly Larry gets out of the bed.

                          LARRY

           What's the matter ?

           CAROL (voice over)

           Larry, come with me, okay ?

          Larry starts walking along the corridor.

                          LARRY

           Oh, Geez, I was...

           CAROL (voice over)

           Come on.

                          LARRY

           I was fast asleep. I was dreaming of round card girls.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Larry has reached the front hall. Carol is looking through the

          peephole of the front door.

                          CAROL

           Okay. Uh, it looks like he's gone. Yeah. Yeah. He's gone.

                          LARRY

           Oh, Christ. Not that again. Please, you know...

                          CAROL

           Listen, Larry. I want to take another look around his

           apartment. Yeah.

          Carol walks along the corridor toward the bedroom. Larry follows

          her.

                          LARRY

           What are you talking about ? Where're you going ?

                          CAROL

           Listen.

                          LARRY

           It's-It's one o'clock in the morn...

                          CAROL

           He'll never be back, Larry.

                          LARRY

           What ? What ?

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                          CAROL

           No, he's not coming back. Not for at least an hour, an hour

           and a half.

                          LARRY

           What-What're you doing ? You got his key ?

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           You're kidding. What are you talking about ? You can't

           do... Why... because you-you followed him to the movie

           house, you-you said there was nothing happening.

                          CAROL

           No, wait a minute, look, he was with this young model type,

           and they were talking about money.

          Carol is putting her shoes on.

                          LARRY

           Well, so what ? That's the...

                          CAROL

           So, that's the motive.

                          LARRY

           What... Hey, listen to me. Come here.

                          CAROL

           What are you talking about ?

          Carol walks back through the corridor toward the front hall. Larry

          follows her.

                          LARRY

           Come here. Wait a minute. Come here. Look, look.

                          CAROL

           Come here. What do you mean, Larry ?

                          LARRY

           I've been thinking about you.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

                          CAROL

           What do you mean ?

                          LARRY

           I think you gotta see... I gotta... You gotta, you gotta go

           back to your shrink.

                          CAROL

           What do you m...

                          LARRY

           I want you to see Doctor Ballard again.

                          CAROL

           Huh ? Larry, I went for two years.

                          LARRY

           I'm s... Yeah. I know. But you...

                          CAROL

           Just come... come on.

                          LARRY

           You know how General Motors will recall defective cars ?

           Well, you gotta go in for a tune-up.

                          CAROL

           Larry, we'll be in and out in five minutes.

                          LARRY

           You got... No. No.

                          CAROL

           Five. Only five.

                          LARRY

           I... What... I'm telling you, I'm your husband. I command

           you to sleep !

          He points to the bedroom.

                          CAROL

           Well, I didn't...

                          LARRY

           Sleep ! I command it !

                          CAROL

           No, I...

                          LARRY

           I command it ! Sleep !

                          CAROL

           Larry, all I can tell you is, if this had been a few years

           ago, you would have been doing the same thing. Because if

           you recall, we solved a mystery. Yep, we solved a mystery

           once. Remember ? It was the-it was the noises in the attic

           mystery.

                          LARRY

           Uh, yes. The country house. The bluebird. I know.

                          CAROL

           That's right. So...

                          LARRY

           But that, though, was a sweet mystery. This is murder.

                          CAROL

           This... Wh... You agree, right ? It's murder, Larry ? So,

           I'm right.

          She opens the front door and walks out of the apartment.

                          LARRY

           No, I... Yeah, look, no, I-I forbid you ! I forbid you to

           go! It's a-a... I'm forbidding ! Is that what you do when I

           forbid you ? If-If that's what you... I'm not going to be

           forbidding you a lot, if you do...

          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Full shot of the landing. Carol is walking rapidly toward us and

          Paul's apartment. Larry walks behind her. Carol takes Paul's key

          out of her pocket and tries to open the front door. But she takes

          the wrong key on the keyring.

                          CAROL

           Oh, damn it.

          Larry takes her by the shoulders.

                          LARRY

           Don't do this. We should be asleep, now, in one of our many

           cuddling positions.

                          CAROL

           Please, stop it, will you ? Please, be quiet, Larry.

                          LARRY

           This is wrong.

                          CAROL

           Be quiet. You're gonna wake up the neighbors, okay ? Okay,

           I got it. I got it.

          She opens the door.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Full shot of the front door, seen from the living room. A small

          lamp is still lit on a low table. The door opens and Carol walks

          in, followed by Larry.

                          LARRY

           This is no good. I promise you, this could only lead to

           great unhappiness.

                          CAROL

           Listen, Larry... Relax, okay ?

          She closes the front door.

                          LARRY

           Pl... I can't relax. How can I relax ? I'm in a strange

           man's apartment in my, in my T-shirt and-and pajamas.

                          CAROL

           Oh, don't worry about it. All right, now Ted told me to try

           something here... Yeah.

          She rests her hands on the telephone, which is next to the lamp.

                          LARRY

           What do you mean, Ted told you ? Who... Ted ? Ted ? What is

           he, your mentor ?

          The camera zooms to a close shot on the telephone. Carol picks it

          up.

                          CAROL

           Um, Last number dialed.

          The camera zooms backward to Carol with the phone handset to her

          ear.

                          LARRY

           Ted is a sick schmuck. He's-He's home, and we're in...

                          CAROL

           Just be quiet for a second, all right ?

          She listens to the phone.

                          CAROL

           Shhh !

                          LARRY

           I mean, I'm... What if he comes back ? I'm... My heart

           is....

                          CAROL

           Larry.

           MALE VOICE OVER FROM THE PHONE

           Waldron.

                          CAROL

           Uh, who ?

           MALE VOICE OVER FROM THE PHONE

           Who is this ? Who do you want ?

                          CAROL

           Um, who's this ?

          She puts her hand on the phone microphone and turns toward Larry.

                          CAROL

           Do you know anybody named Waldron ? Waldron ?

                          LARRY

           Hang the phone up.

                          CAROL

           Just be quiet. Okay, wait.

                          LARRY

           Hang the phone up, now.

          She puts the phone handset back to her ear.

                          CAROL

           Oh, great. Now they-they hung up on us.

                          LARRY

           Good, good.

          He takes the handset from her hand and slams it down.

                          CAROL

           Oh, great.

                          LARRY

           Let's get out. I wanna go home. I want to go back to bed.

                          CAROL

           No, just let me think for a second, now. Waldron, right ?

           Helen Moss. Okay. He used the name Tom, right ? So, Tom

           Waldron. We gotta run a check on that.

                          LARRY

           Run a check on it ? What, do you want to beat it down to

           the morgue ? You got all the jargon.

                          CAROL

           Come on.

          She walks away from the phone table.

                          LARRY

           Where are you going ?

                          CAROL

           Right.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Carol enters the bedroom, followed by Larry.

                          LARRY

           I'm not a night person. I don't wanna be... What are you...

           I don't know what I'm looking for.

                          CAROL

           Oh, oh, wait. Look.

          She starts looking through the mail scattered on a table.

                          LARRY

           What ? What do you wanna do, go through the guy's mail ?

           This is insane.

          He starts looking through the mail.

                          CAROL

           What do you mean ?

                          LARRY

           Oh, my...

          As he takes some more letters, Larry hits a small porcelain

          statuette, and drops it on the floor, where it breaks. He bends

          down to pick up the debris.

                          LARRY

           Jesus. Oh, Christ !

                          CAROL

           What are you do... Well, just... Clean it up, Larry. Clean

           it up.

          Larry stands up.

                          LARRY

           What do you mean, clean it up ? What am I gonna do,

           vacuum ?

                          CAROL

           Put it under the rug, or something like that, okay ?

                          LARRY

           I can't. It's a wall-to-wall carpet. I broke his-his-his-

           his... porcelain...

          He looks at the porcelain pieces in his hands.

                          CAROL

           Well then glue it. Glue it back to...

          She moves around the room.

                          LARRY

           What do you mean, glue it ? What are you talking about ?

                          CAROL

           Oh, look. Look.

                          LARRY

           What ?

                          CAROL

           Look.

          She shows him a pair of gloves she just picked up on a low table.

                          LARRY

           So what ? Gloves. I have gloves. They keep my fingers warm.

                          CAROL

           So ? I know. I know, but you keep yours out on the bureau

           in this kind of weather ? Uh ?

                          LARRY

           Let's get out of here, because this is a...

                          CAROL

           I think something's very strange, here. I mean, he left

           these out and ready. I think the whole thing is really

           sinister.

                          LARRY

           It's eye of the beholder. What you have... you've got to go

           to the eye doctor, get happy glasses.

          He pushes her toward the exit of the room.

                          CAROL

           What ?

                          LARRY

           Look, I'm gonna take the pieces with us, and we'll-we'll

           get rid of them.

          NEW-YORK - CLUB TWENTY-ONE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of the famous entrance of the club 21, with the line

          of painted cast iron lawn jockey statues which adorns the balcony

          above the entrance. The camera zooms backward to give a full shot

          of the entrance of the club.

          NEW-YORK - CLUB TWENTY-ONE - INTERIOR DAY

          Full shot on the lobby of the club. On the right, a counter with

          an attendant behind the counter. Facing us the entrance of the

          main room. Carol, Larry, and their son Nick, are coming out of the

          room. Nick must be in his early twenties.

                          CAROL

           So, how did you like your birthday cake, Nick ?

                          NICK

           I loved it, I...

                          CAROL

           I know.

                          NICK

           I loved... But then again, I love chocolate anything, so...

          The camera moves around the three people as they walk toward the

          cloakroom.

                          CAROL

           I know.

                          LARRY

           Right.

                          CAROL

           I know. What-What-What are you laughing about ?

                          NICK

           Well, I...

                          LARRY

           If only he could stay in town-If only could stay in town

           just a couple of more hours.

                          NICK

           I know. I was going to, but I...

                          CAROL

           Well, what about that ?

                          NICK

           They're working us so hard at school. I can't.

                          CAROL

           Oh.

          They've stopped in front of the cloakroom.

                          NICK

           I gotta get right back.

                          CAROL

           Really.

                          LARRY

           I'm gonna take him to Brooks Brothers for his present. And-

           And-And, uh...

                          NICK

           Brooks Brothers. Yeah.

                          LARRY

           Your mother's going to a wine-tasting.

                          CAROL

           You're going to get something from Brooks Brothers ?

                          NICK

           Yeah. A sweater.

                          LARRY

           She's going to a wine-tasting. Can you believe that ?

                          CAROL

           Well, if I'm going to be a restaurant owner, I should know

           something about wines. Don't you... Larry ?

          Larry walks across the lobby, because he has seen someone he knows

          in the sitting-room. He waves his hand and comes back to his wife

          and his son.

                          LARRY

           Hi. Hey, I want you to meet somebody.

                          CAROL

           What ?

          The camera pans around, to show us Marcia crossing the sitting-

          room.

                          LARRY

           I want you to meet somebody. This is, this is...

                          MARCIA

           Hi, Larry.

                          LARRY

           Hi. How are you ?

                          MARCIA

           Good. How are you doing ?

                          LARRY

           This is my wife.

          Marcia has reached the lobby.

                          CAROL

           Honey, I'm here. I'm right o...

                          LARRY

           You snuck around.

                          CAROL

           Carol. Remember me ?

                          LARRY

           Yeah. This is Marcia Fox.

          The two women shake hands.

                          CAROL

           Oh, hi.

                          MARCIA

           Hi.

                          LARRY

           My son Nick. He's in town on, uh...

                          MARCIA

           Good to see you.

                          LARRY

           It's his birthday, so we took him to Twenty-One.

          Marcia shakes hands with Nick.

                          NICK

           Nick. How are you doing ?

                          LARRY

           It's a tradition we have in the family.

                          MARCIA

           That's great. Oh, your friend called me. He's taking me to

           dinner in New Jersey next week. Some mafia joint.

                          LARRY

           Oh, I fixed her up with Ted. He's going to take her...

                          CAROL

           Oh, you did.

                          LARRY

           Yeah. That place that we ate at.

                          CAROL

           Well, very nice. That's lovely.

                          LARRY

           He's a lot of fun. You'll have a very good time.

                          MARCIA

           Great. Great.

                          LARRY

           That's great. So.

                          MARCIA

           Well, good to see you. Good to see you.

                          CAROL

           Okay, you too.

                          MARCIA

           Take care.

                          CAROL

           Goodbye.

          Marcia walks away.

                          LARRY

           Oh, it's great. She'll have a great time.

                          CAROL

           So, that's Marcia Fox, huh ?

                          LARRY

           S-So, what are you making a face for ? She's great.

                          CAROL

           Well, do you think she's Ted's type ? Is that...

                          LARRY

           Ted's type ?

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

          Larry gives his ticket to the cloakroom attendant, whom we don't

          see.

                          LARRY

           She's anybody's type. She's brilliant, she's talented.

           Yeah. I gave you...

                          CAROL

           Thank you.

          Larry gives her purse to Carol.

                          LARRY

           You get your bag.

                          CAROL

           You know, your pupils are dilating.

                          LARRY

           No, she's dangerously sexual.

          They start walking toward the entrance of the club.

                          CAROL

           I just wanted to tell you that.

                          LARRY

           Let me tell you... Listen, when you go to the wine-tasting,

           honey...

                          CAROL

           I see.

                          LARRY

           Getting back to real life, spit it out. Okay ? When you

           drink...

                          NICK

           Yeah. Don't drink too much, Mom.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, spit... And spit it out.

                          CAROL

           What do you mean ? Nick.

                          LARRY

           They spit it out at a wine-tasting, you know what I mean ?

           Because, yeah. I don't want you to be lying on the bathroom

           floor with your head by the bowl tonight, you know ?

          They walk out of the club.

          NEW-YORK - A LOUNGE - INTERIOR DAY

          This is very nice lounge in New-York, very tastefully decorated.

          It looks like one of those old English Club in London. Beautiful

          paintings on the walls, and even stained glasses on the windows.

          This is where the wine-tasting is taking place. The camera pans

          around the room. We see people talking while holding wine-glasses.

          We hear Ted and Carol's conversation without seeing them yet.

           TED (voice over)

           That Mouton 45. That was...

           CAROL (voice over)

           Didn't you love it ?

           TED (voice over)

           Oh, that was-was like, sublime, you know ?

           CAROL (voice over)

           Yeah.

           TED (voice over)

           And the inexpensive Spanish one. Wasn't that... wasn't that

           a nice surprise ?

           CAROL (voice over)

           It was very, very...

           TED (voice over)

           Wasn't that great ?

           CAROL (voice over)

           Yeah.

           TED (voice over)

           Look at these paintings. Look at this.

           CAROL (voice over)

           So, uh...

          The camera has reached Ted and Carol and follows them walking in

          the room.

                          TED

           I love the blue in that.

                          CAROL

           So, Larry fixed you up with Marcia Fox, huh ? His, uh...

                          TED

           Yeah, yeah, well, you know. He's...

                          CAROL

           His favorite writer.

                          TED

           He says she's wonderful, and I'm...

                          CAROL

           Oh.

                          TED

           I'm trying to do everything I can to get out and meet

           people, you know.

                          CAROL

           Sure.

          We now get a medium shot of Carol and Ted walking toward us.

                          TED

           I'm-I'm not looking forward to this.

                          CAROL

           So, you're taking her to Vincent's out in Jersey ?

                          TED

           Yeah.

                          CAROL

           Is that what you're...

                          TED

           I-I guess. She's not my first choice.

                          CAROL

           No ? God, look at this! Oh, that park is so beautiful.

          They have reach a large window, where they can get a view of the

          park on the other side of the street.

                          TED

           Yeah, it's great. Of course, I can't have my first choice.

                          CAROL

           No ?

                          TED

           I'm getting drunk. I don't know what I'm saying.

          He sits down. She sits down on the sofa besides him. Behind them,

          you see the park through the windows.

                          CAROL

           You're getting... So am I. I don't know about this.

          Ted looks at his watch.

                          TED

           I'm gonna be late for my shrink. I've got a...

                          CAROL

           You've got to go, huh ?

                          TED

           Yeah.

                          CAROL

           Okay.

                          TED

           Well, you know, you would be my first choice.

                          CAROL

           Me, huh ?

                          TED

           Yeah.

          Carol laughs.

                          CAROL

           Well. Oh, boy.

                          TED

           Well, you... Can I give you a lift ? Do you, uh, I'm gonna

           go east. Do you...

                          CAROL

           Thanks. No, I-I think I'll stick around, I need to think. I

           need my... I feel a little, you know, tipsy.

                          TED

           I didn't offend you by what I said, did I ?

                          CAROL

           No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You didn't offend

           me, no, I was very, uh, flattered by this, Ted. Flattered.

           Well, anyway.

                          TED

           See you later.

          He stands up and bumps into a low table in front of the sofa.

                          CAROL

           See you. Oops, careful. Whoops.

                          TED

           Sorry. Excuse me.

                          CAROL

           Excuse me.

          Carol looks at him walking away with a strange expression in her

          eyes.

          NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Medium tracking shot of Ted walking on the sidewalk, coming from

          the lounge and toward us.

          Medium low-angle shot of one of the window of the lounge, seen

          from the street. This shot is low-angled because the lounge is

          located slightly above street level. Carol is seated in front of

          the window, looking very pensive. She takes a sip of her glass of

          The street seen through the window, next to which Carol is seated,

          but we don't actually see Carol. We see a big car, followed by a

          bus. The camera zooms on the bus. Through one of the bus windows,

          we see a woman, seated inside the bus. And this woman looks very

          much like the deceased Lilian, Paul's wife.

          Close shot on the window, in front of which Carol is seated. She

          looks at the passing bus, with a wide open mouth, and a surprised,

          almost frightened, expression on her face. She stands up a little

          and then sits back.

          NEW-YORK - A LOUNGE - INTERIOR DAY

          Full view of the room. In the background, Carol, still seated by

          the window. She stands up, picks up her purse, and starts crossing

          the room, bumping into people. She reaches the staircase, and

          walks downstairs.

          NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Full view on the entrance of the lounge. Carol is walking rapidly

          down the stairs leading to the entrance. She reaches the sidewalk,

          and looks around her for the bus. She walks away from the lounge

          and toward us, with the camera on a tracking shot in front of her.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of Larry working in the kitchen, putting things away

          in the cupboards. Behind him, we see the front hall. The front

          door opens and Carol walks in.

                          LARRY

           I got a great sweater at Brooks Brothers' today for Nick,

           today.

          Carols closes the door and leans on the wall. But Larry doesn't

          seem to understand that something is wrong with her. He walks away

          to the sitting room. He keeps on talking in voice over, while

          Carol is still leaning on the wall of the front hall.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Really beautiful. It's cashmere. Very expensive. The kid

           looked so handsome in it, though. Also, I decided I'd cook

           dinner tonight. My one dish tuna casserole.

          Larry comes back in the kitchen and looks at his wife, but still

          doesn't seem to notice that something is wrong. We follow Larry

          into the sitting-room.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Larry is setting the table for dinner

           CAROL (voice over)

           Well, no wonder he had her cremated.

                          LARRY

           What ?

           CAROL (voice over)

           Mrs. House.

                          LARRY

           Oh, Jesus. You're not about Mrs. House again. I thought

           we'd have a light dinner, you know, because we had a rich

           lunch at Twenty-One, I thought.

          The camera pans to Carol standing at the entrance of the room and

          leaning on the wall

                          CAROL

           Larry.

           LARRY (voice over)

           What ?

                          CAROL

           I just saw Mrs. House.

           LARRY (voice over)

           What are you talking about ? The ashes ?

                          CAROL

           No, no, no. A bus. It passed me, and she was on it.

          Larry joins Carol.

                          LARRY

           Uh, the dead woman passed you on a bus ? Which bus was

           this, the bus to heaven ?

          Larry walks away toward the kitchen. Carol follows him.

                          CAROL

           No, but I'm not, I'm not joking. I mean, I'm telling you

           something. I'm telling you, I really saw her. I actually

           saw her.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

          Larry is checking his cooking.

                          LARRY

           Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

          Larry takes two wine-glasses out of the sink.

                          LARRY

           You want to lie down for a while ? We'll put a cold

           compress on your head, or a hot compress on your back,

           or...

                          CAROL

           No, Larry, you know, I was at the wine-tasting, right ? And

           I was just... I was sitting at, you know, a bay window. I-I

           happened to look out. A bus passed, and she was on it,

           Larry.

                          LARRY

           Remember I said to you ? Yes, remember I said to you, spit

           it out ?

                          CAROL

           I...

                          LARRY

           I said don't drink it. You said you were going to a wine-

           tasting ?

                          CAROL

           But ?

                          LARRY

           You said you were going to taste wine all afternoon ? I

           said spit it out ?

                          CAROL

           Yeah...

                          LARRY

           I said don't swallow it ? You swallowed it. And that's why

           you're this way.

                          CAROL

           I know. I know. Okay. I-I... Yeah. I had a few drinks, but

           it's-it's not... I mean, I saw her.

          Larry puts the glasses away on the dinner table.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, I 'm sure you saw her.

                          CAROL

           I ...

                          LARRY

           How could you see her ? She's dead. Not only is she dead,

           she's been cremated. It's not even Halloween.

          They walk into the sitting-room.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          CAROL

           Okay. Are you telling me that you... That, that, that, that

           you... That I didn't see her ? Is that what you're saying ?

                          LARRY

           I think it's a pretty fair assumption that if a person is

           dead, they don't suddenly turn up in the New York City

           transit system.

                          CAROL

           I just... I just don't know what's happening, Larry. I-I-I

           don't know what's going on.

                          LARRY

           What's going on ?

                          CAROL

           What's... yeah.

                          LARRY

           Let me put it this way : total psychotic breakdown. Okay ?

           Is that enough ?

                          CAROL

           I...

                          LARRY

           Maybe, look. Maybe she's a twin. That's possible. Now

           forget this.

                          CAROL

           Why ?

                          LARRY

           Taste my tuna casserole. Tell me if I put in too much hot

           fudge.

          He opens the dish he had put earlier on the table.

                          CAROL

           Honey, you're getting so close-minded these days. I just...

          The phone rings.

                          CAROL

           Oh. Oh, God.

          She picks up the phone from the wall. Larry sits at the table.

                          CAROL

           Hallo ? Ted. Ted.

                          LARRY

           Oh, Ted. Ted.

                          CAROL

           Ted, you're not going to believe this, but, Ted, I saw Mrs.

           House. Yes, Mrs. House. Yeah. Mrs... the murdered woman.

           That's right.

          Larry opens the red wine bottle and pours some wine in his glass.

                          LARRY

           She wasn't murdered. It was a coronary. It was a coronary,

           folks. It was a coronary. She wasn't murdered. I don't know

           what they're talking about.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. No, I'm sure. I'm sure I saw her. She was on a bus,

           you know ? I mean, I-I saw her just moments after you left.

           I was looking out the...

          Larry puts the cork back on the bottle.

                          LARRY

           He was at the wine tasting, too. Sure, why not.

                          CAROL

           Would you ?

                          LARRY

           They're both at the wine tasting.

                          CAROL

           Would you really ? Oh, that would be so great. You'd just

           run a check on Paul and Lillian House.

          Larry stands up and walks toward Carol.

                          LARRY

           Don't run a check. Don't run a check.

          He takes the phone from Carol's hand.

                          CAROL

           What are you talking...

                          LARRY

           Stop.

                          CAROL

           What are you doing ? I mean...

          Larry talks to Ted on the phone.

                          LARRY

           Listen, could you call back later, because my marriage is

           falling apart.

          He puts the phone down.

                          CAROL

           Larry, what are you... But, what ?

                          LARRY

           Forget it. Will you ? If you're gonna have an affair with

           the guy, you don't need a murder to do it.

                          CAROL

           I'm telling you, I saw Mrs. House.

          Larry sits back at the table.

                          LARRY

           Yes, I know, on the bus, the dead persons' bus. No car

           fare.

                          CAROL

           I s...Okay.

                          LARRY

           Now, sit down. Let's...

                          CAROL

           Now look. Just... I can tell you. I can show you the exact

           spot, Larry.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, I'm not going to see the exact spot.

                          CAROL

           Uh ? What about lunch ? Tomorrow ?

                          LARRY

           No, I've got a business lunch tomorrow. I got...

                          CAROL

           On... on your, on your lunch hour ?

                          LARRY

           No, I got a business lunch. I'm not interested.

                          CAROL

           Oh, God. I'm telling you... I mean, this is such a shock.

                          LARRY

           Hm ? I'm not interested. Come on, will you...

          She walks away toward the front hall.

                          CAROL

           I mean, I'm telling you, I'm just vibrating from this. I

           mean, I saw this woman.

                          LARRY

           Will you eat something ? We've got tickets to the theatre.

          Carol comes back into the room.

                          CAROL

           What ? Wh...I'm not going to the theatre.

           LARRY (voice over)

           What do you mean you're not go... We've been holding onto

           these tickets for two months, now.

          Carol walks again to the front hall and comes back toward the

          sitting room, via the kitchen.

                          CAROL

           Do you comprehend the enormity of what I'm telling you,

           Larry ? Do you compr...

           LARRY (voice over)

           If you got a big story, tell it to the Police. Don't tell

           it to me.

                          CAROL

           What am I going to say to them ?

                          LARRY

           Tell them your story. Tell them this whole cockamamie

           story.

                          CAROL

           What story ? I don't have a story. I mean, I got nothing.

           Unless... Oh !

                          LARRY

           That's right. That's right, you've got nothing.

                          CAROL

           Unless... Unless I locate her.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, okay, good. Now, will you sit down because we're

           going to the theater. I don't care what you say.

          She takes a drink on water in the kitchen.

          LARRY'S BUILDING - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium shot of Larry and Carol coming out of the lift. They cross

          the lobby. Jack, the caretaker of the building in standing near

          the entrance of the building.

                          LARRY

           Oh, Jack ? Jack ? You-you were there when Mrs. House died,

           right? You saw her ?

                          CAROL

           Right. Yeah. You saw her lying there, right ?

                          JACK

           Yes, she was lying on the floor.

                          CAROL

           You said... Yeah, but... but you're, you-re sure it was

           her, right ?

                          LARRY

           Hey, he said it was lying on the floor. Right. Right. You

           know, I... He's sure. He's sure. He's sure.

                          JACK

           She was in that bag. Yeah.

                          LARRY

           My-My-My wife's been having some bad dreams, and she

           doesn't know what she's talking about.

                          CAROL

           Okay, look. Yeah, yeah.

          Larry gives some banknotes to Jack.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, this is, this is for all the times I call you to fix

           the faucet, and you show up six months late.

                          JACK

           Thanks.

          THEATER - AUDIENCE HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Full shot of the audience watching the show. We hear music. In the

          forefront, Carol and Larry. Larry is taping his chin with the

          program. Carol turns toward Larry and starts whispering.

                          CAROL

           The super is a drunk. I know, but, we've seen him smelling

           of Jack Daniel's, remember ?

                          LARRY

           Yeah, but...

                          CAROL

           I mean, I know he didn't see Mrs. House, Larry.

                          LARRY

           If she's a twin, it's a different story. But you don't seem

           to feel she is, so...

                          CAROL

           Well, I don't know. Oh, I know. Unless he's in on it.

                          LARRY

           Who's in on it ? The super ? The super can't change a fuse.

          The lady, sitting next to Larry, just gave the couple a bad look,

          and Carol taps on Larry's arm.

                          CAROL

           Shh !... Shh !...

          A short pause.

                          CAROL

           I mean, she...

                          LARRY

           What ?

                          CAROL

           Well, she's alive. And my question is, who was in that bag.

           I mean, somebody...

                          LARRY

           She's not alive, unless she's a twin. Okay ? Now keep

           quiet...

                          CAROL

           Look, somebody... Somebody got cremated, Larry. Somebody.

                          LARRY

           Shut up.

          NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Long shot of Ted and Carol walking toward us in a quiet street.

          Actually it is the street where the wine-tasting lounge is

          located, and, of course, the street where Carol saw the bus with

          Lilian on board of it. They walk near the entrance of the

          National Arts Club. Ted is holding a small notebook and looking

          at what is has written in it.

                          CAROL

           Right.

                          TED

           Uh, maiden name, Lillian Beagle. Born in Carlyle,

           Pennsylvania, nineteen-thirty-five. Married Paul Richard

           House.

                          CAROL

           Right, I know.

                          TED

           She was not a twin. Had an older sister who...

                          CAROL

           So goes Larry's theory.

                          TED

           Uh, went to England twenty years ago, and an older brother

           who died in nineteen-eighty-seven.

          Carol stops in front of the building next to the National Arts

          Club. It is the building where they had the wine-tasting session

          the day before.

                          CAROL

           Right here. This is it.

                          TED

           This is where we were.

          The camera tilts up to show the window behind which Carol was

          sitting the day before.

           CAROL (voice over)

           This is where we were. I know. And I was sitting right

           here, after you left.

          The camera tilts back down to Ted and Carol.

                          TED

           Right.

                          CAROL

           And I was having a glass of, you kn-you know, wine, and I

           looked out the window, and-and I saw the... right here.

          Carol shows Ted the spot where she saw the bus.

                          TED

           You saw her after I left ?

                          CAROL

           Yes, I saw... her on a bus. It was passing. You... It was,

           like.

          She walks in the middle of the street.

                          TED

           Wait a minute. Are you... You're absolutely sure you saw

           her ? You saw her face ?

                          CAROL

           I'm positive I-I saw her.

          A car is honking. Carol, still standing in the middle of the

          street, moves out of the way of the car.

                          CAROL

           Whoo !... Excuse me. I-I'm telling you, Ted.

          Ted joins Carol in the middle of the street.

                          TED

           What was the number of the bus ?

                          CAROL

           Uh, I don't know what the number of the bus was, but I know

           that it was heading west to east, so it was... it obviously

           was a cross-town bus.

                          TED

           All right. Okay, look, look. It's a cross-town bus.

          They walk to the sidewalk on the other side of the street, where

          the park is located.

                          CAROL

           Right.

                          TED

           Okay, so look. The end of the line is a few blocks down

           there.

                          CAROL

           So, okay. So, then, it's like...

                          TED

           So, she... She had to get off somewhere... somewhere.

                          CAROL

           Then... Her destination was probably within the next five

           or six blocks.

          They start walking on the sidewalk, going the way where they first

          came from.

                          TED

           Yeah, right. So, let's, let's look around. Let's, we, we'll

           see some, you know, uh, like a, like a, you know... clue,

           or something. Or something. Maybe we'll see her. You're

           sure you saw her face ?

                          CAROL

           Don't, don't doubt me, okay ?

                          TED

           Okay, okay, okay. No, no, no, no.

                          CAROL

           I'm-I'm not kidding. Look.

          NEW-YORK - A WIDE AVENUE - EXTERIOR DAY

          This is not a nice area anymore. It is a wide dingy-looking

          avenue, with the nearest buildings very far away and a road bridge

          over the street. And it is raining.

          Long shot of the avenue, with Carol and Ted walking further away.

                          CAROL

           Oh, God. Well, I think, you know, I think we've reached the

           end of the line.

                          TED

           I think this is it.

          A bus is coming toward them.

                          CAROL

           Look. The bus.

          The bus slows down.

                          TED

           I don't think... there's noth... Watch out. Watch out.

          Ted pushes Carol so she doesn't get soaked by the bus driving very

          close to the sidewalk and into the pools of rain.

                          CAROL

           Yeah, what ? Oh. Whoo !...

          The bus makes a U-turn on the avenue.

                          TED

           Yeah, look. See ? See, he's turning. That's it.

                          CAROL

           Yeah, I know.

                          TED

           That's all there is, here.

                          CAROL

           Well, what do you think ?

                          RED

           What ?

                          CAROL

           Do you think we should retrace our steps ?

          NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY

          They are back in the same street where the wine-tasting place is

          located.

          Full shot of the park across the street, seen across the thick

          vertical bars of the railings that surround the park. Ted and

          Carol are walking on a lane in the park.

                          TED

           You-you wear a tie with a dress. It's a... It's a very

           special...

          The camera follows Ted and Carol, moving on the other side of the

          railings.

                          CAROL

           No, I don't think it looks good, and I don't even know if

           it looks... I mean, I feel like it'd be to masculine if I

           wore it with a pair of pants.

                          TED

           Oh, it'd look great on you. No, no, just don't wear it with

           pants.

                          CAROL

           Oh.

                          TED

           With pants, it's-it's... what ?

          Carol has just stopped walking, and she is looking at something on

          the other side of the railings.

                          CAROL

           Ted, look.

                          TED

           At what ? What ?

          The camera pans around to a reverse angle shot of the other side

          of the street. It stops on a building. On the awning above the

          entrance of the building is written : Hotel Waldron. The camera

          stops on that shot and doesn't move anymore.

           CAROL (voice over)

           That hotel.

           TED (voice over)

           What about it?

           CAROL (voice over)

           Well, that's... the Waldron. I mean, I thou... I-I was in

           his apartment, I pressed the number... last number

           dialed, and...

           TED (voice over)

           You're kidding.

           CAROL (voice over)

           And they answered the phone. And said... Waldron.

           TED (voice over)

           Let's-Let's-Let's get to a phone. Let's get to a phone.

           Let's call up. You got a quarter ?

          Medium shot of Ted talking into the handset of a pay-phone on the

          street.

                          TED

           Hallo ? Mrs. House, please ? Mrs... Mrs. House. Can you

           ring her room for me, please ?

          The camera pans to Carol, standing in the street near Ted.

                          TED

           Really ?

                          CAROL

           Well ?

                          TED

           What. Maybe... Well, maybe she checked out. No-nobody,

           nobody at all. Uh... What about...?

                          CAROL

           Wh-What about...

                          TED

           Yeah, what about, uh, Helen Moss, Moss. You're sure ?

           Nobody... nobody at all. All-All right. All right, okay.

           I'm sorry. All right. Thank you. thank you.

                          CAROL

           Great. Oh, God. It looks like it's gonna rain again. Well ?

          A RESTAURANT - INTERIOR DAY

          Full shot on a restaurant. This part of the restaurant is empty.

          Only two people, Larry and Marcia, are seated at a table behind a

          set of crossed wooden bars, on the other side of which the camera

          is located. Apparently Marcia is teaching Larry how to play poker.

          Marcia wears sunglasses and has a cigarette stuck between her

          lips.

                          MARCIA

           If I get two kings, I take one. Otherwise, I fold.

                          LARRY

           So...

                          MARCIA

           Got it ?

                          LARRY

           I-I never go out. I-I-I-I-I just, I can't take... I

           can't...

          Marcia shuffles the cards.

                          MARCIA

           That's how you wind up on welfare.

          The camera pans away from the two players to another section of

          the restaurant, where a few people are still eating. It looks like

          a very good restaurant, with waiters dressed with white shirt and

          black vest.

           LARRY (voice over)

           You know, I need the action, for some reason. I-I can't...

           I bet anything. Okay, just...

           MARCIA (voice over)

           Cut ?

           LARRY (voice over)

           No, no, go ahead, I trust you. Lay it on me.

          The camera pans back on Larry and Marcia. This is a different

          shot, with the camera in front of their table. Marcia seems very

          relaxed with the cards in her hands, when Larry seems quite

          nervous. He holds the card very close to his eyes, seeming afraid

          that his partner will look at them.

                          MARCIA

           You seem in a strange mood.

                          LARRY

           No, no, no. I'm just probably just a little drunk.

                          MARCIA

           On Perrier ?

                          LARRY

           No. What are you talking about ? I had rum cake.

                          MARCIA

           Want any cards ?

          Larry shuffles his cards in his hand, hesitating on his next move.

                          LARRY

           Uh, one second. Just let me, let me see, see what I,

           possibilities I got here. Uh, yeah. I'm gonna have, uh...

           I'll have, uh... I'm gonna have four cards.

                          MARCIA

           Four ?

                          LARRY

           Yeah.

          She gives him his four cards.

                          MARCIA

           Cruising for a bruising.

                          LARRY

           Inside and outside straight.

          Marcia looks at her cards. Larry keeps shuffling his cards very

          nervously.

                          MARCIA

           You're in trouble, now.

                          LARRY

           You know, I can't escape the feeling that my-my wife is

           becoming attracted to somebody else... and it's really

           bothering me.

                          MARCIA

           Really.

                          LARRY

           Yeah. That's why I'm not playing my best. This guy is, you

           know, more adventurous than I am, and for some reason they

           just seem to hit it off. I'm gonna be very lonely if, uh,

           you know, if this happens.

                          MARCIA

           You must love her a lot.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, I do. I do.

                          MARCIA

           Um... if you want to hold on to her, you have to make some

           effort. I mean, who's the guy ?

                          LARRY

           Uh, Ted. The guy that I fixed you up with.

                          MARCIA

           Ted.

                          LARRY

           Yeah.

                          MARCIA

           Well, we could always switch. Ted gets Carol, I can be your

           date.

                          LARRY

           Maybe-Maybe I should actually make a greater effort with-

           with Carol.

          NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY

          Full shot of the entrance of the Waldron Hotel. The pavement is

          wet but it doesn't seem to rain anymore. The camera pans to a car

          parked on the other side of the street a short distance from the

          hotel. This is Larry's car, with Larry seated behind the wheel and

          Carol seated on the passenger's seat. Medium shot of the inside of

          the car, seen through the open window.

                          CAROL

           So, you bored ? I mean...

                          LARRY

           Well, it's more fun than the Wagner opera.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. Well, to me, I mean, just... I mean, it's just one of

           the most exciting adventures I've ever been on.

                          LARRY

           Would you rather be here with Ted ?

                          CAROL

           Well-Well, he has a more enthused attitude, Larry. I...

                          LARRY

           More enthused ?

                          CAROL

           Yeah, enthused, yeah.

                          LARRY

           Well, he's a fun guy. He's a light guy, I'm a heavy guy.

                          CAROL

           Well, I...

                          LARRY

           You know, Ted-Ted would be fun on a scavenger hunt.

                          CAROL

           No, look. I... Larry, you used to be a lot of fun.

                          LARRY

           You know, he's the guy you want if you have a really heavy

           scavenger hunt. He's the man.

                          CAROL

           I know, well, but, y-you know. You used to...

                          LARRY

           Do you know that this neighborhood was where I first took

           you out on a date when we-we first started going out.

                          CAROL

           What ? I don't know. I don't know. Just for some reason,

           you've gotten so stodgy in your old age, you know ?

                          LARRY

           Hey, you remember there was a movie house right on this

           corner.

                          CAROL

           No, I know. Yes ! Yeah, I remember.

                          LARRY

           Not to change the subject.

                          CAROL

           You know, I...

                          LARRY

           I took you to see Last year at Marienbad on our first

           date ?

                          CAROL

           Yeah, I know. I had to explain it to you for the next six

           months.

                          LARRY

           Who knew they were flashbacks ? You know.

                          CAROL

           Look, Larry. Look. We've got plenty of time to be

           conservative. You know what I'm saying ? Don't you see ?

          The camera starts moving around the car.

                          CAROL

           It's to me, it's like this-this tantalizing plum has just,

           like dropped into our laps. I mean, life is just such a

           dull routine and here we are, right ? I mean, we're on the

           threshold of a genuine mystery. I mean, to me, the whole

           thing is like. It's... Hey, no.

          The camera stops moving on another medium shot, where we still see

          Larry through his open window, but we see Carol only through the

          wet windshield.

                          LARRY

           Are you gonna burst into a song, here ? We're in a car.

                          CAROL

           Just don't make fun of me, okay ? Because I'm open to new

           experiences.

                          LARRY

           Let me ask you a personal question, here.

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           Did you ever sleep with Ted ?

                          CAROL

           Sleep ?

                          LARRY

           Don't get nervous. Yeah. Yeah, you guys...

                          CAROL

           What, are you nuts ?

                          LARRY

           We were on an eating tour of France, together.

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           You two guys spent an evening, you know, together.

                          CAROL

           Yeah, right. We sp...

                          LARRY

           At that place, you know.

                          CAROL

           I know... Yeah, but what about you ? Remember ? You spent

           the evening with Julie. Am I right ? You spent the night,

           and shared a...

                          LARRY

           That meant absolutely nothing. She hated me. Julie despised

           me.

                          CAROL

           What ?

                          LARRY

           You know that. She-She thought I was a low-life and a wimp

           and a vermin and a roach. Just-Just jump in anytime you

           want to defend me, you know.

                          CAROL

           Hey, I mean, I'm waiting for you to say something I don't

           agree with, okay ?

                          LARRY

           Ho-ho ! Hey, you're nailing me... Jesus !...

          He stops smiling because he just saw something in front of his

          car, something we don't yet see, because the camera hasn't moved

          from its position.

                          CAROL

           Oh. Larry.

                          LARRY

           Yeah.

          The camera starts panning very rapidly toward the entrance of the

          hotel.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Larry, Larry, look. It's her ! I'd say it's her !

          A lady carrying a white open umbrella is entering the hotel.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Oh my god, it is.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Yeah. You see what I mean ? See, so I was right all along,

           wasn't I ?

           LARRY (voice over)

           Can you... Are you sure ? Are you sure ?

           CAROL (voice over)

           I'm positive. Yes.

          The camera starts panning back toward Larry's car.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Oh, my God.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Right ? Right ? I mean, I was...

          Medium shot of Larry and Carol in the car, seen through Larry's

          open window.

                          LARRY

           I'm... Jesus, I'm sh...

                          CAROL

           I know. W-Well. Come on.

                          LARRY

           That is her. Are you...

                         CAROL

          Yeah. I know.

                         LARRY

          I told you so.

                         CAROL

          What do you mean, you told me so ? What are you talking

          about ? You're nuts, honey.

                         LARRY

          Oh, Jesus. I'm flabbergasted.

                         CAROL

          Yeah. No, look. You're white. You're completely white.

                         LARRY

          I know. All the blood rushed to my brother.

                         CAROL

          Larry !

                         LARRY

          I don't know what to do.

                         CAROL

          Let's go. Let's get out there. Let's find out what's going

          on.

                         LARRY

          No, I don't want to.

                         CAROL

          Oh, come on. Y-You're not afraid of her, are you ?

                         LARRY

          No, I'm not afraid.

                         CAROL

          You're not afraid of Mrs. House.

                         LARRY

          She's an old woman and I'm a virile male.

                         CAROL

          I know.

                         LARRY

          And yet somehow I am scared. I don't know why. Maybe

          because she's dead. You know ?

                         CAROL

          Let's go. You know, I tell you, I'm gonna break this thing

          wide open.

                         LARRY

          Well, how ? What do you want to do ?

                         CAROL

          I'm... You know, I'm... God, if only Ted were here with us

           now. You know what I'm saying ?

                          LARRY

           Oh, don't give me Ted ! Wh... Let's... Let's... Wh... Let's

           get out of here.

                          CAROL

           No, wait. I got an idea.

                          LARRY

           What ?

                          CAROL

           I know what we should do. We should get a gift, right ?

                          LARRY

           What ?

          Carol gets out of the car.

                          CAROL

           We'll surprise her. We'll sneak into the hotel. Come on.

                          LARRY

           How ? How ?

                          CAROL

           Yeah, no. Come on.

          Larry gets out of the car.

          HOTEL WALDRON - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

          A modern clean lobby, with a very conventional decoration. Medium

          shot of a clerk cleaning the lobby floor with a broom. She is a

          woman in her forties, very casually dressed with a flowered blouse

          and a beige sweater, and with uncombed hair hanging on her

          shoulders.

          The camera pans around toward the street door. Carol enters the

          lobby, followed by Larry. Carol is holding a small present-wrapped

          parcel in her hand and walks toward the clerk.

                          CAROL

           Uh, excuse me. Hi.

           HOTEL DAY CLERK

           Hi.

                          CAROL

           Um, we were just wondering. Uh, did you see a woman come

           in ? She was, uh, she was a little woman, about five foot

           three ? She had on a gray sweater ?

           HOTEL DAY CLERK

           Older woman ?

                          LARRY

           And came in with a-with a canvas bag, and an umbrella.

                          CAROL

           Slightly older. Not...

           HOTEL DAY CLERK

           Mrs. Caine ?

                          LARRY

           Mrs. Caine ?

                          CAROL

           Mrs. Caine. Oh, yes. Uh-huh. That's her.

                          LARRY

           Mrs. Caine. Uh-huh.

                          CAROL

           Yes.

          Larry takes the parcel from Carol's hand.

                          LARRY

           We-We had a present for her. We're friends. We-We wanted to

           surprise her, because it's her birthday, so-so...

          He gives the parcel back to Carol.

           HOTEL DAY CLERK

           Oh.

                          CAROL

           Yes, that's right. What room ?

           HOTEL DAY CLERK

           Uh, six-eleven.

                          CAROL

           Six-eleven. Really, thanks a lot.

           HOTEL DAY CLERK

           Okay. Sure.

          Carols walks away, but Larry stays with the clerk. He takes a

          banknote out of his pocket.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, we-we may need some information, while we're here,

           so-so, we just want you to know... I'll take very good care

           of you, if you play ball with us.

          He gives the banknote to the clerk, who seems a bit surprised by

          Larry's attitude and present. She looks at the banknote.

                          LARRY

           What are you making that face for ? He's the father of our

           country.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Will you come on ?

          Larry walks toward Carol, who is waiting for the elevator.

                          LARRY

           I'm coming, I'm coming.

                          CAROL

           Come on. What're you doing ?

          HOTEL WALDRON - SIXTH FLOOR HALLWAY - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot on the elevator door opening. Carol walks out,

          followed by Larry, who closes the door. Carol starts looking

          around for room numbers. The camera follows them

                          CAROL

           Okay. Um, six-eleven. Six-oh-seven.

          The camera stops at the beginning of a long narrow corridor. Carol

          and Larry walk along the corridor, away from the camera.

                          LARRY

           Huh. Very nice. I love a hotel that's got lots of blue

           powder sprinkled along the baseboard.

                          CAROL

           Six-eleven. Here, Larry. All right.

          They have stopped walking at the end of the corridor, in front of

          a door. Carol knocks on that door.

                          CAROL

           Um, Mrs. House ?

                          LARRY

           Mrs. House ?

          Carol knocks louder on the door, helped by Larry. Under Larry's

          fist, the door opens slowly.

          HOTEL WALDRON - ROOM 611 - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium close shot on the door, that opens slowly.

           CAROL (voice over)

           M-Mrs. House ?

           LARRY (voice over)

           Hallo ?

          Carol enters the room, followed by Larry.

                          CAROL

           Hallo ? Mrs. Hou...

                          LARRY

           I don't... I don't...

                          CAROL

           My God, I don't...

                          LARRY

           I don't think she's...

          The camera starts panning around the room, up to the window, then

          starts panning back toward Carol and Larry.

           CAROL (voice over)

           I don't see her.

           LARRY (voice over)

           This may not be the right-right place.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Just hold on, Larry. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

          The camera is back on Carol and Larry. Larry is looking inside a

          closet.

                          LARRY

           There's nothing here.

          He closes the closet door. Carol yells.

                          CAROL

           Ahhh ! Larry !

          She runs to the beds and look down on the floor between the two

          twin beds. She drops the parcel on the floor.

                          LARRY

           What's the matter ?

                          CAROL

           Oh, my God ! Wait a minute !

                          LARRY

           Oh, Jesus.

          Carol kneels down on the floor, bending on something she just saw

          on the floor. The camera follows her movement and we see a human

          hand resting on the floor, the rest of the body being hidden by

          one of the bed.

                          CAROL

           Oh, my God, look ! Mrs. House ? Mrs. House ?

                          LARRY

           What's the matter ?

                          CAROL

           Hallo ?

                          LARRY

           What-What-What...

                          CAROL

           Mrs...Oh, Larry.

                          LARRY

           What? What-What's...

          Carol, still kneeling on the floor, straightens up and looks at

          Larry.

                          CAROL

           I think she's dead.

                          LARRY

           Dead ? T-T-Try-Try giving her the present.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. Oh, my God. Mrs. House ? Mrs. House ?

                          LARRY

           Oh, come on ! Let's get out of here !

                          CAROL

           I think that's it, Larry. I think she's dead !

                          LARRY

           Come on. Let's get out of here.

          He helps Carol to stand up.

                          CAROL

           Oh, my God.

                          LARRY

           I'm thinking of running the Boston marathon.

          They both start running out of the room.

                          CAROL

           Oh, God. Okay, oh God.

                          LARRY

           This woman is forever dying.

          HOTEL WALDRON - SIXTH FLOOR HALLWAY - INTERIOR DAY

          Same shot of the long corridor as before. We see Carol and Larry

          coming out Room 611 and running toward us.

                          LARRY

           Come on, come on. Move, move. Adrenaline is leaking out of

           my ears.

          They reach the end of the corridor, and the camera follows them as

          they run around the corner of the hallway.

                          LARRY

           Get down those stairs.

          They don't use the elevator and instead run down the stairs.

                          CAROL

           Okay, all right.

                          LARRY

           Come on, come on. Quickly.

          NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY

          Long shot of the entrance of the hotel, seen from the other side

          of the street. A blue police car is parked in front of the hotel.

          Two plainclothes police officers and one uniformed policeman are

          talking with Carol and Larry. They both try to explain the

          situation to the police officers. But since they both talk

          together, the police officers have a hard time understanding them.

          While they are talking, the camera zooms forward from a long shot

          to a full shot of the group.

           CAROL (talking together with Larry)

           And then, you see, what happened was I suspected Mr. House,

           right ? He's a... He runs a movie house. But-But then what

           hap... We're sit... I saw her on this bus, right ? And...

           And she has... no place at all. Then we checked anyway. So

           we were just sitting there, just waiting...

           LARRY (talking together with Carol)

           We-We-We were there. She-She was very nervous. So-So we

           were going to the movies, and, and, and we were walking and

           looking around the place. And then suddenly she's a... Her

           hand is on the floor. You could see it on the side of the

           bed. She was lying there, she was sort of... like blue in

           the face. The girl was nervous. I tried to keep calm, as

           best as I could.

          One of the plainclothes police officers stops their talking.

           FIRST POLICE OFFICER

           There's nobody up there.

                          CAROL

           There's what ?

                          LARRY

           What do you mean, there's nobody up...

           FIRST POLICE OFFICER

           There's nobody.

                          CAROL

           Wait a minute, wait...

           SECOND POLICE OFFICER

           There's no body there.

                          CAROL

           We-We saw...

                          LARRY

           We just saw her there. She's lying on the floor.

                          CAROL

           We...

           SECOND POLICE OFFICER (talking to the uniformed policeman)

           Mike, check the basement with...

          He starts climbing the few steps to the entrance of the hotel,

          followed by Carol and Larry. The other police officer remains on

          the sidewalk.

                          LARRY

           She was totally dead.

                          CAROL

           We... She's there.

                          LARRY

           Wait, wait.

          HOTEL WALDRON - ROOM 611 - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium close shot of an uniformed policeman, different from the

          one we just saw in the street.

           CAROL (voice over)

           She was right here. She was lying, like, right this-a-way.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Yeah, she was definitely laying here.

          The camera pans from the uniformed policeman to the two police

          officers talking with Carol and Larry in the middle of the room.

          The following dialogue transcript separates what Larry says from

          what Carol says, but, most of the time, they talk together at the

          same time, making it quite difficult for us, or for the police

          officers, to follow their conversation.

                          CAROL

           Because, I mean, she was, she was there, do you

           understand ?

          The camera tilts down on one of the police officers looking under

          the bed.

                          LARRY

           The... Y-Yes. She was... It looked like she was strangled,

           or something. Not-Not that I'm an expert on violent death,

           because I wouldn't know.

                          CAROL

           We're-We're two professional people.

                          LARRY

           Right, I'm a... I-I work at Harper's.

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           I'm in publishing.

                          CAROL

           Yeah, that's right, and I'm-I'm looking to start a little

           restaurant, basically French, although international

           cuisine would be fine. Not that I really have a location...

                          LARRY

           Right, she's a fantastic cook. But, uh, I'm against the

           restaurant, myself, but-but she's a wonderful cook.

           FIRST POLICE OFFICER

           Calm down. Calm down ! Please !

                          CAROL

           Okay, just...

                          LARRY

           Look, obviously what happened is, in the time it took you

           guys to respond... somebody came here and removed the body.

           Not that you didn't respond quickly, you know, you were

           here fast. It took-took you three minutes, not-not-not

           counting the half-hour that the operator 911 took to

           understand what I was saying.

           FIRST POLICE OFFICER

           Nobody is doubting you, okay ? We're going over the whole

           building, all right ?

                          CAROL

           All right.

          NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of Carol, Larry, the first plainclothes police officer

          and the uniformed policeman we first saw in the street.

                          CAROL

           Uh, did you check...

           FIRST POLICE OFFICER

           Mr. House...

          The second plainclothes police officer joins the group.

           SECOND POLICE OFFICER

           ...He's been at his place of business all day.

                          LARRY

           Any witnesses ?

                          CAROL

           Yeah, b...

           SECOND POLICE OFFICER

           Uh-huh, backed up and corroborated.

                          CAROL

           Yeah, but you didn't use our names, or anything like that,

           did you ?

           SECOND POLICE OFFICER

           No, we didn't.

                          CAROL

           No, okay.

           SECOND POLICE OFFICER

           I don't know. If you think you saw his wife, shouldn't you

           tell him ?

                          CAROL

           No, I'm... No, I mean, he's in some sort of scheme, here.

           It's...

           FIRST POLICE OFFICER

           We think you should calm down and file a report.

                          CAROL

           It's not... Oh !

           FIRST POLICE OFFICER

           This way, if anything turns up, we got it on record.

          He gives his business card to Larry.

                          CAROL

           All right.

           FIRST POLICE OFFICER

           Take a card, give us a call, have a good day.

                          CAROL

           Thank you. Thanks very much.

           SECOND POLICE OFFICER

           Bye-bye.

          The two police officers walk away with the uniformed policeman.

          Larry looks at the card in his hand.

                          CAROL

           Thanks very much. Oh, man, I don't know how we're gonna...

                          LARRY

           Jesus, I gotta have a drink. I gotta calm myself. I need

           fourteen Zanacks or something.

                          CAROL

           Where is Ted ? I just don't understand where Ted is. I

           mean, you know, all this stuff is happening.

          They start walking away on the sidewalk, while the police officers

          are climbing in their car.

                          LARRY

           Ted ? Ted-Ted's, you know, he's got his date with Marcia

           Fox tonight. He's probably out buying some Spanish Fly.

                          CAROL

           Do you think Helen Moss might be in on this ?

                          LARRY

           Helen ? I don't know and...

                          CAROL

           I think so.

                          LARRY

           I don't want to know about this. I think we should change

           our lives.

                          CAROL

           No, think about it.

                          LARRY

           We should move out of that stupid apartment, you know. You

           know, start over maybe in Mexico.

                          CAROL

           No, no, no.

                          LARRY

           You know, sell blankets. We'll work off the hood of a car

           or something.

          A CAFETERIA - INTERIOR DAY

          Full shot of a classical New-York cafeteria. Rows of table on

          either side of the room, each table surrounded by beige imitation-

          leather twin seats. Another row of table in the middle of the

          room, with chairs around them. Huge electrical fans hanging from

          the ceiling.

          The camera pans on the left to a medium shot of the table around

          which Larry and Carol are seated. They are drinking beer.

                          CAROL

           I'm just beginning to calm down.

                          LARRY

           I'm telling you, I didn't know what's happening. It was

           like one of those television shows, where you open the

           door, and you see a-a dead body. You know, I always hated

           those shows.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. You know, I've never seen a dead person before in my

           whole life.

                          LARRY

           I... The only one I ever saw was my uncle Morris, who was

           ninety-four years old.

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           He collapsed from too many lumps in his cereals.

                          CAROL

           Larry, is this the most exciting thing that's ever happened

           to us in our whole marriage ?

                          LARRY

           This is too exciting. I don't need this. You know, I like

           something quiet... like a fishing trip, a Father's day, you

           know, or, the time we saw Bing Crosby walking on 5th

           avenue. You know, I don't need a murder to enliven my life

           at all.

                          CAROL

           You know, whoever did it was probably still in the room

           while we were there. Probably hiding in the closet.

                          LARRY

           Make sure and tell me that just before I go to sleep,

           tonight. That'll be good for me.

                          CAROL

           But you know, that probably means he saw us.

                          LARRY

           Great, I'll never get my eyes closed. You know, I mean,

           what do you want me to do ? I'm petrified. Not only that,

           but I'm a little drunk.

                          CAROL

           I wonder who was cremated. Who was it ?

                          LARRY

           Well, it was... Well... You know, obviously, it wasn't Mr.

           House, because he has an alibi.

                          CAROL

           Well, yeah, but I don't buy that.

                          LARRY

           She doesn't buy that. She doesn't buy the alibi. Let's get

           out of here. I want to go home.

          NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Full shot of Carol and Larry walking toward us. It is very dark

          and the sidewalks are wet from a recent rain.

                          LARRY

           Jesus, it's starting to rain again. Can you believe that ?

                          CAROL

           Oh, God. If only Ted were with us, he'd have a million

           theories about this, I'll tell you that.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, I know. I know. Ted's got a mind like a steel sieve.

                          CAROL

           Oh, right.

          The camera hasn't moved, so now we get a medium shot of Larry and

          Carol. They have reached their car, and Carol walks around it to

          get into the passenger's seat.

                          LARRY

           You know what I think ? I think it's possible. That hotel

           room was on the, on the ext... That end of the hall.

          The camera tilts up the facade of the Waldron Hotel.

           CAROL (voice over)

           What ? Yeah ?

           LARRY (voice over)

           It's right up there. That's the room.

           CAROL (voice over)

           I know.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Well, what if they got the body out over that little roof ?

           You know, that would be a possibility. Why would...

          The two windows, which Larry is pointing at, suddenly get lit.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Ohhh !... What are the lights...

           LARRY (voice over)

           Oh, Jesus.

          The camera tilts back down to street level. Larry and Carol are

          around their car, ready to climb in.

                          CAROL

           Larry, the lights !

                          LARRY

           Yeah, that's eerie, isn't it ?

                          CAROL

           My God. This gave me the chills, honey.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, well, let's call the police.

                          CAROL

           I mean... Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Let's go over there now.

           Let's check it out. Come on. We don't have time.

                          LARRY

           Check it out ?

                          CAROL

           Yes.

                          LARRY

           What, are you nuts ? No, I'm not gonna check that out.

                          CAROL

           No, but look at it, Larry. Look at that. There's lights

           going on, there.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, I know, I know. That's crazy. Look, look. Why don't

           we go home and nap, and we'll call the police, and they can

           check it out while we're home in the... ?

          Carol walks away from the car toward the hotel.

                          CAROL

           Oh, no, the police are red tape. Come on. This is my case,

           honey.

          Larry catches up with her. The camera remains on the sidewalk,

          looking at the couple walking toward the hotel.

                          LARRY

           What do you mean, it's your case ?

                          CAROL

           Yes, it's my case.

                          LARRY

           Hey, come here. I don't want to do this.

                          CAROL

           No, come on.

                          LARRY

           No.

                          CAROL

           Oh, God. If only Ted were with us.

                          LARRY

           Hey, don't give me Ted. Ted would be shaking in his boots.

                          CAROL

           Ted... Oh, God.

                          LARRY

           I'm at least just trembling like a leaf.

          They have reached the hotel and they are climbing the steps to the

          entrance of the hotel.

          HOTEL WALDRON - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium close shot on a window set in the wall of the lobby. Behind

          the window, the night clerk is sorting some paper. There is a

          grill in the window, to allow people to to talk to the clerk.

          Carol and Larry walk to the window.

                          CAROL

           Um, excuse me. We're with the Police department. We'd like

           to, uh, check out room, uh, six-eleven, please ?

          Larry tries to play the part of the relaxed policeman doing his

          job, but he overdoes it and he looks more bizarre than serious.

           HOTEL NIGHT CLERK

           You were here before.

                          CAROL

           Uh, that's right. Yes. Mm-hm. Yeah.

           HOTEL NIGHT CLERK

           You are Police ?

                          CAROL

           Ee... Ooh, um, just, uh-uh... Show him your card.

                          LARRY

           My what ?

                          CAROL

           Your-Your card. Your-Your Police identification card.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, I-I...

                          CAROL

           Your card, you know. Your card. He's got his card.

          Larry goes through the pockets of his jacket and gets the business

          card the police officer gave him. He shows it to the clerk and

          then slides it through a small rectangular hole at the bottom of

          the window. The clerk takes it and looks at it.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. See ?

           HOTEL NIGHT CLERK

           Okay.

          The clerk gives the card back to Carol.

                          CAROL

           Thank you very much. Six-eleven ? Okay. Great.

          The clerks goes and gets the key of the room. He gives it to

          Carol, who drops the card on the small counter under the window.

           HOTEL NIGHT CLERK

           Is there any trouble ?

                          LARRY

           No, no, no, no, no. I-m-I'm-I'm-I'm j... I'm-I'm ju...

           um... I'm a detective. They-They-They lowered the height

           requirements, so I... I'll take this card back. They-re,

           they're...

          He takes the card from the counter and puts it back in the inside

          pocket of his jacket.

                          CAROL

           Come on.

                          LARRY

           ...expensive.

          Carol walks toward the elevator and Larry follows her.

          HOTEL WALDRON - SIXTH FLOOR HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT

          As before, the camera is located at one end of the long corridor,

          showing Larry and Carol at the other end of the corridor ready to

          enter Room 611. Larry keeps looking around while Carol is opening

          the door.

          HOTEL WALDRON - ROOM 611 - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Full shot of the room with the door in the background. The door is

          opening slowly. Carol enters the room, followed by Larry

                          CAROL

           Okay.

                          LARRY

           Be careful.

                          CAROL

           Telling me to be careful. Now, just don't upset anything.

           Okay, Larry ?

          Larry closes the door.

                          LARRY

           I'm not upsetting anything. I just, you know, I'm just

           gonna leave a-a set of fingerprints around, so if there's a

           trial, we can get trapped.

          The camera follows Carol and Larry moving around the room.

                          CAROL

           All right, now look. The murderer must have, like, hid in

           this closet, right ?

          Carol opens a closet.

                          LARRY

           I don't like this.

          Carol gives a quick peek inside the closet, and then closes it.

                          CAROL

           Right, and then he must have...

                          LARRY

           Let's go. You know, I've got to get up early tomorrow. I've

           got to be in temple.

                          CAROL

           Okay, he must have dragged the b... The body out, really

           fast. What ?

          We hear a click coming from the door of the room.

                          LARRY

           Shhh !...

          Larry picks up a metal lamp from the floor and hides behind a

          closet in front of the door with Carol behind him. The door opens

          and the cleaning lady walks in with her bucket and things. Larry

          is ready to hit her, but, when he realizes who she is, he drops

          the lamp. The cleaning lady yells.

                          CLEANING LADY

           Ahhh !... Oh, Jesus! What...

                          LARRY

           I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm... Didn't mea... I-I, oh, it's-

           It's-It's a...

                          CAROL

           Oh, hi.

          Larry opens the door and pushes the lady out of the room.

                          LARRY

           You don't have to turn the bed out. It's not necessary. And

           no-no-no croissants tomorrow for breakfast.

          He takes some money out of his pocket and gives it to her.

                          LARRY

           Here, here. Here, take this for yourself. I like the

           towels. Keep the little mints coming on the pillow, uh...

          He closes the door.

                          CAROL

           Oh, Jesus. Larry. I mean, really.

                          LARRY

           Let's go. That's why the light was on. This is crazy, we're

           gonna get in trouble.

                          CAROL

           Just a second, Larry. Let me just look around here, just a

           little bit.

          Larry picks up the lamp which is broken in two pieces.

                          LARRY

           Oh, look. I did damage. I... Now. I'll be sued.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Oh ! Larry !

                          LARRY

           That's what ?

          Carol comes back to Larry, holding something small in her hand.

                          CAROL

           Larry, look. Look. I thinks that's her wedding band, Larry.

                          LARRY

           How do you know ?

                          CAROL

           How do I know ? I saw it on her.

                          LARRY

           You did ?

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           Jesus.

                          CAROL

           I think so.

                          LARRY

           So much for the police combing every inch of this place.

           Where did you find it ?

                          CAROL

           I found it behind the door, right there.

                          LARRY

           Oh, brother. Let's get out of here, come on. And take the

           ring with you. Maybe there's a pawnshop open.

                          CAROL

           Okay. Okay.

          Larry opens the door and they walk out of the room.

          HOTEL WALDRON - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium shot inside the cabin. The elevator is moving down.

                          CAROL

           Didn't I tell you the police weren't thorough ? I mean they

           probably thought we were cranks, right ? I mean, we got no

           body, and... I mean, they must get fifty crisis calls a

           minute. Why would they bother with us ?

                          LARRY

           I don't know. I just know, this is very deep stuff.

                          CAROL

           Just...

                          LARRY

           We should not be here. I'm scared, this is creepy. You know

           what I mean ? This goes... this could be... Who knows who's

           involved in this ? This could go very deep, Carol. This

           could be like, you know, like with the Warren commission,

           or something. I don't like it.

                          CAROL

           Oh, not the Warren Commission.

          There is a loud noise and the elevator suddenly stops.

                          CAROL

           Oh, my God !

                          LARRY

           Jesus ! What is that ?

                          CAROL

           Wait a minute. Okay, all right, now look. All right. The-

           the elevator's probably stuck.

                          LARRY

           Why are we stopping ? Why are we stopping ?

                          CAROL

           Relax now, Larry.

          Carol starts punching all the buttons on the control panel.

                          LARRY

           Don't tell me to relax ! I'm-I'm-I'm a-a world-renowned

           claustrophobic.

                          CAROL

           It's okay. It's okay, everything's going to be fine.

                          LARRY

           Stop. Hit something.

                          CAROL

           I am hitting it.

                          LARRY

           I don't like this, I don't, I don't...

                          CAROL

           I know, I know. It's okay.

                          LARRY

           It's easy for you to say, but I can't breathe, I'm phobic.

                          CAROL

           The-the idea is, there's plenty of air, in this elevator.

           Uh, Larry, relax. Now, if you just don't panic, okay ?

           Don't panic, all right ?

                          LARRY

           I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking, I'm...

                          CAROL

           Now, just don't worry.

                          LARRY

           I'm just going to say the rosary, now.

                          CAROL

           Somebody'll help us. Somebody's gonna help us. Somebody'll

           find us here. Hello !

          She hits the door with the palms of her hands.

                          LARRY

           Oh, I don't know, I don't like this.

                          CAROL

           Hello !

                          LARRY

           Say something. Stop it.

                          CAROL

           Hallo ! Hallo !

                          LARRY

           I don't like this.

                          CAROL

           Oh, God, look just...

          Larry is getting really hysterical, moving his hands nervously

          around him.

                          LARRY

           I'm running over a field, I see open meadows. I see a

           stallion.

                          CAROL

           Yes, it's...

                          LARRY

           I'm a stallion.

                          CAROL

           Shh. Shut up, Larry.

                          LARRY

           There's-There's a cool breeze passing over me.

                          CAROL

           Larry, just shut up and calm down. Just, okay ? You're

           gonna be o...

                          LARRY

           I see grass. I see dirt.

                          CAROL

           Larry, shut up ! Hallo ! Hallo !

                          LARRY

           You know, you said, you said, Act as a policeman.

                          CAROL

           I know, yeah.

                          LARRY

           I said No. You said Pretend to be a policeman. You said

           Show him your card. I said What card.

                          CAROL

           Okay, wait a minute. I know what. Here, just... Larry,

           boost me up.

                          LARRY

           You know, I ca...

          Carol points to the ceiling of the cabin.

                          CAROL

           Boost me up, and we'll get out there. We're gonna do it.

                          LARRY

           I can't get through those things.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. Yes we can. I can do it. I can loosen it.

                          LARRY

           It'll never open, they're painted shut.

                          CAROL

           No, wait. No, Larry.

                          LARRY

           They're-They're... They-They never, they... they never

           open.

                          CAROL

           Come on. All right, put your hand together. Come on. Put

           your hand together.

                          LARRY

           I'm breathing.

                          CAROL

           No, no, it's okay.

                          LARRY

           I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

                          CAROL

           Larry !

                          LARRY

           I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

                          CAROL

           Larry, I mean, it's just... All I have to do is loosen

           that, okay.

                          LARRY

           I'm fainting because the-there's...

          Carol takes Larry's hands and joins them together.

                          CAROL

           All right, put your hand together. Put you hand together.

           Now give me a boost, okay ?

                          LARRY

           Oh, Jesus !

                          CAROL

           All right, you ready ?

          She puts a foot on Larry's hands.

                          CAROL

           Wait a second ! Wait, wait !

          Close shot on Larry's distorted face. We see Carol's body going

          up.

                          LARRY

           Oh, Jesus, you've got to cut down on those rich desserts.

                          CAROL

           Oh, wait a minute, now ! Oh, just wait ! Wait, wait !

                          LARRY

           Let's go, my life is passing in front of my eyes. The worst

           part of it is, I'm driving a used car.

                          CAROL

           Okay, now you'd think they'd loosen this stupid thing.

          Medium close shot on the ceiling of the cabin. Carol is trying to

          open a trap above the ceiling lamp.

                          LARRY

           I'm scared.

          The trap opens, and Lilian House's body comes out. Carol yells and

          falls down on the floor. The upper part of the body is hanging out

          of the trap, with its arms moving around.

                          CAROL

           Oh, my God !

                          LARRY

           Oh, my God. It's her.

          The camera tilts down to floor level and Larry and Carol.

                          CAROL

           So that's where he hid her.

                          LARRY

           Oh, Jesus. Claustrophobia and a dead body. This is a

           neurotic's jackpot.

          Suddenly, the lights switch off. The cabin is now pitch dark.

                          CAROL

           Oh ! Oh, Larry, hold on. I'm scared.

          We hear the noise of the elevator starting again.

                          LARRY

           We're going down.

                          CAROL

           Oh, God. What's happening ?

                          LARRY

           We're going down.

                          CAROL

           Oh, God, press up ! Press up !

                          LARRY

           Press up ? I can't see my hand. How can I press up ? Jesus.

                          CAROL

           We must be heading for the basement, Larry.

                          LARRY

           The basement. I want to get off in the mezzanine. I'm

           returning shoes. It's dark in here.

          We hear the noise of the elevator door opening.

                          CAROL

           What ? What are you doing ?

          Apparently Carol has come out of the elevator.

          HOTEL WALDRON - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT

          This shot is supposed to be in the basement of the hotel, but

          since it is still pitch dark, we can't tell the difference.

                          LARRY

           Where are you... I'm getting back on the elevator. I don't

           care.

                          CAROL

           I don't know where... Larry.

                          LARRY

           I-I can't see anything.

                          CAROL

           There's nothing out there. Wait a minute. What are you

           doing ?

          Larry lights a match, and we see his scared face lit by the flame

          of the match.

                          CAROL

           Hey, what are you doing with matches ?

                          LARRY

           Th-Th-These are my matches. I got them at...

                          CAROL

           Wait a minute, what... When were you at the Cafe des

           Artistes ?

          Larry blows the match, because it is burning his fingers.

                          LARRY

           Look. I got... Yeah, I was with an author. An authoress.

           At-at the... At...

                          CAROL

           At the Cafe des Artistes ?

                          LARRY

           Yeah, b... A French, a French authoress. An author.

          He lights another match. We very dimly see the basement walls

          around them.

                          CAROL

           Wait. Shh ! Shh ! Shh !

                          LARRY

           Jesus.

                          CAROL

           Try this way.

          Medium full shot of Carol and Larry walking toward us in a

          corridor. Beside the light of the match, there is some other dim

          light coming from somewhere in the basement.

                          LARRY

           I like a basement with-with knotty pine and a pool table.

           You know, where you can...

                          CAROL

           Hey, look, look, look, look. Uh-huh.

          They are now in close shot.

                          LARRY

           What ? What ?

                          CAROL

           What's this ?

                          LARRY

           I... No, wait a minute. Not so fast. I don't like it here,

           it's dank.

          The camera turns around to follow them in the corridor.

                          CAROL

           All right.

                          LARRY

           And there's strange noises. I don't know what this is. I

           don't know. This...

          We hear a loud metallic bang.

                          LARRY

           Oh, Jesus !

                          CAROL

           Calm down.

                          LARRY

           Calm down ? Don't tell me to calm down.

                          CAROL

           There. Turn the light on.

          Larry switches the light on. They are in a room with beige walls.

          There are pots of paint stacked behind Larry.

                          LARRY

           This... Wh-Wh... I-I don't... What do you...

                          CAROL

           Let me see.

          Carol tries to open a door near Larry, but it is locked.

                          CAROL

           Where... There. Oh. We're locked in here. What are you

           gonna do ?

                          LARRY

           Oh, relax, relax, relax. Don't... I'll break it down. Stand

           back.

          Larry walks back a few steps and rushes on the door, trying to

          break it open.

                          CAROL

           Careful, now.

                          LARRY

           Don't worry. Just-Just give me a second.

          He does it another time.

                          CAROL

           Don't hurt yourself.

                          LARRY

           Must be one of those new doors.

                          CAROL

           Let's try out here.

          Carol points to another room opening in the one they are in.

          Carol and Larry are now walking in a lit corridor.

                          LARRY

           Oh, my god. I keep hearing noises.

                          CAROL

           Oh. What's down there ?

          Carol walks rapidly toward a dark section of the corridor. The

          camera follows her.

                          LARRY

           Where ? Where you... Where are you going ? Don't leave me.

                          CAROL

           Let me see. It's okay. What ? Oh !

          She has reached a door with a barred window showing the street

          outside.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. I think this is it. I think this is the service

           entrance.

          She tries to open the door, but it is a bit stuck.

                          LARRY

           Well, come on.

                          CAROL

           I'm trying.

                          LARRY

           Come on, get it open.

          Carol succeeds in opening the door.

                          CAROL

           I got it. I got it.

                          LARRY

           Go into a trot.

          They rush outside.

          NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Long shot on the dark street. At a distance, we see a man putting

          a large oblong-shaped parcel in the trunk of a car. The man looks

          very much like Paul.

          The camera pans around to give us a reverse-angle medium shot of

          Carol and Larry coming out of the basement of the hotel. They

          stopped in the middle of the short staircase.

                          CAROL

           Wait ! Wait ! Did you see that ?

                          LARRY

           What ?

                          CAROL

           It looks like somebody's putting a body into a car.

                          LARRY

           Jesus.

                          CAROL

           I swear. Look. It's got a white sheet on it.

                          LARRY

           Yes.

                          CAROL

           Right... Yeah. Come on.

          Carol walks on to the sidewalk, followed by a very frightened

          Larry.

                          LARRY

           It is. Oh, brother.

          The camera pans back around to give us a reverse-angle shot of the

          car leaving the curb of the street.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Let's-Let's-Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Oh, my God. Wait. No, look ! Let's-Let's follow him. Come

           on.

           LARRY (voice over)

           No, no, no, no.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Yeah, no. Come on.

          The camera pans back around again to give a reverse-angle medium

          long shot of Carol and Larry running toward their car.

                          LARRY

           I'm not going to follow. I'm not gonna... I don't wanna

           follow him.

                          CAROL

           No, let's follow it. I swear, there was a body in that car.

                          LARRY

           I know, I saw that there was a...

                          CAROL

           Larry !

                          LARRY

           I don't wanna follow a car with a body in it.

                          CAROL

           Come on, hurry up. Hurry up !

                          LARRY

           It's-It's probably-It's probably a rented car.

          They have reached their car and they start climbing into it, Larry

          still on the driver's side.

                          CAROL

           There ! Oh !

                          LARRY

           And a rented body.

                          CAROL

           Hurry up. Come on.

          They slam the doors, switch the headlights on and start.

          NEW-YORK - AERIAL OVERVIEW OF BROOKLYN BRIDGE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          The camera starts with the interchange at one end of the bridge,

          then pans to the bridge itself. At this early hour of the night,

          the bridge still has a lot of traffic moving on it. Then the

          camera moves down to get a closer look of the traffic on the

          bridge.

           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

           Oh, Jesus. I-I can't c... I can't follow his car.

          The camera follows the moving traffic on the bridge, and certainly

          also follows Larry's car, even though, from this height, we can't

          tell which car it is.

           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

           Well, he's right up ahead. He's right there.

           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

           Where, up ahead ? I don't know which car I'm following

           here. I... You know, I'm not a good driver. I can't chase

           somebody in a car. I'm gonna have an accident. I'm, you

           know, I'll-I'll-I'll wind up hitting a school bus or

           something.

           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

           Look, it's nighttime. There's no school buses at night-

           time.

           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

           Don't tell me that. What about night school ?

          LARRY'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Long shot of the road taken from inside Larry's car. They pass the

          15W exit.

          NEW-YORK - INDUSTRIAL PARK - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Long shot inside an industrial park, somewhere on the outskirts of

          New-York. Larry's car drives slowly inside the park, coming toward

          us. There is no one else at this time of the night. The place is

          lit by a few lampposts, and there is smoke behind Larry's car.

           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

           You have no sense of direction. I was...

           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

           Well, not exactly. Twenty-twenty vision.

           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

           You have no sense of direction.

           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

           Not exactly. But anyway... No, I do have a sense of

           direction. He came right here.

           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

           Where the hell are we ? What is this ?

           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

           I-I don't know why here.

           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

           I don't know, but...

           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

           There it is !

           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

           What ?

           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

           There's his car. Right there.

           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

           How do you know it's his car ?

           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

           That's his car.

           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

           Oh, it is his car.

           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

           It is his.

           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

           Yes. Yes. Yes.

           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)

           Well, of course.

          The car stops.

           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

           Okay, let me turn the light off.

          The car headlights switch off.

           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

           Be careful, be careful, be careful.

          They both get out of the car, and they start walking toward the

          place where Carol saw the other car.

          They reach the other car surrounded by huge piles of metal scrap.

          The car and the scenery around it are lit by a powerful red light.

          Carol and Larry run toward the place where the red light comes

          from. It is inside a huge building. But they don't go inside the

          building and, instead, keep on running along the building.

          Medium shot on Larry and Carol. Carol stops Larry and points at

          something.

                          CAROL

           Look, look !

          The camera pans to the thing Carol was pointing at. A body, half-

          wrapped in a white sheet, is being lifted by a huge electromagnet.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Oh, my God ! It's Mrs. House's body !

          Reverse high-angle shot on Larry and Carol, as if they were seen

          from the magnet.

                          LARRY

           Come on ! We gotta stop it before it gets dropped.

          Larry takes Carol's hand and runs toward the magnet.

          Reverse angle long shot on a group of workers in the background.

          Then the camera pans to a reverse angle medium shot on Larry and

          Carol coming out between rows of huge heavy-duty bags.

          Reverse angle medium shot on a huge cauldron full of hot melted

          metal. A huge pair of metal jaws is dropping metal scraps into the

          cauldron. Among the metal scraps, we see Mrs. House's body

                          CAROL

           Oh, my God.

          The camera zooms to a close shot on the cauldron.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Good bye, Mrs. House.

          Reverse angle shot on Larry and Carol. Then reverse angle long

          shot on the cauldron. A lot of bright sparks are coming out of the

          cauldron.

          Long shot on the building. Larry and Carol are coming out of the

          building. They start running toward the camera. The camera pans

          around to a medium shot on Paul's car. Through the windshield, we

          see Paul behind the wheel, lit by the red light coming from the

          melted metal. He starts the car and drives away.

          The camera pans around toward Carol and Larry, still running - too

          late - toward Paul's car.

                          LARRY

           That was Mr. House ! That was definitely Mr. House.

                          CAROL

           What are we gonna do ?

          They run after the departing car.

          NEW-YORK - LARRY'S RESIDENCE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT

          Full shot of Larry's car. He has just parked it, and Carol and he

          are coming out of it.

                          LARRY

           I'm gonna call the Police, now.

                          CAROL

           Oh, Larry, and tell them what ?

                          LARRY

           And get them...

                          CAROL

           I mean, this guy...

                          LARRY

           What are we...

          Larry has walked around the car and joins Carol on the sidewalk.

                          CAROL

           You know, he's got proof his wife died of a heart attack

           two weeks ago. We've got no body. We've got nothing, Larry.

          Larry looks away from her and puts his hand on his mouth, as if

          frightened by something

                          LARRY

           Ohhh !...

                          CAROL

           What ? What ? What's wrong ? What? Oh !...

          The camera turns around Larry and Carol and, located now behind

          Larry's back, gives us a full shot of the entrance of Larry's

          building.

                          CAROL

           Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

          Paul and Gladys Dalton, Paul's assistant at his movie house, are

          coming out of the building. Paul tuns his head around and sees

          Carol and Larry.

                          PAUL

           Hallo, there.

                          CAROL

           Hey.

                          PAUL

           How are you ?

                          CAROL

           H-How are you ?

                          PAUL

           May I introduce Gladys Dalton, my gal Friday ?

                          CAROL

           Mrs. D... How are you ? Nice to see you.

          Carol and Larry shake hands with Gladys.

                          PAUL

           This is Larry and Carol, my neighbors.

                          CAROL

           Yes.

                          GLADYS

           Nice to see you.

                          PAUL

           We were just watching Madame Bovary. Wonderful.

                          GLADYS

           Such a sad story.

                          CAROL

           Yeah, it is. We, you know...

                          LARRY

           She-She-She gets cremated. She gets killed at the end.

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

                          PAUL

           Yeah. Listen you gotta stop up for a drink before I go on

           my trip.

                          CAROL

           Love to.

                          PAUL

           See you later.

                          CAROL

           See you later.

                          PAUL

           Oh, incidentally, if you hear of anybody who needs an

           apartment, I think I may be moving.

                          CAROL

           Oh, well, it...

                          PAUL

           See you later. Come on, Gladys.

          He puts his hand on Gladys' shoulder and start walking away with

          her.

                          CAROL

           What a shame.

                          PAUL

           Good night.

                          CAROL

           Good night.

          The camera follows the departing couple, Gladys still walking with

          the help of a cane.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium shot of Larry and Carol, sitting in their bed. They've

          already put on their nightclothes and they have a last talk before

          going to sleep.

                          LARRY

           Oh, Jesus. What a day, huh ? I can't figure it out. It's

           got to be that either he's a...

                          CAROL

           What ?

                          LARRY

           Either she's a twin, or he's a twin.

                          CAROL

           He... He...

                          LARRY

           Or they're multiple personalities, or you're a twin or I'm

           a twin.

          Carol laughs.

                          LARRY

           Because I don't know what's going on.

                          CAROL

           You're nuts.

                          LARRY

           You know, look.

                          CAROL

           Wait, wait, yeah.

                          LARRY

           Let me be logical about this.

                          CAROL

           Okay, she's not a twin. We know she's not a twin.

                          LARRY

           Hey.

                          CAROL

           What are you talking about, Larry ?

                          LARRY

           Stay calm. I want to try and puzzle this out.

                          CAROL

           I'm calm, Larry. Okay, but okay, she's a twin, she's not a

           twin. I mean, now you're saying we are twins ? What are

           you, nuts? Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm, okay.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, I'm going to be logical.

                          CAROL

           All right, all right.

                          LARRY

           The, um, the first thing is this.

                         FLASHBACK SCENE

          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT

          The door of the elevator opens. Inside the cabin, Larry and Carol

          are smiling and talking.

           LARRY (voice over)

           We came home that night. There had been a heart attack.

          Some neighbors are gathered around Paul's apartment door. Larry

          asks them questions.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Uh, what if they induced it ? You know, some kind of

           poison. We never saw the body.

          The camera pans inside Paul's corridor, where Mrs. House's body,

          completely covered by a white sheet, is lying dead on a stretcher

          with the doctor and the emergency medical team around her.

           LARRY (voice over)

           You know, it had to be some other woman. You know, some-

           some woman who probably had some kind of ballpark

           resemblance to Mrs. House.

          The camera pans around to the group of neighbors standing in the

          hallway.

           LARRY (voice over)

           The super says he saw her, but, uh, he's a drunk, you know.

           Mrs. House could have been hiding.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Back to Larry and Carol sitting in their bed.

                          LARRY

           But you-you remember that you heard a noise that night.

           That had to be Mrs. House leaving to check into the hotel.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. Yeah. Well...

                          LARRY

           I can't sleep. I just, I...

                          CAROL

           No, wait a minute, wait.

                          LARRY

           I'm too, you know... I'm too...

                          CAROL

           But it doesn't make any sense at all, Larry, because

           suddenly, you know, he murders her. I mean, what's it all

           about ?

                          LARRY

           Let me, let me call Vincent's restaurant in New Jersey...

           and why don't we go meet Ted and Marcia and get something

           to eat, and talk with them.

                          CAROL

           Wait a minute. At one in the morning ? What are you talking

           about ? You mean... You wanna...

                          LARRY

           Yeah, so what ? So what ? It's so, you know, Ted-Ted was

           taking her to a show and to-to-to dinner... so they'll be

           there.

                          CAROL

           All the way out to New Jersey...

                          LARRY

           So, hey, kid, this is the apple. This is the town that

           never sleeps. That's why we don't live in Duluth. That,

           plus I don't know where Duluth is.

          He picks up the phone on his night table.

                          LARRY

           Lucky me.

          VINCENT'S RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Vincent's is a nice cosy place, with dim lights, tasteful

          decorations, and light piano music.

          Full shot of a table with the four customer seen in profile. Larry

          is seated next to Marcia, and across from his wife. Ted is seated

          next to Carol. During the following conversation, the camera moves

          around the table.

                          TED

           Uh, you really saw his face ?

                          CAROL

           Yes. Oh, yes, I'm here to tell you...

                          TED

           You saw, you saw what he looked like ? No question. You

           know exactly who it is.

                          LARRY

           Oh, no question about it. It was-It was Mr. House. There

           was no... Not a, not a question. I mean, you could see him

           because, uh, you know, there was-there was just no way that

           you could avoid it. He was right there.

          The camera stops on Marcia and thus stops moving around the table.

                          MARCIA

           To me, it's obvious.

                          LARRY

           Wh... How do you see it ?

                          TED

           How obvious ? What do you mean ?

                          MARCIA

           Obvious he's committed the perfect murder.

                          LARRY

           What do you mean ?

                          TED

           What ? How ? What do you mean ?

                          MARCIA

           Okay, look. You have to start off with another woman who

           bears some ballpark resemblance to Mrs. House.

                          TED

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           That's what I said. That's exac... I used the term

           ballpark resemblance myself.

                          CAROL

           I know. You used the term, right.

                          LARRY

           It was my idea. I said what she said.

                          MARCIA

           They're with this woman.

                          TED

           Yeah.

                         FLASHBACK SCENE

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Paul and another woman, that looks like his wife, are seated

          around a table, having dinner. Lilian House gives a glass of wine

          to the woman, then another one to Paul, and kisses him on the

          forehead.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           Maybe having dinner. They don't induce a heart attack,

           because that's fiction bullshit.

          Later. The woman has a hard attack. Paul helps her to walk to the

          sofa.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           She has a heart attack. She drops dead spontaneously.

           They had no thought of killing her. Maybe they wished she

           was dead.

           TED (voice over)

           Why ?

           MARCIA (voice over)

           I don't know. Maybe they stood to gain if she died. They

           see a golden opportunity.

          Later. Lilian, wearing a pink night-robe, is dressing the dead

          woman, lying on the sofa, into her own clothes.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           Mrs. House dresses her up in her clothes. She hides.

           LARRY (voice over)

           This is my theory. Exactly my theory.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           That's right. She checks into a hotel.

          VINCENT'S RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Back to the restaurant. Long shot on the table. All the other

          tables are empty. The camera zooms to a full shot of the table,

          Marcia and Larry facing us, and Carol and Ted with their back to

          us.

                          CAROL

           Yeah, well, we got that far, with the exception of the

           actual spontaneous heart attack.

                          MARCIA

           Okay, you know the husband's planning to go to Paris with

           this pretty young woman.

                          TED

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           Yeah.

                          MARCIA

           He's cheating on his wife.

                          TED

           Yeah.

                          MARCIA

           So, instead of finishing the scheme they planned, he

           double-crosses her and kills her, taking her share of the

           profits.

                          TED

           Well, you think, you think Helen Moss is in on this, too,

           huh ?

                          MARCIA

           Yeah, a good chance she's aware.

                          CAROL

           Okay, but what about Mrs. Dalton ? He claims he took her to

           the movies.

                          MARCIA

           She's his alibi. She covered for him when he strangled his

           wife. She said he was at work all day.

                          LARRY

           That's right, because he introduced her as a colleague.

          Marcia lights a cigarette.

                          TED

           Wait, why... Why would she...

                          MARCIA

           She's a colleague who maybe loves him.

                          TED

           Oh, wait, wait. He's cheating on her, too.

                          LARRY

           Cheating on two women ?

                          TED

           Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's perfect. Just, it all fits.

                          LARRY

           The guy doesn't look the part.

                          MARCIA

           The point is, he's gotten away with the perfect murder.

           There are no bodies around to prove anything. And all the

           paperwork is strictly above board. He's home free.

                          TED

           Oh, my... Oh, where did you find this woman ? She's a

           genius.

                          LARRY

           She's brilliant. She's brilliant. But the guy... He knows

           that we know, so if he knows we're on him.

                          MARCIA

           Well, he doesn't care. Why should he ? Everything's been

           neatly disposed of. He's home free. Only he, and maybe his

           mistress, know the truth.

                          CAROL

           Well, j...

                          LARRY

           She's right, there's no body.

                          CAROL

           Hold on, hold on, for a second. We don't know this is all

           true. This is just a theory.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, but it's a great theory. Have you been paying

           attention ? This is a great theory.

                          TED

           Oh, yeah. It sounds good, it holds water. Everything fits

           together in this.

                          CAROL

           I am paying attention.

                          LARRY

           I think it's great.

                          MARCIA

           When I come back from the ladies room, I'll tell you how to

           trap him.

          She stands up and starts walking away to the toilets. Larry and

          Ted stand up too. They wait for her to be gone to sit back.

                          LARRY

           Oh, excuse me.

                          TED

           Where-Where did you find her ? She's-She's-She's really

           something.

                          LARRY

           Her mind, it just goes.

                          TED

           Yeah, she's got one idea after another. It's like one thing

           leads to another.

                          LARRY

           Fantastic.

          Close shot on Carol.

                          CAROL

           I'm surprised you two didn't drool yourself to death.

          The camera zooms back to a medium shot on Carol and Ted.

                          TED

           Oh, I thought we just had a nice first date. That's...

           LARRY (voice over)

           I knew that they would hit it off.

                          CAROL

           Why? Uh-huh. Yeah. Him.

           LARRY (voice over)

           I-I-I knew this.

                          CAROL

           Yeah, uh-huh. What about you ? You were gonna jump into her

           lap. I saw you, Larry.

          The camera moves around the table to a medium shot on Larry, with

          Ted and Carol's backs in the foreground.

                          LARRY

           What are you talking about ?

                          CAROL

           Huh ?

                          LARRY

           I'm, I'm, huh, what's wrong with you ? I'm her editor. I'm-

           I'm a father figure to her, how...

                          CAROL

           Yeah, the only thing you didn't do is rub your hands

           together. That was it.

                          LARRY

           You gotta be joking. What... are you telling me that you're

           jealous of Marcia ?

                          CAROL

           I... Well. It's not that I'm jealous.

                          TED

           Kids, kids. People, what are we doing, here?

          The camera pans to a medium close shot on Carol.

                          CAROL

           Yeah, look who's talking. My God, I mean, you kept staring

           into her eyes like she was the Dragon Lady, or something.

          The camera slightly zooms back to show us Larry and Carol

                          LARRY

           What'd wrong with you ? You're jealous because he's-he's

           interested in her.

                          TED

           I'm interested in her theory. What... I don't... What are

           you...

                          CAROL

           Well, I'd just like to know if you take all your-your

           authors to lunch at the Cafe des...

          Marcia walks back to the table.

                          MARCIA

           Okay, I've got it.

          She sits down, while Larry half-stands up and then sits back.

          Close shot on Marcia

                          MARCIA

           Here's the story. Since he's gotten away with it, all we

           can do is bluff. As long as we have no body, we have no

           case.

          The camera pans to Ted.

                          TED

           What... What do you mean ? What do we... We pretend that he

           slipped up, and the molten steel didn't do the job ? What-

           What do you mean ?

          The camera pans back to Marcia.

                          MARCIA

           Yeah, it's possible. He saw you there, he knows you're onto

           him. After he ran away, why couldn't you have retrieved the

           body ?

                          LARRY

           You're kidding. I... We couldn't have gotten her out of

           that. We... I would have wound up with a few toes and a

           shoulder, maybe, at most.

                          MARCIA

           Well, that's... Okay, okay, you have the body. What does he

           know ? He was probably too scared to be very lucid.

          The camera pans to Ted, who looks at Marcia with worshipping eyes.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           He's an amateur. He dumped the body and ran off, and then

           somehow - who knows the details, you two dug her out. Now,

           you can send him to the chair.

                          CAROL

           Okay, okay, just...

                          TED

           I like this woman, she's lurid.

                          CAROL

           Let me tell you why he's not going to believe us, okay ?

          The camera pans on Larry.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, first of all, because I can't, I can't bluff or lie

           without giggling, so-so...

          The camera pans to Carol.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. No, because if we really had the body, why tell him ?

           Why not go straight to the Police ?

          The camera pans to Marcia.

                          MARCIA

           If you tell the cops, you can't shake him down.

          Medium shot on another table, around which two middle-aged men are

          seated, listening very eagerly to the conversation.

           TED (voice over)

           Oh, she's wicked. Oh, I-look... look how, look how this

           works out. You go to the law, what do you gain ?

          Medium close shot on Ted and Carol.

                          TED

           I mean, so-so maybe they, you know, they put him in jail.

           What have you got ? You haven't got anything.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Right.

                          TED

           But if he wants the evidence, and he's got to pay for it,

           now... Okay, now he's nervous, right ?

                          CAROL

           Yeah, you know, wait. There's just so many fallacies in

           this, I can't even count them.

          The camera pans to Marcia and Larry.

           TED (voice over)

           What ? Name one.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Name one? Okay, the guy looks us straight in the eyes and

           says, What body? What the hell are you talking about ?

           Prove it.

                          MARCIA

           Well, that's when we keep bluffing.

           TED (voice over)

           What ? How ? What do we do ?

                          MARCIA

           We produce the body.

                          LARRY

           Yeah, but where are you gonna get it. Madame Tussaud's ?

                          MARCIA

           Yeah. Say-Say we found someone to corroborate this story.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Oh, really. J-Just...

                          MARCIA

           Someone he trusted.

          The camera pans to Ted and Carol.

                          CAROL

           Like who ?

           MARCIA (voice over)

           Like his lover. Say she called and said, Paul, I've just

           seen Lillian's body. They want a hundred thousand dollars

           for it.

                          TED

           Why-Why would she do that ?

          The camera pans to Marcia and Larry.

           MARCIA (to Larry)

           Remember that book you recommended to me ? Murder in

           Manhattan ?

                          LARRY

           Oh, yes. Max Schindler's book. That's right, the phone

           call.

           CAROL (voice over)

           I don't remember that book.

                          LARRY

           This is perfect.

           CAROL (voice over)

           You never mentioned that book to me.

                          LARRY

           No, no. Because you don't like light reading, so I never...

          The camera pans to Ted and Carol.

                          CAROL

           Since when did I not like light reading, Larry ?

                          TED

           I don't know... I don't know this book. What is this book ?

          The camera pans to Larry and Marcia.

                          LARRY

           This book. That's fantastic ! It would be so perfect

           because s-she's a, she's a-an, actress, or would-be

           actress, anyhow, and you're-you-re... Jeez, we could use

           his theatre. He's a playwright. This is so perfect. Your

           theatre is empty all the time, anyhow.

          The camera pans to Carol and Ted.

                          CAROL

           Oh, God.

                          TED

           Oh, yeah, thank you. That's great. What-What are we talking

           about here ? What-What do you mean ? What-What is this ?

          The camera pans to Larry and Marcia.

                          LARRY

           Listen to this. What you do is, we get her in for a fake

           audition, and you write some lines that don't mean

           anything.

           TED (voice over)

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           And she does them, and she doesn't know what she's doing

           and we tape-record it.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Uh...

                          LARRY

           Listen to this.

           CAROL (voice over)

           I'm listening.

                          LARRY

           And we edit it up. We edit the tape recording up, and we

           make one end of a phone call...

          The camera pans to Ted and Carol.

           LARRY (voice over)

           ...and we play it into the phone to Mr. House.

                          TED

           This is in the book ?

          The camera pans to Larry and Marcia.

                          LARRY

           This is perfect, list...

           CAROL (voice over)

           Oh, come on. No, that could never, ever work, in a million

           years. You don't know what he's going to say.

          The camera pans to Ted and Carol.

                          CAROL

           What's he gonna say ?

          The camera pans to Marcia and Larry.

                          MARCIA

           In the book, they use several tape recorders.

           CAROL (voice over)

           In the book ?

                          MARCIA

           We coordinate it.

                          LARRY

           It's coordinated.

          The camera pans to Ted and Carol.

                          CAROL

           In the book. You mean, you're basing your plan on some dumb

           paperback ?

           LARRY (voice over)

           This is great. This is great.

                          CAROL

           I s... No, really.

           LARRY (voice over)

           I like... No, it's great.

                          CAROL

           Oh.

          The camera pans to Marcia and Larry.

                          MARCIA

           He's gotten away with murder. Our only chance is to nab him

           as he tries to kill again, cover his tracks.

          Medium shot on the two waiters, standing on either side of the

          counter, and listening to the conversation.

           LARRY (voice over)

           It's great. What happens, is... it provokes him to kill

           again. They catch him the second time.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           Exactly. He's gotten away with the first murder.

          Medium close shot on Carol and Ted.

           LARRY (voice over)

           You know what I'm thinking, though ?

          The camera pans to Marcia and Larry.

                          MARCIA

           What ?

                          LARRY

           Actually, in the book what happens is, now that I think of

           it, he... he kills the... the two people that are working

           the scheme on him.

           TED (voice over)

           Yeah, that's all right.

           CAROL (voice over)

           But...

           TED (voice over)

           But you're not worried about that.

                          LARRY

           Um, well, I don't know.

                          MARCIA

           It's perfect.

                          LARRY

           Either that, or I've... I've just developed Parkinson's.

          The camera zooms back, to show us the four people around the

          table.

                          TED

           No, we can handle him. We can handle him. Listen, this is

           incredible. This is an incredible idea.

                          MARCIA

           It's perfect. It's perfect. He knows you're onto him. You

           shake him down.

                          CAROL

           No, no.

                          MARCIA

           He comes after you, we nab him.

          The camera stops zooming back and gives us a full shot on the

          table.

                          TED

           That's great. It's great. You're wonderful. I just... I'm

           amazed.

                          MARCIA

           Yeah.

                          CAROL

           I... I just...

                          MARCIA

           It's either that, or he walks.

                          CAROL

           Yeah. Yeah, wait. I... So, what you're saying is...

                          TED

           This is great.

                          CAROL

           Wait, no, okay... What you're saying... Oh boy. You're

           saying, you want to provoke Mr. House into trying to murder

           Larry and me.

                          MARCIA

           Yeah. It's perfect. You're not scared, are you ?

                          LARRY

           No, no, no, no, no, I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm

           just turning it over in my mind. I just want to check with

           my clergyman before we commit.

          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot on Helen Moss, making a phone call from an open booth

          in the street. While she is talking, the camera comes closer to

          her, to a medium close shot on her face.

                          HELEN

           Hi, uh, B-twenty-four messages ? Oh, really ? Audition for

           what ? Did he say ? Okay, okay. Wait, hold on.

          She looks into her purse and gets her agenda out of it.

                          HELEN

           Let me get a pencil. Okay.

          TED'S THEATRE - STAGE - INTERIOR DAY

          Full slightly high-angled shot on the stage. In the middle of the

          stage floor, a white circle, on which there is a chair and a small

          table with a telephone. Suzanne Raphael, a young woman, is

          auditioning. She is seated on the chair, holding the telephone.

          Behind Suzanne, which is the left side of the stage seen from the

          audience, a white wall, with a doorless opening. On either side of

          the wall, two red columns. And on either side of the girl, which

          are the front and the back of the stage, two red metallic frames.

          In front of the girl, a video camera on a tripod, with an operator

          standing behind the camera. Actually, the operator is Sy, Larry

          and Carol's friend, whom we have seen much earlier in the film, in

          the antique market and at Elaine's restaurant. The stage is well

          lit, when the audience hall is in the dark.

                          SUZANNE

           Yeah, well, Dad, you know, I've heard just about enough of

           this.

          She slams the phone down. The camera pans around to show us the

          right side of the stage, where there is several rows of theatre

          seats and a table in front of the seats. Ted, Marcia and Marilyn

          are seated in the front row. Marilyn is Sy's wife, whom we have

          also seen earlier in the film. Carol is seated in the second row,

          behind Marcia.

                          TED

           Good, that's great. Thank you, Suzanne. Thank you.

                          MARCIA

           We'll let you know. That's Suzanne Raphael, right ?

                          TED

           Yeah. Good, thank you.

          Carol taps on Marilyn's shoulder, and whispers something to her.

          Ted joins them in their whispered conversation. The camera pans

          back on the stage. Larry, with a clipboard in his hand, has

          entered the stage, pushing Helen in front of him.

                          LARRY

           This is Helen Moss.

                          HELEN

           Hi, there.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Hi, there.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           Hi.

                          HELEN

           Hi.

          Medium close shot on Ted, who stands up, and walks toward the

          stage. The camera follows him.

                          TED

           Uh, have you, uh... I know, I know you just got the

           material, uh, you know, just in the... last little while,

           but... uh, h-have you had a chance to-to study it ? To go

           over it, a little bit ?

          The camera pans to a medium close shot of Helen.

                          HELEN

           Yes, yes. Uh, I have, but, um, I have just a few questions.

                          TED

           Sure , yeah.

          The camera moves slightly, and is now located behind Ted's back,

          still with Helen in medium close shot.

                          HELEN

           Is she divorced, in this ?

                          TED

           Uh, yes. Yes.

                          HELEN

           Uh, recently ?

                          TED

           Yes. Yeah. But she's, uh, very, highly emotional.

                          HELEN

           Yeah.

                          TED

           You know really... uh, lot of... Lot of feeling. Very

           strong.

                          HELEN

           Oh.

                          TED

           Hm ?

                          HELEN

           Should I just begin ?

                          TED

           Yeah, just... Whenever, you know, whenever you feel it.

           Whenever you feel into it.

          Ted walks away. Helen takes a very deep breathing, sits down, puts

          her hands trough her hair, takes another breathing, and picks up

          the phone handset from the telephone on the table. She overdoes it

          a lot, trying to act as the prima dona she is not.

                          HELEN

           Yeah, okay.

          She dials a fake number on the phone keyboard.

                          HELEN

           Hello, Joe ? I-I was just... I...

           TED (voice over)

           Uh, let me stop you right there.

          Helen looks in Ted's direction.

           TED (voice over)

           I'm sorry, I... uh, if you'll be... if you'll start out

           more frightened... then that'll take you where you're gonna

           go.

                          HELEN

           Right, right.

          She breathes deeply before starting again.

                          HELEN

           Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much, now, and if I sound

           strange, don't get alarmed.

          Later. Helen is auditioning another scene. She doesn't have the

          phone in her hand any more. She is holding a script and looking at

          it. Larry is seated in front of her, and read his own script on

          his clipboard.

                          HELEN

           Give me your hand. Hold on. Try not to fall. Hold on.

                          LARRY

           I'm trying, I'm trying.

                          HELEN

           Quickly ! Hurry !

          Later. Close shot of Helen's face auditioning another scene.

                          HELEN

           They're asking two hundred thousand dollars for it. Yeah.

           They say it's Monet, but I say it's a fake.

          Medium shot of Helen, seen from behind. We see Sy standing behind

          his camera on her right, and Larry standing with his clipboard in

          his hand on her left. In the background, Ted, Marcia, Marilyn and

          Carol listening to her. While Helen is talking, the camera moves

          backward through the opening in the scenery.

                          HELEN

           Ever since Joe came home from Vietnam, he's cast a pall on

           everything. A dark cloud, a pall.

          A BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT.

          Full shot on the upper level of a building, that could be either

          Ted's theatre of Sy's workshop. The camera tilts down to street

          level.

          SY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT

          We are inside Sy's workshop. It is full of very high-tech video

          and audio equipment.

          Medium shot of Marilyn standing behind a computer. Close to her,

          Carol is seated on a table, and Ted is standing next to her. They

          are both looking at a large video monitor. On the monitor screen

          and on the computer screen, we see the same picture of Helen

          auditioning with the telephone in her hand.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much, right now...

          The camera pans to Marcia, seated behind Carol and also looking at

          the monitor. Behind her, Sy is looking at another monitor, and

          manipulating some switches on an editing machine underneath the

          monitor. Larry is standing next to him.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           ... and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.

          Sy rewinds the video tape.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much right now.

          Sy fast winds the tape.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           Hello, Joe ? Ever since Joe came back from Vietnam...

          Close shot on Ted's face, then the camera pans to Carol and

          Marcia, seated one behind the other, and behind them, Sy working

          on the editing machine, with Larry standing next to him. The

          camera zooms on Sy.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           ... he's cast a pall on everything. A dark cloud, a pall.

          Sy rewinds the tape.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           A pall.

          Sy rewinds the tape.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           Pall.

          Sy rewinds the tape.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           Pall.

          Slightly later. Medium close shot of Ted looking at something we

          don't see, with Marcia standing next to him.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           Hello, Joe ?

          The camera pans to Carol standing up and looking at the same thing

          as Ted. We hear Helen's voice distorted by Sy's editing machine.

           HELEN'S VOICE (distorted)

           Hello, Joe.

          The camera pans back on Ted and Marcia, then it pans to a close

          shot of a big high-tech tape recorder, on which Sy is working. We

          see his hands cutting off a short section of the audio tape, and

          gluing back the two severed ends of the tape together.

          Full shot of the room. In the foreground, Sy is working on his

          tape recorder. On his right, Larry is standing and looking at him.

          On his left, Marilyn also looking at him. Behind him, Carol, Ted

          and Marcia, all looking at him.

                          TED

           It's so...

          The camera zooms on Ted and Marcia.

          Close up shot on the tape recorder. Sy starts it.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           Hello, Paul ? I can't talk much, right now...

          The camera tilts up from the tape recorder to a medium shot on Ted

          and Marcia. Ted smiles when he hears the work Sy has done with the

          tape.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           ... and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.

                          MARCIA (SMILING)

           Perfect.

          She shakes hands with Larry.

                          TED

           That's great.

          He also shake hands with Larry, moving slightly Carol out of the

          way.

                          MARCIA

           You did great. Great.

          Larry suddenly notices that Carol has been excluded from the hand-

          shaking party, and he turns around toward her.

                          CAROL

           Well, yeah, it's, excuse me, hey, don't worry, yeah, okay.

                          MARCIA

           Fantastic.

          MARCIA'S CAR - INTERIOR DAY

          The camera is behind Marcia, who is driving in a street in New-

          York. We see Helen walking on the sidewalk.

                          MARCIA

           There she is.

          The camera pans around, from inside the car, to get a better shot

          of Helen.

                          TED

           Where ?

                          MARCIA

           You have to keep her busy for all afternoon.

          Through the back window of the car, we see Helen entering a

          restaurant called Time.

                          TED

           Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I'll-I'll just keep

           improvising, you know ?

                          MARCIA

           Okay, well, it shouldn't be too hard. She's a hungry

           actress, you're a playwright with a role.

          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Close shot on Marcia's car, inside which Marcia and Ted are

          talking together.

                          TED

           You know what ? I'll g... I'll talk about the play, or, get

           her, get her talking about the part, you know, her life.

           I'll get her talking about her life, and her whole

           background. Stop the car, I'm gonna get out here.

                          MARCIA

           Good. We'll hook up later, okay ?

                          TED

           All right. Good - Good luck with your assignment. Ok ?

                          MARCIA

           All right, you too.

          Marcia has stopped the car, and Ted is getting out of it.

          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Full shot of a large room, furnished with good taste. In the

          background a large bay window, overlooking some green trees. On

          the right, there is a large modern mantlepiece. On the left, a

          bicycle is leaning on the wall. Under the window, a large and cosy

          sofa.

          Carol and Sy are standing in front of the window and talking

          together. Next to them and Marcia is also standing and reading a

          large album. In the foreground, Larry, who is the only one not to

          be casually dressed, and is wearing jacket and necktie, is playing

          with a small cassette-player in his hands. Marilyn is walking into

          the room.

                          MARILYN

           Listen, does anybody want some guacamole or anything ?

          Sy walks toward her, holding another cassette player. Carol is

          also holding one.

                          SY

           Would you stop with the guacamole ? We have to get started

           with this.

          He looks at his watch.

                          LARRY

           He should be back for lunch, right ?

                          SY

           Come on, let's go.

                          MARILYN

           Yeah. All right, let's go.

                          LARRY

           So, everybody's got the right tape recorder and the right

           tape in ?

                          SY

           Yes, we do.

          They all sit down around a low table.

                          MARCIA

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           All right, one second. And then we ca... I mea... so, uh,

           we're on speaker.

                          CAROL

           This is so insane.

                          LARRY

           Now wait, wait, wait. There's, um... I'm not nervous.

                          CAROL

           Oh, w...

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY

          The backstage is in the same disorder as before, with all the

          mirrors scattered around. Full shot of Paul and Gladys standing in

          the middle of the room

                          PAUL

           I have the contractor come in and nobody's here ? Now you

           see if you can find...

          The phone rings.

                          PAUL

           I'll get that. Uh, you go and call him.

          Paul walks out of the room.

                          GLADYS

           Oh. Yes, yes, all right.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Paul walks into a small room in a corner of the backstage. It must

          have been a dressing room, but now it is full of various junk,

          with a big poster, that looks like a enlarged newspaper, on the

          wall. Paul picks up the phone from a small counter fixed on the

          wall.

                          PAUL

           Hallo ?

          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Full shot of the little group around the low table. Marcia and

          Larry are seated next to each other in front of the camera, Sy is

          seated on Larry's left and his wife on Marcia's right. Carol is

          seated on the other side of the table, with her back to the

          camera.

          Marcia, who is seated next to the telephone, presses the play

          button on her cassette player. Helen's voice comes out of it.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           Hello, Paul. I can't talk much right now. And if I sound

           strange, don't get alarmed.

          Marcia presses the stop button.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium close shot of Paul on the phone.

                          PAUL

           What's the problem ?

          He sits down.

          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Marcia presses the play button.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           They have your wife's body. They showed it to me.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          PAUL

           Say that again.

          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Carol is shaking her head, not paying much attention to what is

          going on. Marilyn and Marcia both silently point to Carol's

          cassette player, to tell her it is her turn to play it. Carol

          picks up her player to put it in front of the telephone and

          presses the play button.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           They have your wife's body. They showed it to me.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          PAUL

           Exactly who has it ? How many are there ?

          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          It is Sy's turn to switch his player on.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           Your neighbors. That's right. They want two hundred

           thousand dollars for it.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          PAUL

           Where are you calling from ? There's an echo. Are you on a

           speaker phone ?

          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          The group seems surprised by a question they did not expected.

          Marcia silently points to Marilyn's player. Marilyn presses the

          play button.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           Hold on.

          Marcia presses on the mute button on the telephone set.

                          LARRY

           We don't have an answer for that. What are we gonna do ?

                          MARCIA

           Go to a different thought.

                          CAROL

           Mm...mmm... What thought ? Wait.

          Marcia presses the mute button on the telephone. Sy turns to

          Carol.

                          SY

           Shhh !...

          Carol puts her hand in front of her mouth. Larry gets his player

          close to the telephone and presses the play button

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           You've either got to pay them off, or get rid of them.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          PAUL

           Look, we can't talk about this on the phone. Can you meet

           me ?

          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          It is still Larry's turn to use his player.

           HELEN'S VOICE (louder)

           Yes! They're keeping it refrigerated.

          Marcia hits Larry's elbow, to tell him it was the wrong cue.

           PAUL (voice over in the speaker of the telephone)

           What ? What did you say ?

          Larry is very nervous all of a sudden, and puts another player in

          front of the telephone.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           About two hours ago.

          Larry drops the player.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          PAUL

           Two... what ? Two hours what ?

          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Marcia points to Marilyn's player. Marilyn presses the play

          button.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           Hold on.

          Marcia presses the mute button on the telephone set. Larry just

          got the cassette out of his player and can't put it back in. He is

          more and more nervous.

                          LARRY

           Jesus... we're all screwed up. I got this all screwed up.

                          MARCIA

           Okay, let's get off as quick as possible. We've done it.

                          SY

           All right, well, do something. Do something.

           MARCIA (to Larry)

           Shhh !... Um, okay. Sh !...

          She presses the mute button on the telephone, then presses the

          play button on her player.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           Hello, Paul. I can't talk much right now. And if I sound

           strange, don't get alarmed.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          PAUL

           Look, Helen, you're not making any sense. I know you're

           upset, but you have to pull yourself together. Now, could

           we meet ? The usual spot.

          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           Hold on.

          Marilyn, who has just been playing her player, presses the stop

          button on it. Then Marcia presses the mute button on the

          telephone. Meanwhile, Larry has succeeded in getting a good length

          of tape out of his cassette, and tries to put it back in !

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                          PAUL

           Helen ? Helen, you still there ? Helen ?

          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Larry is still trying to put the tape back into the cassette.

                          MARCIA

           Okay, hurry up, hurry up. Okay.

                          LARRY

           Somebody press something, come on.

          Now, Larry is surrounded by a hundred feet of tape, which is

          flying all around him ! Marcia points to Carol's player.

                          CAROL

           What ?

                          LARRY

           You can't press some... Come on.

          Marcia presses the mute button on the telephone, and Carol

          presses the play button on her player.

                          HELEN'S VOICE

           You have no choice, they've got the goods. You just pay

           them off, or get rid of them. I have to hang up.

          Marcia presses the off button on the telephone.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Paul slowly puts the telephone down on its hook. He stands up and

          walks back to the backstage.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY

                          GLADYS

           What's the matter, Paul ? You look all shaken up.

                          PAUL

           No, no. It's nothing.

                          GLADYS

           I worry about you these days, Paul.

                          PAUL

           I'm fine, I'm fine.

                          GLADYS

           You're different.

                          PAUL

           I said I was fine. Will you stop interfering ?

                          GLADYS

           You never used to pull away from me.

           PAUL (getting mad)

           I told you to leave me alone ! I don't want to have this

           conversation all the time !

          He walks out and Gladys put her hands on her eyes. She slowly

          walks away with the help of her cane.

          NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE SY AND MARILYN'S HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Full shot of a nice building with short trees and wrought iron

          gates in front of it. We hear voices but we don't see anyone yet.

           LARRY (voice over)

           Great. All right. Now, my job is to wait exactly one hour

           and call Mr. House from a phone booth. Where are you...

           Where are you running so fast ?

          Carol runs out of the building.

                          CAROL

           I have to go home and change.

          Larry comes out of the building and closes the door. Carol turns

          toward him.

                          CAROL

           I've got an appointment with a friend of Ted's about a

           location for... What ?

                          LARRY

           What's the matter ? What are you so angry about ? What are

           you so... What are you so steamed up about ?

                          CAROL

           What do you mean ? Well, I meant... I just don't understand

           how you could give a book to Marcia, and not to me.

          They start walking down the street. The camera follows them.

                          LARRY

           What are you talking about ?

                          CAROL

           I just don't need...

                          LARRY

           We had just a big success in there.

                          CAROL

           What...

                          LARRY

           Marcia likes to read what I like to read.

                          CAROL

           Oh, right, God. Yeah, well it's true. I guess it's true. I

           mean, we've got nothing in common, that's for sure. Now

           that, now that Nick's grown up, I mean, you know, we're

           just left facing each other.

                          LARRY

           You got stuff in common with Ted, right ? You can cook

           together with Ted, or you can take your clothes off and

           baste a chicken with him.

                          CAROL

           Oh, right. Oh, oh, well, what about you and Marcia, huh ?

           What does she teach you besides poker ? That's what I'd

           like to know, okay ?

                          LARRY

           Mud wrestling. Is that what you want to hear ? Nothing, I'm

           her editor.

                          CAROL

           Look, I think the time has come for us to reevaluate our

           lives.

                          LARRY

           I reevaluated our lives.

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           I... I... I got a ten. You got a six.

          The camera stops moving and just shows just the departing couple

          walking down the street.

                          CAROL

           Well, listen, I think maybe I will go back to seeing my

           shrink.

                          LARRY

           Oh. You don't have to see your shrink. There's nothing

           wrong with you that can't be cured with a little Prozac and

           a polo mallet.

                          CAROL

           Just... I just would like to be alone for a while, okay,

           Larry ?

                          LARRY

           What are you talk...

                          CAROL

           Just... just, I... I... Uh, okay ?

          Long shot of Carol running away, while Larry, standing in the

          middle of the sidewalk, looks at her going away.

          A CAFETERIA - INTERIOR DAY

          A classical New-York cafeteria, with tables and chairs scattered

          all around the room. In the background the long counter, where the

          food is displayed, and along which the customer are lining up at

          lunchtime. Around a slightly isolated table on the left, Ted and

          Helen are talking.

                          HELEN

           So, I have this, like, really crazy father and everything.

                          TED

           Oh, yeah ?

          The camera zooms to a medium shot on Ted and Helen.

                          HELEN

           And, yeah. He's wanted, like, in three states. He has a

           terrible driving record. So we had to move from Virginia

           then to New Jersey, and...

                          TED

           So, your father is wanted in three states for driving ?

           Really ?

                          HELEN

           Yeah, for driving. Yeah. So I moved to Hackensack, and

           then... Well, anyway, I was in all these different contests

           and I was even, uh, Miss, uh, Teenage Passaic.

                          TED

           Oh, how wonderful.

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot of the room. The front door opens and Carol walks in.

          She slams the door shut and puts her purse on a table. She takes

          her coat off, walks into the corridor and opens a closet to put

          the coat away in it. She then chooses a new set of clothes and

          shoes to go to her appointment. She closes the closet and walks

          into the bathroom to change. She closes the bathroom door. The

          camera remains outside the bathroom and starts moving along the

          corridor back to the front door. The front door opens and Paul

          walks in. He walks silently along the corridor toward the

          bathroom.

          A CAFETERIA - INTERIOR DAY

          Same medium shot as before on Ted and Helen.

                          TED

           Was that before or after the fourth abortion ?

                          HELEN

           Well, after the fourth, but before the drama prize.

                          TED

           The drama prize ?

                          HELEN

           And... Mm... hm.

                          TED

           I don't remember the...

                          HELEN

           Remember ? Remember ?

                          TED

           What ?

                          HELEN

           Out, out, damn spot ? The topless Macbeth ?

                          TED

           Oh, yeah. Oh, for the fraternity party, yeah, yeah.

                          HELEN

           Yeah, yeah.

                          TED

           Topless Macbeth. I don't... How could I forget that ?

           It's just...

          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Larry is in an open phone booth in a quiet street. He picks up the

          handset, put a coin in the slot, and starts dialing the number he

          has written on a piece of paper.

                          LARRY

           Hallo, Mr. House ? This is Larry Lipton. I... I got a... a

           package I think you're gonna want. Of course it's gonna

           cost you, uh, $200,000 in... in small, unmarked bills.

           Or... or... or large marked ones, if... if... if you want

           to go that route.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          The small disused dressing-room in the corner of the backstage.

          Paul is talking into the telephone. In front of him, Carol is tied

          on a chair, with a white cloth gag taped on her mouth. While Paul

          is talking, the camera zooms on Carol's frightened face.

                          PAUL

           And I have a package you might want, Mr. Lipton. If you

           ever wanna see your wife alive again, you'll do as I say.

          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Larry is still in the phone booth.

                          LARRY

           Oh, really ? Well, I think you're bluffing. Yeah, don't...

           don't ever try and bluff a bluffer. Yeah, if... if you got

           Carol, put her on the phone.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Paul takes the gag off Carol's mouth and put the phone mouthpiece

          in front of her lips.

                          CAROL (CRYING)

           Larry, Larry, help me ! I'm here, Larry !

          Paul puts the gag back on Carol's mouth

          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Larry looks very frightened.

                          LARRY

           Oh, my... Oh, my God. D... Don't hurt her !

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Paul is holding the gag in front of Carol's mouth with one hand

          and the telephone with the other hand.

                          PAUL

           I'll tell you exactly where to meet me, and you bring that

           package I want. Now, once I have it and I'm safely gone,

           you'll get your wife back. Otherwise, I'll kill her.

          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Larry is now very very frightened.

                          LARRY

           Yes, yes. Yeah, no, no, no, no. I... I... I understand. I,

           uh, yes, no. I'll be there. I'll be there. I... I... Yes,

           I'll b... I... I'll bring your wife's body, she... In...

           in... in the trunk of my car. Yes, I'll... I... I promise.

           I'll be there. I...

          Larry hangs up and hold the side of the phone booth.

                          LARRY

           I don't have his wife's body. Bluff, bluff.

          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Long shot of a street covered with iron works. Actually, this is

          the same street and the same shot as the one we saw earlier in the

          film, when Ted and Carol were following Helen going to Paul's

          movie house in a yellow cab.

          Larry's car is coming toward us, and then turns into the dead-end

          street where the back entrance of Paul's movie house is located.

          DEAD END STREET BEHIND PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Larry stops the car near the entrance of the movie house. Paul is

          waiting for him.

          Medium close shot on Larry's car. Larry opens his door, and comes

          out of the car.

                          LARRY

           Where's Carol ?

          Paul walks toward the car. He's got a gun in his hand.

                          PAUL

           First show me Lillian's body.

                          LARRY

           I... I got it.

                          PAUL

           There's no way she could have survived that vat of molten

           steel.

                          LARRY

           No, no, I... I... I got...

                          PAUL

           If you're not bluffing, where is she ?

                          LARRY

           Why are you so nervous ? What are you so nervous about ?

                          PAUL

           Where ?

                          LARRY

           If I don't have her, what are you so nervous ?

                          PAUL

           Where is she ?

                          LARRY

           I got her in the trunk of my car.

                          PAUL

           Open it. Come on, now.

                          LARRY

           I... I got her.

                          PAUL

           If she's not there, I'll put a bullet through your head.

           Now, open it !

                          LARRY

           I... I...

          Larry walks around his car toward the trunk.

                          PAUL

           Come on! Come on!

          Larry opens the trunk.

                          PAUL

           Step back!

          Larry takes something in the trunk, then closes it back, but the

          door of the trunk doesn't close well and opens again. Larry walks

          back to Paul and shows him what he's got in his hand.

                          LARRY

           No, no, I got her. See, if I don't have her, how come I got

           her ring ? I got her ring, there. This is... This is her

           ring.

                          PAUL

           I think you're lying !

          He walks to the open trunk.

                          LARRY

           It's a... No, no, no, no. Uh.

          Paul takes a bad-looking dummy out of the trunk. Apparently, it is

          an amateur dummy that Larry has made himself.

                          PAUL

           What is this ? What is this ?

          He throws the dummy back in the trunk.

                          LARRY

           I could never bluff.

                          PAUL

           What ?

                          LARRY

           I... I... I've lost a fortune in cards over the years.

                          PAUL

           Listen to me.

                          LARRY

           I'm not a bluffer.

                          PAUL

           I'm going to put a... Get a...

          They start fighting.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Carol is still tied and gagged on the chair. She tries desperately

          to get free.

          DEAD END STREET BEHIND PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot on Larry and Paul, still fighting. Larry succeeds in

          getting away from Paul, who fires his gun. But, apparently, Larry

          is not hit by the gunshot, because he runs toward the back

          entrance of the movie house. The camera follows him.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot on the staircase on the side of the backstage. Larry

          runs down the stairs, while we hear the sound of the Lady from

          Shangai. The Lady from Shangai is a 1947 film written, directed

          and played by Orson Welles.

           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)

           That's what Grisby thought. But, of course, she meant to

           kill Grisby, too. After he'd served his purpose. Poor

           howling idiot.

          Larry has now reached the backstage. He is behind the screen, a

          small part of which is seen on the side of the shot.

           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)

           He never even did that. He went and shot Broome. And that

           was not part of the plan. Broome might have got to the

           police before he died.

          Larry walks around the backstage, trying to find his way. We see

          the black and white film on the screen, but also reflections of

          the screen on the multiple mirrors scattered around the backstage.

           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)

           And if the cops traced it to Grisby... and the cops made

           Grisby talk, he'd spill everything.

          Medium shot on the staircase. Paul is walking very slowly

          downstairs.

           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)

           And she'd be finished, so she had to shut up Grisby but

           quick.

          Back on Larry, still trying to find his way around the backstage.

           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)

           And I was the fall guy.

          Full shot on the screen, where a man is falling down a long slide,

          like the one used by kids on playgrounds. We hear the film music.

          Medium close shot on two mirrors, one behind the other. On the

          mirrors, we see the reflection of the screen. Paul is slowly

          walking from behind the first mirror, his gun in hand.

          Full shot on the mirrors, with Larry walking cautiously among

          them.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium shot on Carol in the small room. She is still trying to get

          free from her bonds and gag.

           ELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film)

           Why don't you try to understand ?

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY

          Back to the mirrors showing numerous reflections of the screen.

           ELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film)

           He was mad. He had to be shot.

           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)

           And what about me ?

          Paul walks in, his gun in his hand.

           ELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film)

           We could have gone off together.

          Close shot of Larry half-hidden behind a large mirror.

           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)

           One who follows his nature, keeps his original nature in

           the end.

          Larry inadvertently drops the large mirror on the floor. The

          mirror breaks with a crashing sound.

           CAROL (voice over)

           Help ! Help !

          The camera pans to Paul, walking slowly with his gun pointed

          toward Larry.

                          PAUL

           They can't see us behind the screen, and they can't hear us

           with the sound on. Not even a gunshot.

          Behind Paul, we see the film on the screen. We have now reached

          the famous last scene of the film, shot in the hall of mirrors.

          Rita Hayworth's face is reflected on the many mirrors in the film,

          just like, in the actual scene in the backstage, Paul and Larry

          are reflected on the many mirrors scattered around.

           ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)

           I knew I'd find you two together.

          Arthur's figure, walking with a cane, is reflected in the many

          mirrors in the film. Just the same, Gladys, who has just entered

          the backstage, walking with a cane, is also reflected on the

          mirrors scattered around her. She has a gun in the hand which is

          not holding the cane.

          While Gladys and Paul are talking, the film keeps on showing on

          the screen behind them, but we do not understand the words from

          the film, because Paul and Gladys' voices are louder.

                          GLADYS

           Hallo, Paul. Didn't you expect me ?

          Medium shot on the mirrors, showing several reflections of Paul.

                          PAUL

           Mrs. Dalton.

          Close shot on Gladys' face. While she is talking, the camera pans

          away from her, showing her reflection on a mirror.

                          GLADYS

           You made a lot of promises to me, over the years. And then,

           you decided to dump me for that young model.

          The camera keeps on panning, showing another reflection of Gladys.

           PAUL (voice over)

           I never led you on.

           GLADYS (with a very harsh voice)

           It's late for excuses.

          Medium shot on the mirrors showing several reflections of Paul.

                          PAUL

           None of you can prove anything.

          Full shot of the screen, showing Arthur and his numerous

          reflections on the mirrors in the film.

           ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)

           So you'd be foolish to fire that gun.

          Low angle shot on the staircase, showing Larry going down the

          stairs.

           ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)

           With these mirrors, it's difficult to tell. You are aiming

           at me, aren't you ?

                          LARRY

           Carol ? Carol ? Carol ?

          Medium shot of Gladys and one of her reflections.

                          GLADYS

           I'm aiming at you, lover.

           ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)

           Of course, killing you is killing myself.

                          GLADYS

           Of course, killing you is killing myself.

           ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)

           It's the same thing.

                          GLADYS

           But you know, I'm pretty tired of both of us.

          She fired her gun twice

          Medium shot on the many reflections of Paul. He fires his gun

          twice. We hear noises of mirrors being broken by the gunshots,

          both in the film, and on the backstage itself.

          Medium shot of Gladys and one of her reflections. She turns

          around, not being sure, because of the mirrors, of Paul's exact

          location.

          Medium shot of Paul walking on the backstage. We still hears

          noises of mirrors being broken, but we don't know if the noises

          come from the film or the backstage.

          Medium shot of Gladys and several of the reflections.

          Medium shot of the floor of the backstage. We see the bottom of

          the screen and, of course, the film projected on it, and in which

          the mirrors are being broken. Paul enters from behind a mirror

          frame, and falls on the floor. Gladys' reflection appears in

          several mirrors. She stops and looks at Paul's body lying on the

          floor.

          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

          Medium close shot of Larry entering the room. He rushes to Carol,

          and takes her gag off.

                          LARRY

           God ! Are you okay ? Are you okay ?

          He hugs and kisses her.

                          CAROL

           Oh, God, Larry ! Oh, Larry, I'm so happy to see you !

                          LARRY

           Jesus, I was, I was never so glad to see somebody in my

           life. Are you all right ?

          He starts untying her hands.

                          CAROL

           Yes, I'm all right.

                          LARRY

           You don't know what's going on out there. I'll never say

           that life doesn't imitate art again. I'm... I'm... Oh,

           gee...

                          CAROL

           We... we gotta call the police, Larry.

                          LARRY

           Yes, and... and... and... a glazier.

                          CAROL

           I know. Oh, God.

                          LARRY

           Quick, quick. Dial, dial, dial.

          He picks up the telephone, and Carol, whose hands are now

          completely free, starts dialing.

                          CAROL

           Larry. Oh, God, Larry. Oh, God. Oh, honey. Oh, God. Ow !

           Ow ! Oh, God ! Jesus !

          Larry hugs and kisses her again.

                          LARRY

           I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, wife mine.

          He takes the rope away, but he does it so nervously that he almost

          takes Carol's head off !

                          CAROL

           Aow ! Aow !

           (talking in the phone)

           Hello ?

                          LARRY

           Wife mine.

                          CAROL

           Oh, God.

          NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE POLICE STATION - EXTERIOR DAY

          Medium close shot on the top part of the door of the police

          station. A sign says : 4th precinct 621.

          The camera tilts down. Three uniformed policemen are standing on

          the sidewalk near the door. Marcia and Ted come out of the

          station, and stop at the entrance.

                          TED

           God, it's... it's so complicated. I can't... Can't keep

           track of it all.

                          MARCIA

           Oh, listen. I'll give it to you one more time.

          Marcia takes a cigarette, and Ted lights it with his lighter.

                         FLASHBACK SCENE

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Medium shot. It's dinner time in Paul's apartment. Paul and

          Lilian's sister are seated around the table. Lilian comes in from

                         THE KITCHEN

           MARCIA (voice over)

           Mrs. House had a sister who moved to England many years

           ago.

          Lilian gives a glass of wine to her sister.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           She changed her name when she married.

          Lilian gives a glass of wine to Paul.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           Her husband died. She moved back to New York recently, a

           very, very rich widow... but a recluse.

          Lilian's sister has a heart attack. Paul helps her walk away from

          the table to the sofa.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           Mr. and Mrs. House knew they weren't in her will. They have

           her over to dinner, she accidentally keels over. I guessed

           right there.

          Lilian's sister is lying dead on the sofa, and Lilian, wearing a

          pink night-robe, is dressing her sister in her own clothes.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           She has a reasonable resemblance to her sister, so they

           fake it... Pretend Lillian House died. They cremate the

           sister.

          The camera pans to Paul talking on the telephone.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           Lillian checks into a fleabag joint... and for several

           weeks she pretends to be her sister... closing her

           accounts, liquidating her assets, accumulating big money.

          The camera pans back to the sofa, where Lilian is still dressing

          her sister.

           MARCIA (voice over)

           What she didn't realize was that her husband was two-timing

           her with Helen Moss, this pretty model.

          NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE POLICE STATION - EXTERIOR DAY

          Back to the entrance of the police station, where Ted and Marcia

          are still talking. They start walking along the street.

                          MARCIA

           So, he decides not to cut her in and go off to... I don't

           know... With his mistress and, uh, keep all the dough. So,

           he kills Lillian. He cremates her, or pours molten steel

           all over her or something... and, uh, that's when we came

           along and tripped him up.

          Medium shot of Ted and Marcia slowly walking behind the police

          cars parked near the station.

                          TED

           He had some great alibis.

                          MARCIA

           Yeah, that woman that worked for him ?

                          TED

           Yeah.

                          MARCIA

           Mrs. Dalton ? She covered for him. She loved him. Not that

           she dreamed he was a murderer.

                          TED

           What do you... What do you... I want, I want to celebrate,

           or something. What do you wanna do ? You wanna... Wanna go

           see what, uh, what Larry and Carol are up to ?

                          MARCIA

           I think they wanna be alone.

                          TED

           Oh, yeah. Uh, okay. All right. Uh, well, you have any

           plans ?

                          MARCIA

           You're taking me to dinner, right ?

                          TED

           Yeah, right. Absolutely. Only we can't sleep together.

                          MARCIA

           Why not ?

                          TED

           Not... not tonight.

                          MARCIA

           Why not ?

                          TED

           Well, I already slept with Helen Moss once today, and I'm

           not young and active like I used to be.

                          MARCIA

           You'll do anything to catch a murderer, won't you ?

          NEW-YORK - LARRY'S RESIDENCE STREET - EXTERIOR DAY

          Full shot of the corner of the street where Larry's building is

          located. The pavement is wet from a recent rain. Carol and Larry

          are coming around the corner of the street.

                          LARRY

           What an experience.

                          CAROL

           Oh, really one.

                          LARRY

           I'm... I'm still vibrating.

                          CAROL

           I know.

                          LARRY

           Incredible.

          Carol, who was walking quite rapidly, suddenly slows down. Track

          shot of Larry and Carol, with the camera in front of them

                          CAROL

           Oh, you know, Larry, you were surprisingly brave.

                          LARRY

           What do you mean surprisingly ?

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           You seem shocked.

                          CAROL

           Well...

                          LARRY

           You know, I'm a pretty good guy, you know.

                          CAROL

           Well, you know... Yeah, I know, uh...

                          LARRY

           Where do you wanna go for dinner tonight ? Let's not go to

           any restaurant where they serve cowards.

          Carol laughs.

                          CAROL

           I don't know.

                          LARRY

           I... What are you laughing at ?

                          CAROL

           You know, Larry, I love you. I love you.

                          LARRY

           How could you have ever been jealous of Marcia ? Isn't that

           ridiculous ? Don't you know that I could only love you ?

                          CAROL

           You were jealous of Ted.

                          LARRY

           Ted ?

                          CAROL

           Yeah.

                          LARRY

           You've got to be kidding. Take away his-his-his elevator

           shoes and his fake suntan and his capped teeth... and what

           do you have ?

                          CAROL

           You.

          Larry laughs. They have reached their building and they enter it.

                          LARRY

           Right. I love that.

                          CAROL

           I...

          An attendant opens the door for them. Through the glass doors, we

          see them cross the lobby toward the elevator.
