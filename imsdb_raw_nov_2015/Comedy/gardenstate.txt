                         IN BLACK:

          AIRPLANE PILOT (O.S.)

          (panicky; through crackly

                         RADIO)

          Los Angeles Tower, this is

          Transworld two-two Heavy, we are

          going down! Repeat... Engines two

          and three are... L.A. Tower this is

          MaydayI Mayday!

          TOWER (O.S.)

          (through crackly radio)

          2-2 Heavy, Pull upt Pull up!

          The RADIO NOISE is drowned out by the A CAPELLA, SOPRANO

          VOICE of a young Indian boy as he sings a melodic Hindi

          prayer.

          INT. AIRPLANE CABIN --- NIGHT

          THE WORST NIGHTMARE IMAGINABLE:

          SLOW MOTION: The plane is going down fasts Everyone panics

          and screams in SLOW MOTION as the oxygen masks away like

          plastic pendulums. The SOPRANO VOICE continues the prayer.

          ANDREW LARGEMAN (LARGE), 25, is the only passenger who

          remains unfazed. Even as the flames from the wing echo fiery

          reflections on his cheeks, even as the young mother seated

          next to him clutches her newborn and wails towards God, even

          as bags fall from the overhead compartment at half-speed and

          the beverage cart slides down the aisle, Andrew Largeman sits

          peacefully; unaffected.

          He calmly reaches up and turns his air vent so it blows

          directly on him. He looks up to

          THE FASTEN SEAT BELT SIGN

          it BINGS as the light flashes on and off. The BINGING

          continues more and more frequently; at first in rhythm with

          the prayer and then it dissolves into the RING of an

          ELECTRONIC TELEPHONE.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING

          Whiteness. Morning sun streams through a palatial picture

          window. THE PHONE continues to RING. A ceiling fan spins

          above stacks of scripts, a cell phone charging, bare walls

          and a small human figure dwarfed by the enormous white bed in

          which he sleeps.

          HIS BYES bounce back and forth under their lids as he dreams

          like they're chasing each other in a game of tag.

          THE PHONE is finally answered by the machine. Large's eyes

          stop moving.

                         2

          VOICE ON MACHINE (0.S.)

          Andrew... This is your father.

          LARGE'S EYES slowly float open.

                         VOICE

          Hi, hello, it's uh. Look uh, you

          don't call me back so I don't know

          how to do this. If I can't... if

          you're not gonna return my calls

          then there's no way for us to

          communicate. So uh...

          '(starts to cry)

          Look, I don't know how to do . this,

          but you're gonna need to come home

          now. Last night uh... Your mother

          died last night, Andrew. She uhh...

          I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But she

          uh... she drowned... last night she

          drowned in the bath...

          BEEP. The machine cuts the voice off.

          LARGE'S EYES processing.

          They elide slowly left, then back right as if scanning in

          data. He blinks. He blinks again slowly. His eyelids float

          closed. He falls back to sleep.

          FADE TO BLACK-'

                         IN BLACK:

          The RUSH OF WATER from the bathroom sink.

          INT. BATHROOM -- MORNING

          Large appears to stare directly at us. He's dazed. His body

          is there, but his mind seems absent. He reaches to the middle

          of the frame, almost at us, and pulls open both doors of the

          mirror he's been staring into.

          His face and chest are immediately replaced with the two

          dozen orange prescription drug canisters that immaculately

          line the shelves of his medicine cabinet.

          He closes the mirror doors and stares at himself.

          MUSIC CUB., ("DON'T PANIC" BY COLDPLAY)

          EXT. CENTURY CITY PAVILION -- LATER

          Large rushes through throngs of people on their lunch break.

          He manages to avoid eye contact with all of them as he tries

          to find an address while checking a piece of paper.

          He boards an outdoor escalator and starts climbing thL-

          stairs.

                         0

                         3

          After a moment he looks to his right through a window into a

          gym where a man on a Stairmaster is walking alongside him.

          Large registers something: he isn't going anywhere.

          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal he's been walking up on the

          down side. He stands still and lets it bring him all the way

          down, where he moves to the "Up" one and rises towards the

          next level. His expression never changes.

          INT. CASTING OFFICE -- DAY

          A casting assistant sits behind stacks of headshots and

          manilla envelopes while the PHONE RINGS constantly. Large

          sits next to another actor that looks exactly like him;

          they're even dressed alike.

                         ASSISTANT

          Casting, please hold. casting,

          please hold.

          WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL: they are sitting beneath an eight

          foot photograph of "Urkel" wagging his finger at the camera.

          A slow 360 degree pan around the room reveals ten other

          actors identical to Large aggressively rehearsing their lines

          to themselves.

          The ACTOR seated next to Large leans over to him.

                         ACTOR

          We're whores.

          Large looks at him.

           ACTOR (CONT' D )

           "I'm not a whore," you say. And to

          that I say, "If you would do

          this... that you would do ' this...

          you're a whore." 'But it pays the

          bills," you say; startin' to get a

          little pissed. And to that I say:

          "how do whores, how do you think a

          hooker justifies what she does to

          her non-hooker friends?"

                         (BEAT)

          It pays the bills.

                         (READING)

          "Codey, an extreme, special-ope

          hacker with an edge.' What the fuck

          is an "edge"? Can you explain

          "edge" to me? Is it just messy

          hair?

                         (BEAT)

          Hey, wait. Aren't you the guy who

          booked the retarded quarterback?

          An overweight casting assistant enters.

                         ASSISTANT

          Lukas Fox?

                         ACTOR

          Yeah, hey Sandy.

                         ASSISTANT

          Leslie.

                         ACTOR

          (under his breath)

          Fuck.

                         ASSISTANT

          come on in.

          (to the room)

          Hey guys, we're only doing the

          first scene okay; the "I'll cut

          you!" scene. Thanks.

                         ACTOR

          Good talking with you, bro.

                         (BEAT)

          Peace.

          We hold on Large as he swings his gaze to the actor on his

          other side aggressively running his lines to the air.

          INT. LARGE' S CAR -- DAY

          Hazy and claustrophobic in stopped traffic on the 405

          freeway. Large stares absently out the window as BLARING

          SIRENS. compete with the obnoxious ramblings of L.A. TALK

          RADIO.

          Large suddenly squints his eyes and clutches his neck in

          pain.

          EXT. FANCY HOLLYWOOD VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Large pulls his car into a parking spot, throws "The Club" on

          his steering wheel and heads towards the back door of the

          restaurant. But something catches his eye on the side of his

          car.

          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL: a gasoline pump nozzle

          sitting in his gas tank with a foot of tattered hose ripped

          off at the end. He stares at it, trying to remember the last

          time he bought gas. He looks both ways and covertly pulls the

          nozzle from his tank.

          He walks towards the back door of the restaurant and throws

          the nozzle in an open dumpater.

          INT. FANCY HOLLYWOOD VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Large flings open the door and enters a long, dark corridor

          lined with stacked chairs. He passes a WAITER in a black

          TUNIC wearing eye make-up to make him look Asian.

                         WAITER

          Dick head. You've got thirty-four

          and twenty-five seated and Taylor

          booked a pilot so he quit. You

          picked a bad night to be late.

                         5

          Large glides through the chaotic environment unfazed by any

          of the stress. He rounds a corner to a time card machine and

          swipes his card. The machine BEEPS and displays the word,

          "LATE" in red. He crosses to a locker and quickly changes

          into a black tunic and pants.

          He moves through the kitchen which is whirling with over

          thirty people in white: chopping, frying, sauteing, YELLING.

          The Vietnamese chef wears a headset and BARKS ORDERS down the

          line. Large is met by a FRENCH WOMAN MANAGER. She walks with

          him as he weaves his way through the kitchen.

                         FRENCH MANAGER

                         (FRENCH ACCENT)

          Ten resumes just today. They come

          in everyday from Idaho or Florida

          or Milwaukee and do you know what

          they want even more than a guest

          spot on "Everybody Loves Raymond"?

          They want your job. This will not

          happen again. This will never

          happen again. You have two tables.

          You are thirty minutes late; if I

          ever say this again, your job will

                         GO TO:

          She pulls off the top resume from the bunch she's grasping;

          revealing a headshot on the other side.

          FRENCH MANAGER (CONT'D)

          Todd Slauson from Duluth,

          Minnesota.

          During all this, Large remains calm and unphased. He takes a

          stick of eye make-up from the pocket of the tunic and paints

          his eyes to appear Asian. (As do all the white, good-looking,

          male waiters.)

          He takes a small radio transceiver device from the pocket of

          the tunic and turns it on. He unwinds the ear piece, pulls it

          through the back of his jacket, out the neck and into his

          ear. Immediately we hear a VIETNAMESE MAN'S VOICE giving

          orders over the ear piece.

          VIETNAMESE VOICE (O.S.)

          (accented, but monotone)

          Waiter number fifteen, your table

          number twenty-three is ready.

          Large takes a deep breath and pushes open the door into:

          INT. DINING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

          A very fancy Hollywood Vietnamese restaurant filled to

          capacity with a Friday evening crowd. The energy is

          completely different from the other side of the door. SOFT

          ASIAN MUSIC' plays, the room is very dim and lit by

          candlelight.

                         0

          VIETNAMESE VOICE (O.S.)

                         (THROUGH EARPIECE)

          Waiter ten, you forgot the order of

          forty-one for table one-o-one. All

          waiters, eighty-six tuna special.

          Large remains dead-pan as he crosses to a table with six

          young, hot Hollywood types.

          YOUNG HOLLYWOOD GUY

          What the fuck, man? What are you on

          break?

          Large doesn't respond.

          YOUNG HOLLYWOOD GUY (CONT'D)

          Don't worry about it; I'm just

          messin' with ya. Lemme get three

          Kettle Red Bulls arid...

                         REELING GIRL

          Can I have a Kettle Cosmo with Red

          Bull, please. And some bread too. A-

          sap.

                         LARGE

          We don't have bread.

                         REELING GIRL

          What do you mean you don't have

          bread? How could you not have

          bread?

                         LARGE

          We just don't have bread it's...

          we're a Vietnamese restaurant.

                         REELING GIRL

          Well you're not Vietnamese.

                         LARGE

          No, I'm not.

                         REELING GIRL

          So?

                         (BEAT)

          Well something to chew on --fuck.

          Bamboo... whatever.

                         LARGE

          I'll see what I can find.

          He turns and walks off .

          VIETNAMESE VOICE (O.S.)

          Waiter number twelve, flight number

          121 with non-stop service to Newark

          ON LARGE'S FACE CLOSE as he closes his eyes and we:

          FADE TO BLACK:

                         IN BLACK:

          THE BLARE OF A JET LINER TARING OFF dissolves into

          INT. AIRPORT BATHROOM -- DAY

          THE RUSH OF WATER as Large washes his hands at the last Oink

          in a very long row. He grabs his neck while SQUINTING his

          eyes closed in pain for a brief second.

          A moment later he picks up his bag and heads down the line of

          sinks. As he passes each sink, he unknowingly activates their

          motion sensors and each faucet SHOOTS a tiny burst of water.

          The NASALLY VOICE of a WOMAN SINGING an off key version of

          "Once, Twice, Three Times A Lady" with synthesizer

          accompaniment.

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          A large group of people are gathered around a steel coffin.

          Atop the coffin site a framed picture of a tired looking

          woman in a wheelchair. This is SARAH LARGEMAN.

          We find SYLVIA LARGEMAN, the source of the music. CLOSE ON

          HER FACE as the assorted palette of colored make-up on her

          cheeks swirls together with tears until it collects on the

          tip of her chin and drips like a leaky faucet onto:

          HER LYRICS SHEET as a rainbow of tears splatter the words

          "ONCE and "TWICE".

          The song finishes and the rabbi begins a series of Hebrew

          prayers. Large squints through the mourners to see his father

          GIDEON LARGEMAN shovel a handful of dirt onto the casket.

          Behind him stands CYNTHIA DILLARD, 25, a beautiful young

          Black woman.

          HIS FOCUS RACKS TO REVEAL two young men seated on a rusty

          tractor smoking cigarettes about thirty yards behind the

          ceremony.

          WE JUMP CUT TO after the ceremony as Large weaves through the

          crowd and approaches the two men. We see now they are HA-RKs

          26, good looking in a dirty way. And DAVE, 26. They are quite

          filthy, but each sports expensive jewelry and black

          yarmulkes.

          They look up as Large approaches.

          INT. LARGEMAN HOUSE: LIVING ROOM - DAY

           TIGHT ON: An enormous portrait photograph that fills a wall;

          in it, Large (as a young boy), Sarah (not yet in a

          wheelchair) and Gideon Largeman huddle together with a Black

          woman and her young daughter (Cynthia) against a white

          background. They all wear white t--shirts, blue jeans and no

          socks. Everyone but Sarah smiles widely into the lens.

          "Shiva" is in full swing as forty or so older suburban Jewish

          New Jersey'ites of every shape and size mingle over small

          food and small talk. The camera moves past several

                         CONVERSATIONS:

          A heavy woman with gobs of make-up and lots of gold.

                         WOMAN 1

          .Well you had to call her; she

          never called anyone.

          A woman in a white tennis outfit talking to a group.

                         WOMAN 2

          This was a woman who never smiled.

          An older man in glasses with cream cheese all over his lips.

                         MAN 1

          Somebody ate all the lox.

          THE CAMERA MOVES TO: Two very Jewish older ladies

          simultaneously telling the same story to a group of friends.

                         LADY 1

          The new thing is "Talk to the

          hand."

                         LADY 2

          That's what they're doing.

                         LADY 1

          But you got a hold it out like

          this.

                         LADY 2

          Like you're saying...

          "I don't have the time for you."

                         LADY 2

          "So talk to my hand."

          Large site on a couch in the den next to his Aunt Sylvia, the

          singer from the funeral. Some young children play on the rug

          in front of them. Large stares off into space as she pets one

          of the children's heads and looks to Large for conversation.

                         SYLVIA

          Did you know your mother redid the

          hallway bathroom?

          Large looks over, realizing she's talking to him.

                         LARGE

          What? Sorry. Who?

                         SYLVIA

          Since I met her she never showed an

          interest in anything. Then all of a

          sudden a month ago she wakes up and

          decides to redecorate a bathroom. I

          helped her.

                         LARGE

          That's great.

          (trying his best)

          I'll bet it was... fun.

                         SYLVIA

          Well I sew. I made you something.

                         LARGE

          Me? Thank you. Did you... sew it?

                         SYLVIA

          Great.

                         LARGE

          Great. I'll wear it.

                         SYLVIA

          Will you try it on nowt

                         LARGE

          Now?

                         SYLVIA

          Well just in case I have to fix it

          before you leave again and we don't

          see you for another nine years, I

          want to make sure it fits.

                         LARGE

          oh. okay.

                         SYLVIA

          You're gonna love the material. I

          used the leftovers from your

          Mother's design. Gorgeous.

          INT. HALLWAY BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          Large flips the light on to reveal the entire bathroom is

          done in the same floral pattern; everything: wallpaper,

          towels, curtains. He looks down at the shirt; it's the same

          pattern.

          He slides his sweater off to reveal his pale, thin chest. He

          stares at himself in the mirror for a moment. He tilts his

          head to the right and stares at his body.

          He pulls the shirt on and buttons up the front. As he does

          his entire chest and person disappear into the design of the

          room. He looks at himself in the mirror; it looks like his

          head and forearms are floating in mid-air.

          Large almost smiles as he makes his forearms dance around in

          mid-air.

          volunteers as an EMT for the Rescue

          I've been getting these pretty bad

          headaches lately. It feels like a

          quick little lightning storm in my

          brain and then it's gone. I was

          thinking maybe you could set me up

          to get it checked out while I'm

          here.

          The bathroom in the hall. I noticed

          Yeah. That's new. Did you eat? You

          INT. LARGE 'S BEDROOM -- DAY

          A tattered, vintage American Flag site framed above the bed.

          Large eases past all the shelves; trinkets, nothing seems to

          mean anything and then

                         A PICTURE

          Several people are seated amongst dozens of presents

          laughing. A. seven year old Large stands with his arm around

          a seven year old Cynthia. They both wear enormous "chicken-

          foot" slippers and smile from ear to ear.

          Large's POV: zooms into the face of the only person in the

          photo not smiling. This is Sarah Largeman. She stands; not

          yet requiring a wheelchair.

          He crosses to the bed and sits down. The surface sends waves

          ,towards the pillows throwing them off the bed, revealing it's

                         A WATERBED-

          A LOUD RING from a PHONE on the bedside table which appears

          to be made out of Legos. He answers it.

                         LARGE

          Hello?... Hey. No... Yes.

          INT. THE GARAGE - NIGHT

          Large pulls away a tarp to reveal a classic world War II Army

          motorcycle with a sidecar. The corner of hie mouth raises and

          holds the idea of a smile.

          MUSIC CUE: "REMY ZERO"

          EXT. STREETS NIGHT

          Large flies through the suburban sprawl without a helmet. THE

          MUSIC BLASTS.

          The wind throws his hair back as Large whips through the back

          roads. He's going really fast. He closes his eyes, flying by

          a COP CAR doing eighty before he opens them again. LIGHTS

          FLASH behind him as he pulls over.

                         LARGE

          Fuck.

          The cop car stops behind him and blares him with the search

          light.

                         COP

          Large does it. All we can see is a silhouette of a figure

          standing amidst the blaring lights and swirling blue and red

          colors.

                         COP (CONT'D)

           Large takes it. out and passes it behind him, squinting. When

           the COP gets it, he steps finally into the 1 ght. He's a

          skinny kid, maybe 23, with a baby face!

                         LARGE

          Yeah. You too.

          Benny gets in his car and pulls up alongside Large. He picks

          up the CB and the PA CRACKLES on:

          Pull over, the vehicle!

          Kenny nods his head up and down to Large like "Isn't this

          cool?" Large waves goodbye. Kenny floors the cop car and

          BLARES the SIREN with LIGHTS FLASHING as be SCREECHES away.

          TNT.GLEASON KITCHEN --- NIGHT

          A bunch of people are gathered around Mark as he tells a

          drunken story. The group laughs.

                         MARK

          holy chit look at this guy!

          Everyone looks to Large at the end of the line.

                         MARK (CONT'D)

          Get the fuck up here, bitch! This

          guy does not wait for a beer! This

          is a movie star! This is Jersey's

          DeNiro and shit.

          Mark sloppily hugs Large. Others slap him five as Large

          awkwardly navigates between variations of hugs and

          handshakes.

                         DRUNK

          What are you doin home?

          A beat as Large realizes he has to answer that question.

          You like that? That's

          INT. GLEASON HALLWAY - CONTINUOS

          They walk through the crowd as Mark recruits cute girls to

          join them upstairs. They walk up the stairs past family

          pictures and school photos made crooked by drunken backs.

          Mark points to a photo of an awkward looking young man.

                         MARK

          You see this?

          Did you know him?

                         MARK

          Nah. Ugly motherfucker though, huh?

          It pains Large to even try to respond to that.

                         MARK (CONT'D)

          You want to see the most fucked up

          thing?

          They arrive at the landing outside a door with a "New Jersey

          Devils" poster on it.

          MARK (CONT`D)

          This is the tucked up thing.

          Be swings the door to the bedroom open revealing the dark

          bedroom of your average teenage boy. A teenage couple

          drunkenly makes out on the bed. The mattress has no sheets.

                         MARK (CONT'D)

          Check that out.

          Mark points to a hole in the ceiling where a ceiling fan has

          been ripped out. Wires dangle. The fan lies next to the bed.

          INT. GOLF ROOM __ CONTINUOUS

          Everything in the room is golf. it is one man's wood paneled

          shrine to the sport of golf: golf carpet, posters,

          autographs, etc. A group of people sit around the couch

          drinking beer,. passing joints. Smoky, dark.

          Large notices JESSE, a wiry 25 year old in thick glasses.

                         LARGE

          Yeah... So I definitely wanna come

          by and check out your new pad. You

          gotta tell me what happened.

                         JESSE

          Basically, "The Man bought my

          silent Velcro patent.

                         LARGE

          What?

          right?

                         LARGE

          No. But I haven't seen you since we

                         WERE SIXTEEN-

                         JESSE

          Oh well yeah... I wasn't really an

          inventor yet. Anyway I developed

          this little item that's just like

          Velcro but doesn't make that

          annoying Velcro noise.

                         LARGE

          now much did they buy it for?

                         JESSE

          A lot.

                         LARGE

          Wow. So what are you doing now?

                         JESSE

          Nothing.

          They laugh.

                         LARGE

          Seriously.

                         JESSE

          Seriously. Absolutely nothing. I've

          never been so bored in all my life.

          The first month I bought a whole

          bunch of shit, but then that got

          boring. But I... nothing.

                         24

                         LARGE

          That's so crazy. But I mean like,

          are you gonna travel or like what

          are you gonna do? Shouldn't you

          like help starving kids or

          something?

                         JESSE

          I'm not really motivated to do much

          at all. It's kind of funny, I guess

          I had kind of planned on my whole

          life being about struggling to get

          money. But now that I've got more

          than I ever dreamed, I'm really not

          sure what to do with myself. I

          stare at walls a lot.

                         DAVE

          Can you believe that shit, Large?

          This guy has one idea and he's a

          trillionaire. I got a thousand

          ideas, but I gotta sit around and

          wait for all my relatives to die.

          They join the group. Mark blows coke off a large golf book.

          Dave has a young girl on his lap. Large begins to notice that

          the girls in the room, although quite attractive, are pretty

          young; 17-19.

          As he pans the room, he lock eyes with a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG

          GIRL. They play chicken briefly to see who will break the

          stare first. Large does and looks to his right where someone

          has just passed him a joint- He hits it and passes it on.

                         MARK

          Here, bro.

          He passes Large the golf book.

                         LARGE

          Oh no thanks, man.

                         MARK

          Really? But you're like a movie

          star and shit.

                         LARGE

          No, no thanks.

                         JESSE

          Well then here. Eat this.

          Jesse opens his palm to reveal a tiny hit of E with a SMILEY

          FACE on it.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)

          Welcome home.

                         A

                         25

          Large takes it in his hand and thinks about it. He looks

          around at everyone else in the room eating them; including

          the cute girls.

                         LARGE

          I guess I'll see youguyslater.

          He eats the hit. They laugh.

                         DANA

          Should we play a game?

                         DAVE

          other than golf?

          They laugh.

                         KELLY

          No, let's play Spin The Bottle.

          The idea is met with mixed reaction from the group.

                         LARGE

                         (TO JESSE)

          I'm not playing Spin The Bottle;

          how old are we? or more

          importantly, how old are they?

          Jesse passes Large the joint.

                         JESSE

          They're all legal. I think.

          He smiles a toothy grin. KELLY, a young hot girl with a raspy

          voice takes control.

                         KELLY

          Well we just ate all this fuckin'

          ex, what the hell else are we gonna

          do?

                         JESSE

          The girl has a point.

                         MARK

          Okay, how 'bout this.

          He holds up a bottle of Tequila with a ribbon around !.to

          neck.

                         MARK (CONT'D}

          First let's finish Daddy's golf

          tequila. Then we can use this

          bottle.

          The group loves this idea- As they laugh and party the CAIa.ERA

          FINDS ITS WAY to Large's face as he feels the weed and the

          beginning of his trip. His eyes and face navigate the ha3mnv

          start.

                         26

          THE REST OF THIS SCENE WILL VACILLATE BETWEEN REGULAR, SPED-

          UP AND SLOW MOTION.

          The party seems to fast forward around Large; the MUSIC FADES

          TO ONE LOW NOTE until it breaks with people calling his name.

                         ALL

          Large!

          He snaps his attention to the game. The bottle is pointed

          directly at him.

                         JESSE

          Largeman, this is Dana.

          Large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes

          with before. She smiles at him. Awkwardness fills the room.

                         DANA

          Hi.

                         LARGE

          (snapping out of it)

          Oh, who's up?

          They all laugh. She gets up and slowly walks over to the

          couch. She smiles nervously. Large stares at her. we see in

          his eyes he's feeling more fucked up every instant. She

          stands above him at the couch, then straddles him with her

          knees on either side of his legs; sitting on his lap.

          The MUSIC PLAYS.

          Everyone is speechless. she slowly leans in. Eye contact.

          They kiss softly enjoying every second. Its incredibly sexy.

          HIS FINGERS CLUTCH HER THIGH

          They stop and look at each other. She kisses him on the cheek

          and gets up. Everyone reacts and some clap.

                         JESSE

          This is gonna be a good night.

          Everything SPEEDS-UP and SLOWS DOWN. A barrage of images:

          people hooking up, girls kissing girls, guys feeling girls

          up, joints being passed, one girl crying, Mark showing off

          his golf swing, Large trying to take deep breaths, Jesse and

          Dave hugging, two-figures moving quickly under a blanket.

          Kenny in full riot gear letting people take turns hitting him

          in his helmet.

          FASTER : hands gripping each other, a nose on a neck, hands

          gripping a waist.

          Ecu s Largos face as his eyes swim in their eocketo s end the

          corners of his mouth lift with the idea of a smile..

                         27

          The motion of the room is sped to a blur until finally:

          BLACKNESS.

          A BLARING LIGHT comes out of the darkness. Morning sun

          streams through a window revealing Large's face, full frame,

          eyes still closed. Across his forehead in thick black marker

          the word "BALLS" is written.

          His eyes open wide. He has no idea where he is. His eyeballs

          swing left, then right. As Large site up

          THE CAMERA pulls back to reveal we are

          INT. MARK'S LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

          Large site on the sofa covered in an afghan. White morning

          sunlight pries past the beach towels covering the windows to

          highlight the duet in the air.

          A NOISE in the kitchen pops Large' s eyes open. He has no idea

          where he is.

          Large's POV into the kitchen reveals limited glimpses of a

          person walking around; like a hunter's amateur video of his

          Bigfoot sighting.

          He can only make out pieces: a sword, boots, then a cereal

          box.

          Then quickly the figure turns into perfect view: a medieval

          Knight in full regalia. They make eye contact for a second

          and Large slams his eyes shut. When he opens them again the

          knight is gone.

          INT. KITCHEN -- LATER

          Large and Mark sit with CAROL, mark's mother and TIN PAYTON,

          25. Carol is mid-forties and always looks like she's got a

          cold or has just been crying. Tim is dressed as a Medieval

          Knight.

          Large and mark stare at Tim as he SLURPS down his cereal.

          Carol smokes a thin cigarette. Mark is shirtless. No one

          addresses the fact that it says "Balls" in black marker On

          Large's forehead.

          Silence but for the CLANKING of SILVERWARE and TIM'S

          SLURPING.

                         CAROL

          it's good isn't it.

          No one responds, so Tim nods to be nice.

                         CAROL (CONT'D)

          i always try to save a couple of

          marshmallows for the very end, but

          I can never make it.

                         2B

          My mind wanders and I'm left with

          flakes and pink milk. And yet each

          time I pour a bowl I tell myself

          that this time, this is gonna be

          the time I'm gonna save at least

          one.

                         LARGE

          So, Tim, how long you been working

          at medieval Times?

                         TIM

          Three years. But I've only been a

          knight for two. You have to pay

          your dues. I worked in the stables

          and helped in the kitchen.

                         CAROL

          When I started he was making the

          coleslaw. It hasn't been the same

          since you got knighted.

                         TIM

          I really just stirred it.

                         CAROL

          Don't be modest. Mr. Modesty won

          the joust last night.

                         LARGE

          Congratulations.

                         TIM

          It's not that big a deal, it's

          fixed.

                         LARGE

          What was it that happened to you in

          high school? You had a thing, but

          I forgot what it was.

                         MARK

          He got the shit kicked out of him.

                         CAROL

          No he didn't.

                         MARK

          How do you know? He got the shit

          kicked out of him by Tyrell

          Freedmen.

                         LARGE

          I remember that. That was sofucked

          up. Why did he do that?

                         TIM

          I fucked him up too.

                         29

                         MARK

          He knocked your teeth out.

                         TIM

          He said I bit off him 'cause I got

          the same Jordans.

                         CAROL

          What?

                         LARGE

          That's right.

                         CAROL

          Who?

                         TIM

          Tyrell said I bit off him 'cause I

          got the same Jordans he did. But

          his were the red ones and mine were

          all white.

                         MARX

          Yours were red too by the time he

          was done with you.

          Everybody laughs but Tim.

                         MARK (CONT'D)

          Air bloody tooth.

                         (BEAT)

          So what are those, like fake teeth

          you got now?

                         TIM

          He only chipped one tooth. So what

          are you up to now, Mark, digging

          graves?

          Silence. A SPOON CLANKS on a plate.

                         CAROL

          Mark's getting into real estate.

           Silence. Mark FLICKS open his Zippo lighter and lights a

          cigarette.

                          CAROL (CONT'D)

          Tim can speak Klingon.

          What the fuck is Klingon?

          Like the Star. Trek guys?

                         CAROL

          Yup. He can talk in their language.

                         TIM

          She's kidding.

                         CAROL

          No, I'm not. He's being shy. Are

          you being shy?

                         MARK

          Don't be shy, Tim.

                         LARGE

          Yeah let's hear it, man?

                         TIM

          It's just made up. The guy who

          plays the wizard at work is a

          Trekky. I don't really...

                         CAROL

          He's being shy. Say what you said

          to me last night.

                         TIM

          No.

                         MARS

          Yeah, Tim. Say what you said to her

          last night.

          Silence. Everyone stares at Tim.

                         TIM

          I gotta get going anyway.

                         MARK

          Say what you said to her last

                         TIM

          Kuntar peteeky maya. Al fook soo.

          They all stare at him. Then burst out laughing.

                         MARK

          You've got to be kidding me.

                         CAROL

          It means, "I like to mate after

          battle."

          That's not what I said.

                         CAROL

          Yes.

                         TIM

          No, that wasn't the one I said.

          This one means "kill Kirk" and also

          'hallelujah" depending on the

          context.

                         MARK

          You must have gotten it confused

          with "Pleej artulyah. Hagtooth

          Theylaugh.

                         CAROL

          That was good, honey.

                         MARK

          You know what that means, Tim?

                         TIM

          No I don't know the whole language,

          I just...

                         MARK

          well I do. It means get the fuck

          out of my house before I chop your

          fuckin' head off.

          Silence. Large stares at Mark in disbelief, then starts to

          LAUGH. They all start to join him except Mark. They stop

          laughing.

                         CAROL

          Mark, he's a knight.

                         MARK

          He's just a fast-food knight.

                         TIM

          I should get going anyway.

          He gets up to leave. But his sword gets caught between his

          chair and the table. They all watch as he fumbles to undo

          himself. He's like John Ritter at his finest. Large and Mark

          just laugh.

                         TIM (CONT'D)

          Thanks for the cereal. By the way,

          it says "balls" on your face.

          Carol follows Tim out. Large slides to the microwave door's

          reflection.

                         CUT TO:

          IT. MARK'S LIVING ROOM -- LATER

          Mark and Large sit captivated by ALLIGATORS EATING ZEBRAS on

          TV. Large's forehead is now merely smeared with black ink.

          Mark leans forward to pull a bong hit from a blackened,

          colored tube. He coughs out his hit and reclines his bare

          back against the torn pleather couch. Carol enters and stands

          next to them watching the TV.

                         CAROL

          What's this?

          She finds a long, thin cigarette with lipstick on it in the

          ashtray and lights it.

                         MARX

          What the fuck is that shit, Mom?

                         CAROL

          Don't bring those fucking people

          here anymore, Mom. Or I'm leaving.

          I'm serious. No Medieval Times

          people in this house.

          He passes the bong to his Mom. She smokes it, then sits down,

          forcing them both to slide over. Several cats surround her_

          Then I could retire and we could

          Hi, I'm Andrew bargeman. I'm sorry.

          i'mn a little late for my

          appointment.

          She looks at her watch.

                         RECEPTIONIST

                         (SLIGHT ACCENT)

          okay, Andrew. I'm going to need you

          to fill out this paperwork for me,

          and we'll call you when we're ready

          for you.

                         LARGE

          Okay, thanks. Sorry.

                         35

          He site back down and begins filling out the form-

          The door opens and a blind woman with a seeing eye-dog

          enters. The Receptionist sees her and calls out:

                         RECEPTIONIST

          Hi Mrs. Lubin.

          MRS. LUBIN

          Oh, hello there.

                         RECEPTIONIST

          Just have a seat and we'll be with

          you soon.

          MRS. LUBIN

          Thank you.

          She site. Large turns back to his paperwork. He fills out a

          line before he notices the "seeing-eye-dog" has wandered over

          to him. Large looks at him.

                         LARGE

          (cold, disinterested)

          Hi, how are you?

          The dog looks both ways before mounting Large's leg and

          proceeds to thrust his groin to and fro.

          Large tries to shove him off. He looks back at the blind

          woman who stares off in the other direction. Large is about

          to say something to her but he stops himself.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)

          (under his breath)

          Get off. Off.

          The dog thrusts away.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)

                         (TIGHT WHISPER)

          Stop it. Heel. No thrust.

           Finally Large gives up and decides to just let it hump away-

           He tries to return to his paperwork. Someone BURSTS OUT

          LAUGHING. Large turns to see a cute 20 year old GIRL he

          hadn't seen sitting in the corner. She wears really big

          headphones.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)

          Got any suggestions?

                         GIRL

          Ready for me?

                         36

          The girl and Large look to each other, the receptionist is

          gone.

          Not yet Mrs. Lubin.

          The dog humps away.

          The girl comes over and sits one seat away from Large.

                         GIRL (CONT'D)

                         (SOFTLY)

          Kick his balls.

                         LARGE

          I don't want to hurt him.

                         GIRL

          It's the only way to teach them. I

          have three Dobermans. If I didn't

          kick them in the balls regularly

          I'd never get anything done.

                         LARGE

          Yeah, but I don't want to like

          destroy future generations of

          charitable dogs. Besides he's got

          to be close to finishing by now.

                         GIRL

          Not yet, here comes the lipstick.

          They sit and watch him go.

                         GIRL (CONT'D)

          Oh, he's gonna be sore tomorrow.

          WIDE SIDE ANGLE ON: the whole waiting room. Everything still

          but the dog's thrusting pelvis.

          Okay. C'mon Arthur.

          Arthur immediately responds to her voice and returns to her

          side to lead her into the office.

          No.

          That's cool. Great job, man. You

          were- I mean I thought you were

          really retarded. You were just as

          good as that corky kid and he's

          really retarded. I mean if there's

          some kind of like retarded Emmy you

          could win. You'd kick Corky's ass.

          thank you for... that.

          Oh, okay. Right on. My cousin's an

          actor. Jake Ryan Winters. I doubt

          you'd know him. He was on "Sheena"

          once as some gnome or something. I

          think that's great though.

          that speech to the whole stadium

          and your Dad gives you the thumbs

          No. Not right now I'm just...

          Any other retarded roles? I'm sure

          those.

          No, I'm just auditioning and.,.

                         SAM

          I can't believe you're not really

          retarded. Jake's not a very good

          actor. I mean on "Sheens" you

          couldn't really tell 'cause he was

          in a hairy gnome suit, but he used

          to put on these really low-budge

          renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber

          musicals in our attic when we were

          kids and they were awful. It sucks

          work for little people, you know?

          Anyway sorry I talk too much, fill

          out your forms.

          INT. NEUROLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY

          Large site alone in a barren office. He pans around the room

          staring at all the diplomas. His eyes follow them up from the

          base-board all the way up to the ceiling to reveal: there's

          actually one on the ceiling. The doctor enters.

                         DOCTOR

          intense headaches. They only last

          almost like a surge of electricity

          and then it's gone.

          He looks at the chart.

                         DOCTOR

          You're Gideon's kid. I didn't even

                         LARGE

          Well I think I've had them in some

          form since I was a little kid. But

          they've been getting more and more

          frequent over the last year.

                         DOCTOR

          (looking at chart)

          How long have you been on the

          Lithium?

                         LARGE

          Oh uh, I've been on some form of it

          since I was ten or so.

                         DOCTOR

          And what about Paxil, Zoloft,

          Celexa, Depakote; did any of that

          ever help you?

                         LARGE

          No. I mean I don't know. It's

          recently occurred to me that I

          might not even have a problem. only

          I'd never know it, because as far

          back as I can remember I've been

          medicated. I grew up on it. I left

          them in LA. This is the first time

          I haven't had it in my body since I

          can remember.

                         DOCTOR

          Well it'll leave your body pretty

          fast. I'll write you a

          prescription.

                         LARGE

          Actually I. was thinking about

          taking a little vacation.

                         A 42

                         DOCTOR

          Have you spoken to your

          psychiatrist about that?

                         LARGE

          E)h well, my psychiatrist is my Dad.

          So uh... he... I think he'd prefer

          me to stay on it. He likes to think

          it makes me happy. And I let him

          think that because he's sort of

          consumed by the idea of making

          everyone happy.

                         DOCTOR

          Well look, I'll examine you and

          give you a Catscan just so you

          won't worry that it's anything

          serious. But to be honest, I think

          the headaches are something else.

          Our bodies do very funny things

          when they're consumed with stress

          and anxiety. Things you'd never

          expect. I found my ex-best friend's

          cuff links in my wife's puree and I

          couldn't get an erection for a year

          and a half.

                         (BEAT)

          For example.

                         LARGE

          But that doesn't really feel like

          it. I mean I don't feel stressed or

          really anxious at all.

                         DOCTOR

          Well with all the Lithium he's had

          you on it's amazing you can even

          hear me right now_

                         LARGE

          Oh, right.

                         DOCTOR

          First of all, I do think you need

          to find a psychiatrist that isn't

          your father. That just's something

          that should have been remedied

          years ago. He knows better.

          Secondly, I'm not in a position to

          comment on whether or not you

          should stay on the meds or not; I

          don't know your story. But my

          opinion, since you're paying for

          it, is that those drugs may help as

          a means to an end. But if you're

          not In any sort of therapy, sooner

          or later what's ever going on in

          your mind will find a way to peek

          it's little head out of the water.

          you.

          AN OVERHEAD SHOT OF: Large staring at the wall as he lies on

          a white slab covered from the waist down by a white towel.

          AN OLD FEMALE NURSE straps him to the slab ignoring the

          OBSCENE WORDS and DRAWINGS in black marker that cover his

          chest.

          THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN to reveal Large and the slab being

          sucked.into the Catscan tunnel.

          EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY

          Large drives out of the parking lot. There, seated at the bus

          stop is Sam bobbing her head to music- She wears a backpack

          and holds an odd looking helmet in her hand.

          He pulls up alongside her.

                         LARGE

          Why were you really there?

                         SAM

          Charging. I'm a robot.

                         LARGE

          Do you lie a lot?

                         SAN

          What do you consider a lot?

                         LARGE

          Enough for people to call you a

          liar.

                         SAM

          People call me lots of things.

                         LARGE

          Is one of them "liar"?

                         SAM

          I could say "no", but how will you

          know I'm not lying.

                         LARGE

          Because I`ll choose to trust YOU.

                         SAM

          You can do that?

                         99

                         LARGE

          I can try.

          Who's bike is this?

                         LARGE

          It was my grandfather's. It was the

          only thing he left to anyone in my

          family and he left it to me. And I

          like it.

                         SAM

          This is the point where you ask me

          if I'd like a ride home?

                         LARGE

          It is?

                         SAM

          Yup.

                         LARGE

          Would you like a ride home?

                         SAM

          Fine, but I ' m not getting in that

          sidecar,

                         LARGE

          Why not?

                         SAM

          Sidecars are for bitches. Anyone

          who gets in that thing is

          automatically your bitch. Thus, I

          will ride on the back.

          She climbs on the back behind him.

          What are you like... a hanglider?

                         SAM

          I thought my boyfriend was gonna

          pick me up on his bike, so I

          brought it... But then he couldn't

          so...

                         LARGE

          So what, it's like one of those

          tandem things?

                         45

                         SAM

          No, its a Ninja. Way faster than

          this thing.

                         LARGE

          But what kind of helmet is that?

                         SAM

          You can use it on a motorcycle.

          Anyway, how's your head?

                         LARGE

          I should live through the day.

                         SAM

          Cool. Make a right here.

          They stop at a light.

                         LARGE

          Are you doing anything right now?

                         SAM

          Can you elaborate on "doing

          anything"?

                         LARGE

          Well, I just had this idea. I

          promised this guy I'd stop by his

          house that's right up here, but I

          don't really wanna stay very long.

          So I was just thinking if you came

          with me I could say I have to take

          you home when I'm ready to go.

                         SAM

          Wow. well that's pretty damn random

          of ya, Andrew.

                         LARGE

          I know.

                         SAM

          'Nice to meet you. May I use you?'

          That's the Hollywood in ya I guess.

                         LARGE

          No, it's not like that, c'mon.

          It'll be fun. I promise.

                         (BEAT)

          I'll tell you what. We'll have like

          a signal. When you pull on your ear

          that's the code and then I'll say,,

          "Well I've got to get her home

          now." And then we'll go.

          She mulls it over.

                         SAM

          Can we have code names too?

                         LARGE

          If you'd like.

                         SAM

          okay. But don't try and like

          kidnap me or anything, because my

          step-uncle's a bounty hunter and I

          could have you tracked and killed.

          The light changes and they drive off.

          EXT. JESSE'S MANSION'S FRONT YARD - DAY

          The poorly maintained backyard of a mansion: pools,

          fountains. Jesse stands shirtless and unshaven holding an

          enormous bow and arrow aimed at the sky. The end of the arrow

          is on fire. A joint hangs from his lips. Sam and Large look

          terrified.

                         JESSE

          'Kay ready?

          He unleashes the arrow into the air and the three of them

          scramble around in terror trying to avoid wherever it will

          land. It plunges into the earth three feet from Sam's foot.

          Frozen, she yanks on her ear; hard.

          house.

          I'll be fine. Am I the first boy

          you've ever brought home?

                         (YES)

          No. But I lied about my boyfriend

          driving a t.inja.

                         LARGE

          He doesn't drive a bike?

                         SAM

          No, I don't have a boyfriend.

                         (BEAT)

          He might drive a bike; wherever he

          is.

          Well we're off to a great start.

                         SAM

          okay so sometimes I lie. I'm weird,

          man. About random stuff too; and I

          don't even know why I do it. It's

          like a tick. I swear, sometimes I

          hear myself say something and then

          I think: "Wow, that's not even

          remotely true.

                         LARGE

          So how am I supposed to know what's

          real?

                         SAM

          Well, I always feel bad and admit

          them when they're lies.

          So, Titembay.

                         SAM

          Yeah, he's my brother.

                         LARGE

          Is he adopted?

                         SAM

          Well kind of. My mom adopted him

          years ago from Sally Strothers. one

          of those: For the cost of a cup of

          coffee a day" kind of things.

          where she's like, "How can you sit

          there and not help the children?"

          And we just couldn't. We couldn't

          sit there and not help those

          children. So we sent him letters

          and pictures for years and then I

          got really into ice skating and we

          kind of forgot about'em. Then one

          day the phone rang and it was

          Titembay and he was at the dry

          cleaners around the corner and he

          said that he was going to school at

          Rutgers and living in the dorms,

          but since he was used to living

          with his tribe he'd much rather

          live with his family.

          Yeah and he's been here ever since.

          He's an amazing guy, you gotta hear

          some of his stories. I mean this

          guy struggled through so much

          because he wanted to learn. I think

          of what he's accomplished and I

          just feel so lazy. He's studying

          criminal justice at Rutgers right

          now and when he was a baby he was

          one of those kids with flies all

          over his face.

                         LARGE

          Wow. I mean that's great. It's a

          That, my friend, is a true story.

          I'm not that good-

          A pause. Sam sits on the bed. THE AWESOKE MUSIC PLAYS. She

          breaks the moment by pulling a small tattered piece of satin

          fabric off the bed.

          SAM (CO13T'D)

          This is Tickle.

          What is Tickle?

                         SAM

          The Wailing Wall. It's like the

          most holy place for Jews to go and

          was destroyed by the Romans.

          anything Jewish. I don't go to

          temple or anything. But I don't

          know any Jews who go to temple. The

          Jews I know only go on Yom Kippur.

          One day; the day of repentance. Did

          you know that most temples are

          designed with movable walls so that

          on the one day of the year when

          a everyone comes to repent they can

          actually make the room big enough

          to hold everyone?

          you're whole life lusting for

          anything you don't have. You stress

          over money and your career, you set

          your clocks back, you exercise, you

          wait in line, you paint your house,

          get depressed, feel better, buy

          things, take your clothes to the

          dry cleaner, set your clocks

          forward and spend your whole life

          waiting for happiness to arrive in

          the mail. Then you die and people

          are really sad, they cry really

          hard...

                         (BEAT)

          and then they go eat lunch.

          Oh please be a little more

          interesting than that.

                         60

          Please don't be the brooding guy.

          That's so unoriginal. I'd rather

          hold onto who I imagined you'd

          become.

          Miss me?

                         CYNTHIA

          No. Me?

                         LARGE

          No.

                         (BEAT)

          She didn't like being alive. She

          got what she wanted. This should be

          a party. Instead we're supposed to

          mope. About what? She never did

          anything.

                         CYNTHIA

          She made you.

                         LARGE

          some trophy. I do have to say I'm

          impressed with the turnout.

                         CYNTHIA

          What, you didn't think people would

          come?

                         LARGE

          Seems to me the only thing more

          depressing than a funeral is a

          funeral where no one shows up.

          Don't you ever think about who'll

          show up to yours?

                         CYNTHIA

          No. Right now I'm alive, so I think

          about living.

                         LARGE

          It's one way to determine who your

          friends are. The people who'd show

          up at my funeral if it was held in

          their state, that's one level of

          friend. But my real friends, the

          people who really love me, they'd

          come if it was on the other side of

          the country.

                         CYNTHIA

          So where do I fall into that?

                         LARGE

          You'd be there.

                         CYNTHIA

          Oh you think so?

                         61

                         LARGE

          I do. I think you'd show up because

          the truth is, that you really did

          miss met you always thought of me

          as the brother you never had. But

          you've got too much pride to let me

          know that. You want to pout 'cause

          I don't return your calls.

                         CYNTHIA

          you're way more talkative than I

          remember.

                         LARGE

          Today I've been more talkative than

          I remember.

                         CYNTHIA

          What about mine?

                         LARGE

          Funeral? Honestly? I probably

          wouldn't travel for it- no. But

          don't worry, I'm sure you'll have a

          great turnout.

                         CYNTHIA

          Why do you say that?

                         LARGE

          'Cause there's also the guy who

          lives his life to insure a good

          turnout. I think that's how my Dad

          lives his-, like he's sort of

          writing his own eulogy as he goes

          and making life choices dependent

          on how it will sound in a speech.

                         CYNTHIA

          Are you implying that that's why

          I'm going to med school or

          something?

                         LARGE

          I'm just saying a lot of people -

          not necessarily you - a lot of

          people try and accumulate accolades

          that will somehow justify their

          lives.

                         CYNTHIA

          It's said we spend ninety-five

          percent of our lives trying to look

          good.

                         LARGE

          Where do I sign up for not caring?

                         62

                         CYNTHIA

          How about sucking it up and really

          having it out with your Dad? That

          would be a tremendous step towards

          not needing to look good.

                         LARGE

          Wow, that was so clever how you did

          that. Is he grooming you to be a

          psychiatrist too? Med school's one

          thing, but please don't become him.

                         CYNTHIA

          He's one of the most caring people

          I've ever met.

                         LARGE

          well you would say that; you're the

          son and daughter he never had.

          Hell, you're the family he never

          had. Has he got you on Lithium

          yet? Wait till he does, you'll love

          him even more.

          He stands.

                         CYNTHIA

          I bet my Mom a dollar you were

          coming home with a message. I said

          after nine years, he's definitely

          coming home with a message.

                         LARGE

          i looked for a message; I got bored

          and became an actor.

          He leaves.

          INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

          Large enters the kitchen where JANICE, 50's, Cynthia's Mom,

          is doing the dishes. He walks over to the counter near the

          sink and just stares off across the room. She dries her hands

          and moves to Large. She opens her arms. After a beat he steps

          into her embrace. He rests his head on her shoulder and

          closes his eyes. Neither says a word.

          FADE TO BLACK:

          LARGE'S BEDROOM -- MORNING

          Morning sun blasts the entire room. Large site on the edge of

          his bed squinting at pictures:

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

          Large peeks his head around the doorway.

                         63

                         LARGE

          Hello?

          Dad?

          After shutting the door behind himself he' crosses to the

          dresser and lifts one perfume bottle out from a dozen. He

          smells the nozzle then brings the bottle with him as he edges

          towards...

          INT. MASTER BATHROOM --- CONTINUOUS

          The bathroom is stark white. A large Jacuzzi tub sits at the

          far end of the room. The faucet drips.

          THE MOUTH OF THE FAUCET

          as it wells with water and overflows to DRIP onto the drain.

          Large crosses to the tub and tries to tighten the faucet to

          stop it from dripping. It continues to DRIP. He stares at the

          empty tub.

          GIDEON (O.S.)

          Hi.

          Large jumps around and puts his hand to his chest.

                         LARGE

          Holy shit, you scared the shit out

          of me.

          awful in there though. It's by no

          means as good a bathroom as this

          one is. This one is- well we redid

          Look, I wanted to ask you... I mean

          if you don't want to talk about

          this its perfectly fine, but I'm

          just...

                         GIDEON

          No I can. I know. I figured you

          would want to...

                         LARGE

          But we don't have to do it now. I

          mean you don't have to do that now.

          It's just at some point I would...

          I have some questions.

                         GIDEON

          I knew that you would.

          Silence.

                         GIDEON (CONT'D)

          Occasionally she would hum.., your

          Mother. Always the same tune and I

          never knew what the song was. I

          don't even know if it was a song or

          if she just made it up - It's funny

          because it always struck me as so

          out of character for her and every

          time she did it... I just always

          liked it. But I never told her I

          could hear her because I knew if I

          ever did she would stop.

                         (BEAT)

          She took a bath every night. And

          she was always very quiet.

                         65

          The only thing I would ever hear

          when I'm in the bedroom was a

          little splashing of water when she

          was moving around. And every now

          and then, her humming.

                         (BEAT)

          so anyway, then usually she would

          call me when she was done, so I

          could come and help her out. But

          this time, that night... she never

          called. And I just figured she was

          taking a longer bath or something,

          but when I called out to her, she

          didn't answer. So then I uh... When

          I came in, she was there.

                         LARGE

          So she didn't yell or...

                         GIDEON

          No. I didn't hear anything. The TV

          was on pretty loud. I always watch

          the weather report before I go to

          sleep.

                         LARGE

          It's just weird.

                         GIDEON

          What?

                         LARGE

          I don't know, it's just that you'd

          think if someone was really

          drowning to death they would

          scream. I mean really scream from

          the terror of it all, you know?

          They would splash and scream I

          would think; I would have thought.

                         GIDEON

          I would have too, but no. Nothing.

          (off Large's look)

          What?

                         LARGE

          Don't take this the wrong way.

                         GIDEON

          What ?

                         LARGE

          I'm not reading into this, I'm just

          What? No.

                         LARGE

          What?

                         66

                         GIDEON

          Its not that.

                         LARGE

          I'm just saying did they check? I

          mean has someone ruled that out?

                         GIDEON

          No. Because they know she drowned,

          Andrew.

                         LARGE

          I'm just saying the facts.

          No.

                         LARGE

          And I suppose it doesn't even

          really matter. But I'd be curious

          to know. I would like to know if

          that's what happened; just for me.

          I mean would that surprise you?

                         GIDEON

          No. Yee!

                         LARGE

          She made it very clear to everyone

          she knew that nothing was ever

          going to make her happy-

                         GIDEON

          I know! Do you think I don't know?!

                         LARGE

          And c'mon let's be honest; she

          tried it before.

                         GIDEON

          Shut-up! .lust shut your fucking

          mouth.

          Large is taken aback.

                         (FIGHTING TEARS)

          If nothing else will you please

          just leave, her alone. She's gone.

          That's it. That's all you get. She

          died. We will never see her again.

          She tried very hard, but she just

          couldn't find it. She could never

          find it. And I think - I know that

          she's found it now. I know that.

          And I know there's a certain amount

          of guilt that you must feel for the

          way things unfolded, but it's too

          late now.

          that.

                         LARGE

          Does that make it easier for you?

          Tears stream down Gideon's face, He sits down on the toilet

          and cries.

                         GIDEON (CONT'D)

          A giant rusted yellow tractor sits parked by an open grave-

          Large and Jesse lean against opposite tombstones facing each

          other.

          Mark stands in the open grave STEALING VALUABLES FROM AN OPEN

          COFFIN. A small PILE OF JEWELRY sits beside the grave.

                         MARK

          How could you leave all that

          Lithium? I was totally gonna hit

          you up for some.

                         FB

                         JESSE

          This fuckin' guy. I'm glad you're

          back, man, because this town is so

          messed up. Everyone's got there

          drug of choice like in "Brave New

          World". Did you ever read that

          book? Who wrote that? Aldous

          something. Aldous-

                         LARGE

          I don't know.

          Jesse continues talking, but his voice distorts into WARBLED

                         NONSENSE AS

          SLOW MOTION: LARGE STARES in shock as Mark drops a WEDDING

          RING into the PILE OF JEWELRY he's stealing off the corpse.

          MARK LOOKS UP AT LARGE STARING AT HIM AND HIS LOOT. THEY HOLD

          EYE CONTACT FOR AN UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENT. Large breaks it and

          looks away.

                         REGULAR MOTION:

          JESSE (O.S.)

          .and people are just like that

          here, man. Huxtable3 Aldous

          Huxtable. That's it.

          INT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

          Sam and Large are looking through a photo album. Olivia

          enters with an enormous Parrot on her shoulder.

                         OLIVIA

          Andrew would you like to see Sam's

          ice skating tape?

                         SAM

          Mom, no.

                         LARGE

          Absolutely.

                         OLIVIA

          She was so ahead of her time. She

          could have gone to the Olympics.

                         SAM

          No, I couldn't have.

                         OLIVIA

          Yes, you could have. Don't blame it

          on the epilepsy, you had a gift.

          Large looks to Sam, but she avoids eye contact with him-

                         LARGE

          C'mon let me see it.

                         69

                         OLIVIA

          Let's just show him the "Florida

          Stars of the Ice" opening; the

          Gator costume.

                         SAM

          Mom. I'm asking you seriously.

                         LARGE

          Don't be shy. Just let me see it.

                         OLIVIA

          Oh, she wants you to see it. How

          could you not want him to see how

          talented you are?

                         SAM

          Were.

          They cross to the TV room where they find Titembay wearing

          rubber gloves, seated next to an open tool box, dusting the

          coffee table for fingerprints and referring to an open text

          book. White powder reveals fingerprints (and pawprints)

          everywhere, including the TV screen.

                         OLIVIA

          Honey what are you doing?

                         TITEMBAY

          I'm dusting for prints.

                         OLIVIA

          Well do you think we could move the

          crime scene to the kitchen? I want

          to show Andrew Sam skating.

                         TITEMHAY

          But someone's been pissing on my

          Gamecube and I'm about to close the

          case.

                         OLIVIA

          It wasn't me your honor.

                         TITEMBAY

          The pawprints point to a canine.

                         OLIVIA

          Andrew come sit down here next to

          me.

          Large sits next to Olivia on the couch between snoring

          Dobermans. He places his glass of water on the table. Sam

          stands in the doorway.

                         SAM

          I can't believe you're showing him

          this.

                         0

                         70

          THE SHAKY, AMATEUR VIDEO comes up on the screen: a person in

          a full alligator costume wearing white gloves skates onto the

          ice. The lights come down except for a spotlight on the

          alligator.

                         OLIVIA

          There she is.

                         LARGE

          You're the alligator?

                         OLIVIA

          You can tell by the hands.

          The alligator skates in and out of the white fingerprints on

          the TV screen to classical music. We begin to see that Sam is

          a talented skater. In a very odd way, it's beautiful.

                         TITEMBAY

          Here comes the Double Axle...

                         OLIVIA

          And... land! I mean come on. Isn't

          she good?

          Large, Titembay and Olivia APPLAUD. As they do, the LIGHTS in

          the room SWITCH ON and OFF. Titembay CLAPS twice to turn them

          back on.

                         OLIVIA (CONT'D

                         LARGE

                         SAM

                         LARGE

          That was so good. You're Mom's

          right you were amazing.

          Titembay has begun brushing white powder on Large's water

          glass revealing his fingerprints.

                         SAM

          Okay this was great, but we have to

          go now.

                         OLIVIA

          All right, well I just wanted to

          show you how talented she is. My

          baby.

                         SAM

          Mom.

                         A

                         A 1

                         OLIVIA

          Okay get out of here. Wait, Give me

          a hug.

          Sam crosses to her mom. They hug.

                         OLIVIA (CONT'D)

          I love you so much. I'm so proud of

          you.

                         SAM

          I love you too.

          Olivia kisses Sam on her forehead.

                         OLIVIA

          Okay, have a good night.

          She pats Sam's butt as she walks toward the door.

                         LARGE

          Bye. Thank you so much for dinner.

                         OLIVIA

          C'mon, you're giving me a hug too.

                         SAM

          Mom.

                         LARGE

          I'll take a hug.

          They embrace.

                         SAM

          Okay, good-night.

          (calling to Titembay)

          Night, Tim.

                         LARGE

          Good-Night.

           TITEMBAY (0.5.)

           Rolla!

          INT. BAR -- NIGHT

           Sam and Large sit in a booth of a local Irish pub drinki ng

           pints. They're buzzed.

                         LARGE

          It was the only thing I ever really

          liked doing; pretending to be

          someone else.

                         (BEAT)

          But I've been so out of it the only

          parts I ever get offered are to

          play handicapped people.

                         72

          She tries to hold it together, but she bursts out laughing.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)

          It's not funny.

                         SAM

          Oh c'mon. Don't ya see that it's a

          joke. If you can't laugh at

          yourself life's gonna seem a lot

          longer than you'd like.

                         LARGE

          So what should we laugh at you

          about?

                         SAM

          I lied again. I have epilepsy.

                         LARGE

          Which part are we laughing about?

                         SAM

          I had a seizure in the law office

          where I work and they said their

          insurance would only cover me if I

          wore "preventative covering".

                         LARGE

          Preventative covering?

                         SAM

          The helmet I was carrying.

          Large is silent.

          SAM (CONT' D)

          Oh come on, that's funny. I'm the

          only person in the world wearing a

          helmet to work who isn't putting

          out fires or racing for NASCAR. But

          what do you do? I can't quit; their

          insurance is amazing. What can you

          do? You laugh. I'm not saying I

          don't cry a lot, but in between I

          laugh and realize how silly taking

          anything very seriously is. And

          plus, I look forward to a good cry.

          I just love the way it feels.

                         LARGE

          I haven't cried since I was a

          little kid. I didn't cry at my

          mother's funeral. I wanted to-

                         (A SMILE)

          I... tried. I thought of all the

          saddest things I could think of;

          things in movies, this image from

          Life magazine that haunts me...

          nothing came.

                         (MORE)

                         73

          That actually made me sadder than

          anything; the fact that I felt no

          numb.

                         SAM

          What do you mean?

          MARK (O. S.)

          Vagina!

                         LARGE

          Oh, no.

          Mark, Dave and Jesse appear with some others.

                         LARGE "(CONT'D)

          Hey, guys, this is Sam. This is

          Mark, Dave and you met Jesse.

                         MARK

          Hey. Nice to meet you.

                         JESSE

          Hey.

                         DAVE

          T'sup.

                         MARK

          I'm sorry I yelled- 'vagina' just

          now, I didn't see you.

                         SAM

          It's okay.

                         MARK

          Nice. Let's get fucked up.

          Off Large's smile we:

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. JESSE'S POOL -- NIGHT

          A palatial swimming pool in the backyard of Jesse's mans ion.

          The Manhattan skyline twinkles far in the distance.

          Large, Sam, Mark, Dave, Jesse and a couple of high school

          girls from the bar stand in their underwear on the edge of

          the pool.

                         MARK

          One, two, three!

          Everyone jumps into the pool SCREAMING except for Large. He

          stands there staring at the water.

                         SAM

          Hey! what are you doing?

                         74

                         DAVE

          Largeman, get the fuck in the pool.

                         GIRL

          oh, it's so warm!

                         SAM

          Can you swim?

                         LARGE

          'Course I can swim.

          JUMP CUT TO. Large in the shallow-end doing the most pathetic

          doggy paddle you've ever seen. Everyone stares in disbelief.

                         JESSE

          Dude maybe you should stay on the

          steps; I don't know CPR.

                         MARK

          You look like a drunken beaver.

          They all laugh- Sam swims over to him sitting on the steps.

          She smiles at him.

                         LARGE

          (in a whisper)

          I never learned how to swim.

                         SAM

          Fooled me. I thought you just had a

          cramp.

                         (BEAT)

          Or two.

          He smiles.

                         SAM (CONT'D)

          (in a whisper)

          I can't whistle if it makes you

          feel any better.

                         LARGE

          There's a handful of normal kid

          things I kinda missed.

                         SAM

          There's a handful of normal kid

          things I kinda wish I'd missed.

          She floats on her back beside him.

                         SAM (CONT'D)

          So how long are you gonna stay

          here?

                         LARGE

          Probably till my fingers get

          wrinkly.

                         75

                         SAM

          (with a laugh)

          No, I mean in Jersey.

                         LARGE

          Oh. I think I'll probably head home

          the day after tomorrow. well, LA.

          That's not my home.

          Rer smile fades.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)

          You know that point in your life

          when you realize that the home you

          grew up in isn't really your home

          anymore? And all of a sudden, even

          though you have a place where you

          put your Shit, the idea of "home',

          is gone.

                         SAM

          I still feel at home in my house.

                         LARGE

          You'll gee when you move out. It

          just kind of happens one day and

          it's gone. And you feel like you

          can never get it back. it's like

          you feel homesick for a place that

          doesn't even exist. But maybe it's

          like this rite of passage, you

          know? And you won't ever have that

          feeling again until you create a

          A new idea of "home" for yourself,

          for the family you start, for your

          kids. It's like this cycle.

                         (BEAT)

          Maybe that's all a family really

          is; a group of people who miss the

          same imaginary place.

          They hold eye contact. The SPLASH of a CANNONBALL swings

          their gaze to the others horsing around in the deep end. Sam

          leans her head over and rests it on his shoulder.

                         SAM

          Maybe.

          INT. JESSE'S MANSION: LIVING ROOM -- LATER

          An enormous and desolate LIVING ROOM devoid of any furniture

          or decoration. Mark, Jesse, Sam and Large sit huddled under

          towels at the foot of a colossal fire place that houses a

          small blaze. They eat potato chips and drink canned beer.

          They are all pretty tipsy. Mark plays with a "Silent Velcro"

          sample.

                         MARK

          How 'bout some fucking furniture

          dude.

                         76

                         JESSE

          I bought a chair but I didn't like

          it.

                         SAM

          Where is it?

                         JESSE

          Its keeping us warm.

                         MARK

          Silent Velcro. Lucky motherfucker.

          Large and Sam follow Mark down a corridor and into a vending

          machine room. He opens a door labeled "Private" into a

          kitchen area. They weave through the kitchen down another

          hall...

          INT. BACK ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

          They arrive at a locked door. Mark knocks.

          After a beat it's opened by an Asian teenager with bad acne

          blasting his walkman. The far wall is entirely covered with a

          blown-up mural of a New Jersey Driver's License used for

          making fake ID's. The space where the face would go is

          missing, revealing an opening in the wall. They climb

          through.

          INT. SECRET HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

          DURING THE FOLLOWING SCENE, THE CHARACTERS WILL ONLY WHISPER

          IN EACH OTHER'S EARS. WE WILL ONLY KNOW WHAT THEY ' RE SAYING

          FROM SUBTITLES.

          They squeeze down a long dark corridor filled with graffiti.

          They come upon a young teen staring through a peep hole in

          the wall. Mark taps him on the shoulder. He turns his head

          and nods in recognition.

          When he pulls away from the peep hole, the LIGHT PROJECTS THE

          IMAGE OF THE MOTEL ROOM ON HIS FACE .

                         94

          (Yes, that really happens.) As he looks at Mark, Sam and

          Large, his forehead is filled with the image of a BUSINESS

          MAN brushing his teeth. Mark leans into his ear.

                         MARK

                         (SUBTITLED)

          Where's Diego?

                         TEEN

                         (SUBTITLED)

          Down the hall. There's a hooker in

          room 112.. It's crazy down there. I

          figured I'd just chill with this.

          SLOW MOTION: Mark gestures for Large and Sam to follow him

          down the hall. The hall is strewn with young men staring

          into peep holes. As Mark, Sam and Large pass them, the

          Peeping Tom's each turn to see who it is.

          As they turn, each one has the image of what they're watching

          projected on their face. We hear the ECHOES of the SOUNDS

          FROM the ROOMS.

          -- An old couple slow dancing projected on another teen.

          REGULAR MOTION: They arrive at the end of the hall where a

          group of six young guys are glued to the image being

          projected onto the wall opposite the peep hole. An old camera

          lens has been ducked taped to the peep hole causing the image

          to appear in perfect focus.

          The projection shows a very hot, YOUNG HOOKER getting taken

          from behind by an OLDER GREASEBALL. Her face is no more than

          three feet from the peep hole. The HOOKER'S MUFFLED MOANING

          can be heard from the other side of the wall.

          Everyone's eyes are glued to the wall. Large notices one kid

          has duct tape over his mouth, while another is sweating

          profusely. Sam's jaw is dropped open.

          GRBASESALL (0.5.)

          I'm fucking you! I'm fucking you.

          Large notices another kid lip-synching along with the

          Greaseball. Mark spots DIEGO, a Hispanic guy, 32, wearing a

          bell-hop uniform and gestures him closer.

                         MARK

                         (SUBTITLED)

          T'sup dog? She's fuckin' hot.

                         DIEGO

                         (SUBTITLED)

          This is the most exciting day of my

          life. We've never had anything

          close to this.

                         MARK

          I've got that Nitrous tank for you,

          so can I get that info?

                         A

                         95

                         DIEGO

          You're gonna have to wait a couple.

          The HOOKER MOANS.

          GREASEBALL (O.S.)

          Who's fuckin' you? Hub? Who's

          fuckin' you?

          The Lip-Synching Kid mouths, "You are."

                         MARK

          Dude we're kind of in a rush.

                         DIEGO

          You can wait, he's about to cunt.

                         GREASEBALL

          I'm gonna fucking cum!

          Diegogestures, "Told you."

                         HOOKER

          Cum on my back!

          The group responds in silent shock. Jaws drop, Diego grabs

          his hair with his fists. Just as they are about to climax, we

                         CUT TO:

          INT. OUTER ROOM --- DAY

          Mark, Diego, Large, Sam and others rush out into the outer

          room.They speak in quiet whispers.

                         DIEGO

                         HOLY SHIT3

                         MARK

          Wow.

                         DIEGO

          That shit was hot! I got to go drop

          some knowledge on that ho.

                         SAM

          How do you know she's a hooker?

                         DIEGO

          of course she's a fucking hooker.

          Girls that look like her do not

          fuck guys that look like him unless

          it's for money, coke or fame.

                         SAM

          Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett.

                         DIEGO

          Who the fuck are you?

                         96

                         MARX

          Oh, this is Sam and Large.

                         DIEGO

          No offense.

                         (TO MARK)

          Why are you bringing these people

          here?

                         MARK

          He's the guy who needs that thing.

          Look I brought you the tank, so can

          you just tell us where to go now?

                         DIEGO

          Tank come with balloons?

                         MARX

          Am I a fucking birthday clown,

          Diego? No I don't have balloons.

          Suck it off the tap. And I need it

          back when you're done; the guy's

          holding my thirty-nine bucks.

                         DIEGO

          All right. Hold-up. Who here just

          saw some titties?!

          They all stare.

                         DIEGO (CONT'D)

          Raise your hand if you just saw

          some titties?!

          They all raise their hands. (Including Sam.)

                         DIEGO (CONT'D)

          Thank you. So everybody needs to

          calm the fuck down.

                         MARK

          we're in a hurry.

                         DIEGO

          All right. You know where Kiernan's

          Quarry is?

          EXT. KIERNAN'S QUARRY -- LATER

          They pull up on the motorcycle.

          MARK (V . O . )

          Down in Newark, right?

          DIEGO (V.0.)

          Yeah, its at the bottom of

          Hillside and Rivington.

          You can't really see it from the

          street, but it's there. Park your

          car at the gate and hop the fence.

          They do.

          DIEGO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          At the bottom of the quarry there's

          this Junkyard run by this guy named

          Albert. lie's the one that tracked

          down the piece you're looking for.

          I'll call him right now and tell

          him to expect you.

                         LARGE

          Okay, stop. What the fuck are we

          doing?

                         MARX

          Just be patient.

                         LARGE

          Dude, we've been patient all day,

          but it's my last day in town and

          you haven't told me what the fuck

          we're doing. I mean if you told me

          we were going on a six hour

          scavenger hunt for blow I would

          have passed.

                         MARK

          Blow? Please. If I was gonna give

          you coke we'd have gone to the high

          school football practice and we'd a

          been reeling five hours ago.

                         LARGE

          Well I think we've corrupted this

          innocent girl enough for one

          afternoon.

                         SAM

          I'm not innocent.

                         LARGE

          (getting worked up)

          Yes, you are. And that's what I

          like about you. And I don't want

          this fucking guy taking you to the

          bottom of a quarry in a sketchy-ass

          neighborhood to find some Pitbull's

          raping each other or... crack

          whore's huffing turpentine or

          whatever it is that you have us

                         DOINGS

                         MARK

          Wow. That's the most worked up I've

          ever seen you.

                         98

                         SAM

          He was protecting me.

                         LARGE

          So.

                         SAM

          He likes me.

                         LARGE

          Don't be cute.

                         SAM

          You're my knight in shining armor.

                         LARGE

          Don't talk about knights in front

          of Mark. It's a sore subject.

                         MARK

          I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

                         LARGE

          Pun intended?

          Beat as Mark gets it. He comes after him.

                         MARK

          You're dead.

          They play wrestle as Sam watches.

          EXT. KIERNAN'S QUARRY -- MOMENTS LATER

          The three of them reach the top of a small hill to reveal...

          AN ENORMOUS ABANDONED QUARRY

          Colossal old cranes and construction trucks loom in the

          distance like ancient dinosaurs frozen in rust and graffiti.

          The center of the quarry goes so deep they can't see the

          bottom. They stand on the edge. Rain clouds rapidly drift

          overhead. This glace is surreal.

                         SAM

          Wow.

                         LARGE

          I never even knew this was here.

                         MARK

          I've heard about it. They were

          supposed to build a mall here I

          think.

                         SAM

          Yeah I remember reading about it in

          the paper.

                         A

                         99

          They were digging one day and they

          broke through into this like

          natural phenomenon. It's like an

          underground Grand Canyon or

          something. So now they're in some

          huge legal battle over whether they

          can build here or not.

                         LARGE

          Can you imagine the guy who's job

          it is to fight for the right to

          build his mall on some like

          geological phenomenon?

                         MARK

          They love their mall's here man.

          Okay let's just find this guy and

          get outta here.

                         LARGE

          You're not gonna tell us what we're

          getting?

                         MARK

          It's a surprise, you'll see.

          Mark walks on ahead of them down a path that winds down

          alongside the abyss.

          EXT. 1CTERNIAN'S QUARRY -- LATER

          Further down the path. Sam looks to Large. He uses an old mop

          handle he's found as a walking stick.

          As they continue along the path it begins to get continually

          cluttered with rusty junk. An old bedframe, a porcelain tub,

          remnants of a "Jungle-Gym", dirty broken toys.

          Further along down the path amidst the junk they see a THIRTY

          FOOT DILAPIDATED SOUSE BOAT perched on cement blocks that

          sits right on the edge of the cliff. It's windows glow warm

          and welcoming.

          Mark stands in front of the boat. This isn't what he

          expected. Rain begins to fall.

                         MARK

          I guess this is it.

                         LARGE

          So... knock. Knock and barter for

          "Dessert Storm Trading Cards".

                         MARY

          Please don't tease me about my

          hobbies. I don't tease you about

          being an asshole.

          They stand in the pouring rain staring at the boat. Mark

          steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull.

                         100

          After a moment, ALBERT, a very gentle looking man in his mid-

          thirties with a newborn baby asleep on his shoulder appears

          on the deck. He smiles warmly-

                         ALBERT

          (in a whisper)

          Mark?

                         MARK

          Yeah. Are you Albert?

                         ALBERT

          (with a smile)

          Yes. Come on in out of the rain.

          Sam and Large look at each other, then follow Mark up an A-

          frame ladder that sits next to the hull.

          INT. ALBERT'S BOAT -- CONTINUOUS

          They step inside and the door closes behind them. It's very

          cozy and warm. GREAT MUSIC PLAYS. A wood burning stove heats

          the room and throws warm amber light onto a small LIVING ROOM

          with deep cushy couches.

                         ALBERT

          You guys must be freezing. Make

          yourselves warm by the fire. I'm

          just gonna go put her down. I'll be

          right out.

          The three of them huddle by the fire. They speak in quiet

          whispers.

                         SAM

          I must say, I've been continually

          impressed today with how each new

          place you bring us manages to be

          weirder and weirder.

                         MARK

          What do you mean, this is nice.

                         LARGE

          ah nothing, just hanging out in an

          old boat at the bottom of a quarry

          in Newark.

                         MARK

          It's hardly the bottom, dude. Did

          you see that cliff?

          Albert returns with FAYE, an equally gentle and caring

          looking woman in her early thirties.

                         ALBERT

          This is my wife, Faye.

          This is Mark and Sam and Large,

          right?

                         MARK

                         YEAH_

                         ALBERT

          Diego told me when he called.

          Please have a seat, make yourselves

          comfortable.

                         FAYE

          Its really coming down out there,

          huh?

                         LARGE

          Yeah, it just started pouring all

          of a sudden.

                         ALBERT

          Well in a bad storm I like to

          pretend this old boat's my own

          private "ark". Unfortunately, if

          this is the apocalypse, I'm not

          quite sure it still floats.

                         FAYE

          Would any of you like some tea?

                         SAM

          I'd love some tea.

          Large and Mark look at her.

                         LARGE

          No thanks.

                         MARX

          No.. thanks.

          Faye crosses to a small kitchen. They all sit there politely

          nodding at each other.

                         LARGE

          What is it that you do here? What

          is this place?

                         ALBERT

          Good question. We're calling it

          Kiernan's Fault. And no one's

          really quite sure what it is

          because they haven't been able to

          explore it. They're locked in a

          legal battle over who has the

          rights to the land.

          So one of these days it will either

          be a national park or a shopping

          mall. But while their locked in

          litigation, I was hired to make

          sure no one comes inside.

                         LARGE

          Oh. Wow.

                         ALBERT

          What they don't know is that I'm a

          geologist working undercover for

          the preservation lobby. So, at

          night... I go down.

                         FAYE

          He's documenting it to support

          their case.

                         SAM

          Wow. So how deep does it go?

                         ALBERT

          No one really knows. I've been in

          the furthest and that was about two

          miles down. But I like to pretend

          it's infinite.

                         11

          Faye brings them tea.

                         SAM

          It's kind of an odd job isn't it?

          Guardian of an infinite abyss?

                         ALBERT

          Yeah, I guess it is. We also trade

          and deal in antique jewelry. I

          suppose it's pretty odd for you that

          we live down here like this-

                         SAM

          No.

                         LARGE

          Not at all.

                         MARK

          Never crossed my mind.

                         ALBERT

          But we think it's important.

                         LARGE

          Why? What do you think you'll find?

                         ALBERT

          I don't know. It's exciting. New

          frontiers are hard to come by these

          days. I guess I just like the idea

          of discovering something.

                         (MORE)

                         103

          Doing something completely unique

          that no one's ever done before.

          Large looks to Sam.

                         LARGE

          Yeah. "Albert's Abyss".

                         ALBERT

          Who knows? Maybe. But I used to

          think that was all that mattered.

          No matter what it was, as long as I

          could put my name on it. Like it

          would somehow justify the fact that

          I lived; that I was here. "I did

          that. That's mine. I got this plate

          on my travels." But you know what?

          That's all ego; none of that stuff

          really matters. If at the end of

          the day I get to be with her, if I

          get to be with this person right

          here and the baby we created, then

          that's all I need. Just having

          felt that... If I die in an hour, I

          know I've lived.

          Faye kisses his forehead.

                         LARGE

          You know "my whole life I've had

          that same anxiety that if I didn't

          discover something or... save

          something or...

                         SAM

          Save something from being

          discovered.

                         LARGE

          Yeah. That I'll have somehow wasted

          my time here. And that somewhere,

          whatever force created us, would

          resent me for it.

                         ALBERT

          Well I think that force would

          rather remind you that "breathing's

          all it takes to be a miracle".

          He takes a deep breath. Large, Sam and mark stare at Albert;

          TRANSFIXED. He's like a sage.

          GREAT MUSIC BEGINS.

                         ALBERT

          Well i suppose you want what you

          came all the way down here for.

                         MARX

          Yeah, that would be great.

                         104

                         ALBERT

          It took me awhile to track this

          piece down. But I owe Diego huge.

          He pulls a small paper bag off the counter and hands it to

          Mark. Mark looks inside and nods his head.

                         MARK

          That's it. Thank you.

          They all stand.

                         SAM

          Well thank you for the tea.

                         LARGE

          Yeah, thanks.

                         FAYE

          Okay, good luck in the rain. Would

          you like some garbage bags or

          something?

                         LARGE

          Yeah, that would be great.

          EXT ALBERT'S HOUSE BOAT--DAY

          They open the door and venture into the, DOWN POUR in their

          garbage bag parkas.

                         ALBERT

          Good-bye.

          Albert stands with his arm around Faye in their warm doorway.

          As the three of them climb down the ladder and head up the

          path. Large turns back' around.

                         105

          THE GREAT MUSIC CONTINUES

          SLOW MOTION: Mark, Sam and Large in black garbage bag rain

          parkas head up the incline away from the trailer at half

          speed.

          Large leads them to an old yellow crane that's rusty arm

          hangs out over the 'edge. He climbs up onto it's base.

          REGULAR MOTION; Large SCREAMS as loud as he can, with

          everything he has, like he's emptying himself into the abyss.

          Sam and Mark look up at him and climb up alongside Large to

          join hint.

          The three of them, in their black parkas, with their hair

          drenched against their heads, SCREAM as loud as they can,

          with everything they have in the POURING RAIN.

          FREEZE FRAME: The three of them smiling. A release. A perfect

          moment.

          UNFREEZE: Sam locks eyes on Large. He stares back at her.

          They kiss. He wraps his hands around the back of her head and

          they kiss, in the pouring rain, on the edge of something.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MARK'S HOUSE -- LATER

          The rain has stopped as Large's motorcycle pulls up in front

          of Mark's house. mark gets out of the sidecar.

                         LARGE

          So I don't know if I'm gonna see

          you.

                         MARK

          I know. Don't you wanna know what's

          in the bag?

                         LARGE

          To be honest, I don't even care

          anymore.

          Mark pulls out the bag. It practically falls apart it's 80

          wet from the rain. He pulls out an ANTIQUE NECKLACE with a

          square pendant on it. He puts it in Large's wet hand.

                         MARK

          I'd be lying to ya if I told ya

          this was my plan all along.

          worth something, right?

          This whole day was about this?

                         (NODDING)

          And anyway you didn't want it down

          there with her. It's better for you

          to have it.

          Large shakes his head; he's shocked. Mark backs away, still

          wearing his garbage bag parka.

                         MARK (CONT'D)

          Hey, if you ever need a Kato, you

          know where to find me.

          Large sits back down on the bike into Sam's wet arms. He

          stares at the pendant in his hand.

                         SAM

          What is it?

                         LARGE

          It's my Mom's favorite necklace.

          FADE TO BLACK:

          INT. MASTER BATHROOM -- NIGHT

          They sit, soaked from the rain in the empty bath tub where

          Sarah Largeman drowned,, cross-legged facing each other.

          Large wears the necklace around his neck. He plays with the

          pendant...

          EXTREME CLOSE-UP INSIDE TEE PENDANT: It's an antique game

          where you try to get three tiny lead balls to sit in three

          separate indentations.

                         LARGE

          No. I don't want to play this game.

                         SAM

          Why not? I'm curious. She's sitting

          here, across from you and you can

          say anything at all. All the things

          you never got a chance to say.

          isn't that what you came home for?

                         LARGE

          Okay.

          if my mother were sitting here I

          would tell her...

          Silence. The faucet DRIPS behind him.

                         SAM

          What?

                         LARGE

          I really don't wanna...

                         (BEAT)

          I would tell her that I'm sorry.

                         (BEAT)

          I'm sorry that she wasn't happy.

          And I'm sorry I couldn't make her

          happy. And you know if I could have

          had anything I ever wanted to have

          happen in my life actually ever

          happen, it would have been that she

          would be happy. And...

          A tiny tear wells in his lid and. spills over.

                         SAM

          Oh, my God, Large I think I see

          one.

                         LARGE

          Shut-up.

                         SAM

          Yeah, I do. Don't move, we should

          save it or something.

          She finds a clear plastic cup.

          SAM (COUT' D)

          Here don't move, I'm gonna get it.

          She tries to coerce the- tear off his cheek into the cup, like

          a child capturing an inch worm.

                         LARGE

          I guess I could put it in my

          scrapbook, if I had a scrapbook.

          They wait.

                         SAM

          Is that it?

                         LARGE

          I think so. I don't feel any more

          coming.

                         SAM

          Well if you do, let me know and

          I'll grab the cup, okay?

                         108

                         LARGE

          Yeah.

                         SAM

          This was a good idea. Keep talking.

                         LARGE

          It's funny; this thing reminds me

          of this really random memory of my

          mother. Its so weird, I haven't

          thought about this in so long, but

          this great memory I have where I

          was a little kid and I was crying

          for one reason or another and she

          was kind of holding me and rocking

          me back and forth. And I could see

          the little balls in this thing just

          rolling back and forth. And there

          was just snot dripping down my

          nose.

                         (HE LAUGHS)

          And she just handed me her sleeve

          and told me to just blow my nose

          into it. And I remember thinking,

          even as a very little kid, "Wow.

          This is love."

          More tears start to well and overflow from his eyes. He tries

          to stifle them with a LAUGH. He cradles the pendant.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)

          This is love. And it just felt

          so... good to be there. So safe.

          And I didn't feel safe very often,

          but at that moment...

          Tears are now streaming down his face as well as Sam's. She

          holds the plastic cup in her hand.

                         SAM

          oh, Large I'm never gonna be able

          to get all these.

          They laugh. She moves closer, wrapping her legs around his

          waist to hug him close. She kisses his-'wet cheeks.

                         SAM (CONT'D)

          I'm never gonna be able to get all

          these, am I?

                         LARGE

          It's so funny isn't it? But I

          think that's the single most

          amazing moment I remember of my

          Mother. 'Cause she wasn't sad and

          she wasn't being prodded to be

          happy, she was just there.

                         SAM

          To be your Mom.

                         209

          He node and tightens his lips; trying to hold in the faucet

          that his eyes have become; a monumental release. He almost

          looks like a different person. They stare directly into each

          other's eyes. He turns away; it's too vulnerable a place for

          him.

                         SAM (CONT'D)

          Look at me.

                         (BEAT)

          Look at me.

          He does. And we see a vulnerable, lonely, little boy.

                         SAM (CONT'D)

          (in a whisper)

          Let go. Listen to me. Just don't

          hang onto any of it anymore. You're

          holding on so tight and you just...

          you don't have to hang onto any of

          it anymore. Just let it all go.

                         LARGE

                         (THROUGH TEARS)

          I just don't...

                         SAM

          Just let it all go.

          He cries with his elbow over his eyes.

                         SAM (CONT'D)

          What do you feel? Describe it. That

          always helps me. My mom always

          says, "What's the word that's

          burning in your chest..."

          She touches his chest with her hand.

                         SAM (CONT'D)

          What is it?

          He looks away. Soared.

                         SAM (CONT'D)

          Look at me.

          He does.

          you... God, you do. You've got so

          many years of it in you, pleading

          to come out.

          This fucking hurts.

          if nothing else...

          (pointing to his chest)

          That is life. St's real. And

          sometimes it burns. But maybe... it

          might be all there is.

          I'm your new friend, Sam.

          They both laugh; a release.

                         LARGE

          Fuck. I feel like I just get so

          much thrown at me; like there's so

          much speeding by me in a day that I

          feel like if I look up from the

          sidewalk, I'll get dizzy and fall

          down. So it's like I just...

          barrel through and don't look up,

          so I'll just never fall, you know?

          And that's really... and you know

          it's so sad to say this, but that's

          really how I've been living my

          whole life.

                         SAM

          Trying to barrel through.

          fall.

          Thanks Mom.

          (beat, realizing)

          That's funny. The definition's

          always confused me, but I'm pretty

          sure that's irony.

          Come here.

          She comes in for a tight embrace. He kisses her gently on her

          cheek with his eyes closed, then rests his head on her

          - shoulder.

                         SAM

          How do you feel?

          On Large's face as he thinks about that question.

                         LARGE

          Safe.

                         (BEAT)

          When I'm with you, I feel so

          safe... like I'm Rome.

          No, no, it's uh... I was just

          reading.

                         LARGE

          I've been on a pretty crazy little

          No, I just... maybe I have been.

          I'm sure you can find plenty of

          things in your life to be angry

          about, but what I don't understand

          is why you're so angry at me. All I

          ever wanted was for everybody to be

          happy again, Andrew. That's all I

          ever wanted.

          time that you have in your mind

          that you wish we could all get back

          to? 'Cause I don't have it in my

          memory. Maybe if I did I could help

          steer us back there. But we

          Well we might have a shot at it if

          you could just forgive yourself for

          what you did.

          for what I did right now: I was a

          little boy and somebody made a

          shitty latch. That's what I think

          now. And I'm not gonna... I mean

          I'm not gonna take all those drugs

          anymore. Because they've left me

          completely numb. I have felt so

          fucking numb to everything I have

          experienced in my life. And for

          that; I'm here to forgive you.

          Well maybe what Mom wanted more

          than anything, was for it to all be

          over. And for me, what I really

          want more than anything, is for it

          to be okay with you for me to feel

          something again; even if it's pain.

          Going against your doctor's

          recommendation; that's a pretty

          weighty experiment to take on don't

          This is my life, Dad. This is it.

          I don't think it's too much to take

          on. Because it's everything there

          give?

          HIS FINGERS as they slide down off the bathroom door frame.

          He backs away slowly to the bed and site down; staring

          blankly at the bathroom door. And then he starts to SOB.

          Quickly his whole body seems to surrender into it and he

          WEEPS hard. His whole back lurches upward with each SOH.

          RYAN (O.S.)
