          BLACK.

          SILENCE.

                          CARD 1

           AT 600 KM ABOVE PLANET EARTH THE

           TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATES BETWEEN 120 AND

           -100 DEGREES CELSIUS.

          SILENCE.

                          CARD 2

           THERE IS NOTHING TO CARRY SOUND, NO

           OXYGEN, AND NO AIR PRESSURE.

          SILENCE.

                          CARD 3

           LIFE HERE IS IMPOSSIBLE.

          SILENCE.

                         TITLE-

                          GRAVITY

                         BLACK-

          OUTER SPACE, 600 KILOMETERS ABOVE-

          PLANET EARTH.

          Like all images of Earth seen from space, this image of our

          planet is mythical and majestic.

          The globe seems almost tangible, slowly spinning, floating in

          the endless void of space. It is a blue planet, and bright white

          clouds twirl and stretch in capricious patterns across the deep

          blue of the oceans and the jigsaw of continents: green, yellow

          and brown.

          It is noon in Cape Town and early night in India.

          The sphere is almost a perfect orb except for the darkened

          sliver on its Eastern edge.

          It is beautiful! And so full of life.

          But not here.

          Here it is completely silent.

                         SILENCE-

          IN THE DISTANCE-

          A small metal object crosses the empty space surrounding Earth.

          If it appears to be a small satellite that is only because it is

          far away from us. It is the size of one football field. It is-

          The INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS).

          It resembles a dragonfly. Its solar panels stretch out, like

          wings, from the long body made of connected pressurized modules.

          It floats with a sense of proud achievement.

          It orbits at an altitude of 500 km above sea level. It moves at

          an average of 27,700 kilometers per hour, completing 15.7 laps

          around the Earth per day.

          It is cruising over Zimbabwe. To the East, the island of

          Madagascar. Up to the North, the expansive dry lands of Somalia

          and Ethiopia.

          Soon, the ISS curves around the spherical planet, and it becomes

          smaller, almost indistinguishable, no more than a small bright

          spec grazing over the blue atmosphere.

          CLOSER TO US-

          Orbiting at an altitude of 600 km-

          The EXPLORER SPACE SHUTTLE becomes visible.

          This icon of space exploration has played a key role in all of

          NASA's missions since the late 90's.

          Faintly we hear static, voices murmuring over radio frequences.

          As the babble bulds we might hear one conversation amongst the

                         REST:

          A fizz of static and then the voice continues with sudden,

           Are you feeling nauseous?

          An ASTRONAUT - MATT KOWALSKI - floats thirty meters away from

          the Shuttle wearing a bulky white space suit and a full, bubble-

          like helmet.

                          ASTRONAUT

           Houston, I have a bad feeling about

           this mission.

                          MISSION CONTROL

           Please expand.

                          MATT

           Okay, let me tell you a story. It was

           '96. I'd been up here 42 days. Every

           time I passed over Texas, I'd look

           down, knowing the second Mrs Kowalsky,

           was looking up, thinking of me. Six

           weeks I'm blowing kisses to that

           woman. Then we land at Edwards and I

           find out she'd run off with a lawyer

           before I was off the launch pad, so I

           packed my car and I headed to...

                          MISSION CONTROL

           Tijuana. You've told this story,

           Kowalsky. As Houston recalls, she

           took off in your '74 GTO. Engineering

           requests fuel status on the jet pack

           prototype.

          Matt smiles, checks the monitors of the sleek device strapped to

          his back.

                          MATT

           Five hours off the reservation and I

           show 30% drain. My compliments to

           Engineering. Except for a slight

           malfunction on the nulling of the roll

           axis, this jetpack is one prime piece

           of thrust.

                          MISSION CONTROL

                          (ON RADIO)

           Engineering says thank you.

                          MATT

           Tell them I still prefer my '67

           Corvette though. Speaking of which did

           I ever tell you the--

                          MISSION CONTROL

                          (ON RADIO)

           We know the Corvette story, Matt.

                          MATT

           Even Engineering?

                          MISSION CONTROL

           Especially engineering. We're going

           to miss you, Matt.

          Matt grins, fiddles with a control and propels himself away from

          the Shuttle.

          Stationed around the telescope are TWO ASTRONAUTS carrying out a

          repair mission. They are also wearing space suits but unlike

          Matt, they are not wearing Manned Maneuvering Units. SAFETY

          TETHERS are the only things stopping them from floating away

          into space.

          SHARIFF DASARI is an Indian engineer in his mid-thirties. He is

          attached with tethers to a platform on one side of the Hubble.

          This is his second mission into outer space.

           Indeterminate estimates make Houston

           anxious.

                          SHARIFF

           No... no... no Houston, don't be

           anxious. Anxiety is not good for the

           heart... The system is ready to re-

           activate.

           rest of the day off.

          Shariff cheers and begins singing a pop tune in Hindi, bursting

          into a Zero-G Bollywood choreography that is repressed by the

          stiffness of his space suit.

                          MATT

           He appears to be doing the Macarena of

           some sort. Though that would merely be

           a best guess scenario on my part.

          Matt is now approaching the Explorer, skillfully maneuvering his

          thrusters.

          The other astronaut stands perched on a ROBOTIC ARM attached to

          the Shuttle. The arm is a crane-like moving platform remotely

          operated from inside the Shuttle.

          We TRACK In on the astronaut as she works intently alone.

           Doctor Stone? Medical is asking if you

           want to return to Explorer?

          Ryan HUMS as she jiggles the CARD.

                          RYAN

           No, we've been here for a week

           Houston, let's just finish this.

          RYAN STONE is a medical engineer, specialized in hospital

          scanning systems. She's focused on her work as though she's all

          alone in the world. This is her first mission.

          Ryan eyes the Card, then...

           RYAN (CONT'D (CONT'D)

           Card is up.

                          (ON RADIO)

           That's a negative. I'm afraid we're

           getting nothing on this end, doctor.

          Ryan eyes the Card, then...

                          RYAN

           Try again.

                          MISSION CONTROL

           (a beat, then...)

           Still nothing.

                          RYAN

           Thank you, Kowalsky.

          Ryan moves the Card around.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Now, Houston?

                          MISSION CONTROL

           Negative.

                          (ON RADIO)

           We're not receiving any data.

           Engineering is recommending a vis-

           check for component damage.

          Again, as if to herself-

                          RYAN

           Mmmm. Let me see what's going on.

          She starts to disengage one of the panels.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

                          (MUMBLES)

           What have you got here?

          Ryan takes out a card from under the plate and begins to examine

          it. Matt begins to approach her.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Visual examination doesn't reveal any

           damaged components. The problem must

           be originating in the comms panel.

                          MISSION CONTROL

                          (ON RADIO)

           That seems to be the case. Engineering

           admits that you warned us that this

           could happen. That's as close to an

           apology as you're going to get from

           them. We should've listened to you

           doc.

          Without losing any time, Ryan puts the card back into the

                         TELESCOPE-

                          RYAN

           I'm on it.

                          (ON RADIO)

           Copy that. How long do you think it'll

           take you?

          Matt begins a wide loop around the telescope.

                          RYAN

           An hour.

                          MISSION CONTROL

                          (ON RADIO)

           Outstanding. We appreciate your

           patience, Doctor. Installing your

           system in the Hubble is the main

           purpose of this mission.

          Ryan doesn't respond, continuing to work. Matt closes in as he

          circles the telescope.

           MISSION CONTROL (CONT'D)

           Houston trusts Mission Commander

           not of sufficient duration to enable

           him to surpass Anatoly's Solovyev's

           spacewalking record, as most recent

           Mind if I join the fun?

                          RYAN

           Certainly.

          Ryan begins unbolting. Matt lands right next to Ryan and grabs

          onto the telescope. She is frustrated, determined.

                          MATT

           How are you feeling?

                          RYAN

           Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble

           dried.

          Matt takes out his pistol grip, and with fast precision puts its

          head to a bolt and begins unscrewing. Matt removes the bolt

          with confidence.

                          MATT

           It's been a rough week. If it makes

           you feel any better, I puked up

           everything but my kidneys on my first

           ride.

          Ryan is not as precise with her pistol grip, and when a bolt

                         COMES OFF-

          She DROPS IT.

                          RYAN

           Whoa...! AWOL!

          The bolt spins floating away. She tries to grab it but MISSES,

          barely touching it but brushing it just enough to give it a push

          that makes it change direction....

          She turns and reaches out to grab it, but she is strapped to the

          Robotic Arm.

          The bolt spins out into the emptiness of space when-

          A hand GRABS it before it has gone too far. It is Matt's.

          Ryan looks at him, embarrassed.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Thanks. Sorry. In my basement lab

           things usually fall to the floor.

          Matt puts the bolt away. He begins to unscrew another bolt.

                          MATT

           Hey -- you're the genius up here. I

           just drive this bus.

                          RYAN

           Call me a genius if I can get this

           board initialized in the next hour.

                          MISSION CONTROL

           Explorer, this is Houston.

                          EXPLORER CAP

           Go ahead Houston.

                          MISSION CONTROL

           NORAD reports a satellite has incurred

           a missile strike. The impact has

           created a cloud of debris orbiting at

           20,000 miles per hour. Current debris

           orbit does not overlap with your

           trajectory. We'll keep you posted on

           any developments.

          Ryan glances at Matt.

                          RYAN

           Should we be worried?

                          MATT

           Let the boys down there worry for us.

           Standby for arm maneuver.

          The robotic arm moves very slowly, pulling Ryan along while Matt

          begins to unharness from the telescope to shift his position.

                          MATT

           So doc, now that you work for NASA,

           how do you like it?

                          SHARIFF

           Kinda like winning the lottery, isn't

           it?

          She grins at the memory, glances at him. Confesses:

                          RYAN

           I was just happy that they didn't cut

           the funding to my research.

                          MATT

           How long was your training?

                          RYAN

           Six months.

                          SHARIFF

           Including holidays?

                          MATT

           So, what is this scanning system?

                          SHARIFF

           Nothing rad, it's just a new set of

           eyes to scan the universe.

                          RYAN

           Assuming it works, it's just for

           hospital use. This one is a prototype.

                          EXPLORER CAP

           Standby for marking.

                          MATT

           Listen, they don't bankroll

           prototypes, even for your pretty blue

           eyes.

          She gives him a look.

                          RYAN

           My eyes are brown.

          Matt stares at her, a faint smile on his face.

                          MATT

           Right now your eyes are blood shut.

          She grins, looks away -- he got her. Then...

                          SHARIFF

           Kowalsky!

          Matt turns. Shariff raises his arms again.

                          SHARIFF (CONT'D)

           Is this great or what?!

          Shariff JUMPS and FLOATS AWAY from the Shuttle, screaming and

          flapping his arms. A long SAFETY TETHER attached to his waist

                         TENSES AND-

          Brings Shariff to an ABRUPT STOP, snapping him back like a

          bungee cord.

                          MATT

           (for Ryan's benefit)

           And to think he went to Harvard.

          Ryan doesn't react to this, too consumed as she is with the

          panel. Matt looks out. A sad smile is on his face.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           You gotta admit one thing. You can't

           beat the view....

          MATT ENJOYS THE VIEW

          THE EARTH, with its ever-changing surface of blues and whites,

          greens and browns, is massive and serene below him.

                          RYAN

           Mm-hm.

                          MATT

           "Mmm?" So what do you like about being

           up here?

          She hesitates -- trying sincerely to articulate her feelings as

          we GAZE down at the silent planet below.

                          RYAN

           The silence.

                          (BEAT)

           I could get used to it.

          Matt laughs softly.

          We arrive back on him as he turns back to look at Earth.

          Something flickers briefly in Matt's eyes-- something

                         COMPLICATED--

                          MATT

           Hmmmm. Terrific.

          Ryan inspects a panel inside the telescope, studying it with a

          small mirror.

                          RYAN

           Houston, from first inspection comms

           panel appears to be dead. Am I a go

           to cut link to auxiliary?

                          MISSION CONTROL

           You're the expert, doctor. It's your

           call.

          Ryan takes out the small mirror and Matt stretches his arm,

          offering assistance, but-

          She does not want any help and puts the mirror away in her

          toolbox, leaving Matt with his arm outstretched.

          Ryan starts looking for another tool, but Matt is one move ahead

          of her, offering her a pair of tweezers.

          Ryan hesitates and takes the tool. She starts working on the

          panel.

                          MATT

           Houston, I have a bad feeling about

           this mission.

                          MISSION CONTROL

           Please elaborate.

                          MATT

           It's the same feeling I had at Mardi

           Gras in 1987...?

          He waits, letting the moment hang knowingly. Then:

                          MISSION CONTROL

           That is affirmative. Surprisingly,

           control hasn't heard the Mardi Gras

           story. Please proceed.

                          MATT

           Well, it's day one and I'm bumping my

           way down Bourbon Street looking for

           the sister of a friend of mine. The

           streets are swimming with people, I'm

           thinking there's no way I'm finding

           this girl...

          Ryan rolls her eyes and mumbles to herself-

                          RYAN

           Proceeding to over ride.

          Matt continues his story without missing a beat-

                          MATT

           Then all of a sudden I look up and --

           there she is.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           I am about to yell out when I notice

           she's holding hands with a short hairy

           guy in board shorts and a

           realize, the guy's no guy. My sister's

           Debris from the impact has caused a

          She keeps on furiously tweaking.

                          MATT

           I'm not going to ask you again.

                          RYAN

           Sorry. I'm sorry. It's done.

          The ROBOTIC ARM slowly withdraws, carrying Ryan back towards the

                          MISSION CONTROL

           We have a full on chain reaction. It's

          Shariff arrives to the base of the telescope.

                          SHARIFF

           They shot down their own satellite?

                          MATT

           Right of disposal. Most likely a spy

           sat gone bad. Now it's space junk.

          Matt grabs onto the base of the telescope-

           What's the blowback, Houston?

                          MISSION CONTROL

           It's not good. Most of our systems are

           going down. Debris chain reaction is

           out of control and rapidly expanding.

           Multiple sats are now down and they

           keep on falling.

          Matt eyes the arm as it slowly retracts, carrying Ryan back.

                          MATT

           Define "multiple" sats.

                          MISSION CONTROL

          The satellite EXPLODES into hundreds of pieces and-

          A CHAIN REACTION takes place.

           We have to go. Go, go! Go!

          The DEBRIS from the BSE satellite hits the WEATHER SATELLITE,

           Houston, this is Explorer. Copy?

          Still no answer.

           EXPLORER CAP (CONT'D)

                          (ON RADIO)

           We lost Houston!

          Matt stops next to Ryan.

                          MATT

           Unstrap! You can't tune out the world

           up here.

          She reaches for the last clip and begins to undo it.

                          RYAN

           I'm trying...

                          MATT

           Try releasing the safety clip.

          Shariff makes his way back toward the airlock as-

          A PIECE of the debris HITS the Hubble's SOLAR PANELS, making a

          12-inch HOLE in its golden surface.

          A piece of debris passes, nearly hitting them.

                          SHARIFF

           Need some help there Matt?

                          MATT

           No, don't wait for us. Get inside.

                          RYAN

           It's stuck!

          Further back, another piece of debris collides with a bigger

          one. The two chunks of debris explode into a million pieces of

          shrapnel, one of which-

          HITS Shariff's helmet, breaking through the glass and hitting

          his head like an expansive bullet.

                          MATT

           Man down! Man down!

          Matt PROPELS himself toward Shariff, who is floating away from

          the Shuttle unconscious.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

                          (TO RYAN)

           Disengage!!!

          AN IMPACT.

          A piece of debris pierces through the right wing of the Space

          Shuttle, creating a five-foot hole.

          THE SPACE SHUTTLE ROLLS.

          The arm, with Ryan attached to it, rolls with the Shuttle.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Explorer has been hit. Explorer do you

           read? Explorer, over. Explorer--

          Another IMPACT.

          A piece of debris HITS the robotic arm like a cannon ball and

          DETACHES it from the Shuttle.

          The broken piece of the arm SPINS AWAY from the Explorer at a

          great speed with Ryan attached to it. She passes next to-

          THE HUBBLE as a big piece of debris hits the telescope. The top

          of the cylinder explodes into more debris, which is expelled in

          all directions, barely missing Ryan as she spins away attached

          to the arm.

          ON THE ARM-

          Ryan's panic grows as she spins further into the nothingness of

          space.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Astronaut off structure! Dr. Stone is

           off structure!

          With every spin, the shuttle, being punished by debris,

          diminishes into a tiny dot in the distance.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

                          (ON RADIO)

           Dr. Stone, detach!

                          RYAN

           Nooooo!

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           You must detach!

                          RYAN

           No.

                          MATT

           If you don't detach that arm is going

           to carry you too far!

                          RYAN

                          (FROZEN)

           I can't!

                          MATT

           (a brief beat, then)

           Listen to my voice. You need to focus.

           I'm losing visual of you. In a few

           seconds I won't be able to track you.

                          RYAN

           (She pulls herself together)

           Ok. Ok.

                          MATT

           You need to detach. I can't see you

           anymore.

          The robotic arm keeps on spinning and stars orbit wildly in her

          field of vision.

                          RYAN

           I'm trying. I'm trying.

                          MATT

           Do it. Now!

                          RYAN

           Ok. I'm trying! I can't it's stuck,

           Hold on.

          Ryan's hands are trembling and she can't get a grip on the hook.

                          MATT

           Houston, I've lost visual of Dr.

           Stone... Houston, I've lost visual of

           Dr. Stone.

          As Matt's VOICE is LOST to STATIC, Ryan squeezes the hook and

          is...

          ...gone, kicking herself AWAY from the robotic arm and FLYING

          FREE of the rotating arm. She catches a brief glimpse of the arm

          as it helicopters away, then loses sight of it as she rotates

          end over end in endless free fall.

          A PRIMAL SCREAM of God forsaken fear erupts from her lungs.

          The RADIO CRACKLES and Matt's VOICE returns.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Dr. Stone! Do you copy?! Repeat! Do

           you copy?

                          RYAN

           Yes. Yes. I copy. I'm detached!

          Ryan slowly spins, drifting into the empty darkness of space.

                          MATT

           ...Give me your position!

                          RYAN

           I don't know. I don't know! I'm

           spinning. I can't. I can't.

                          MATT

           Report your position.

          Tumbling end over end, Ryan fixes her gaze on her wrist. The

          effort makes her nauseous. She looks away.

                          RYAN

           GPS is...down. I can't, it's down, I

           can't.

                          MATT

           Give me a visual.

          Matt's faint voice is heard on the transmission under a lot of

          static. Ryan is panicking and begins to hyperventilate. Her eyes

          rake the dark sameness of her surroundings.

                          RYAN

           I told you! Nothing. I see nothing!

                          MATT

           Do you have a visual of Explorer?

                          RYAN

                          NO--

                          MATT

           Do you have a visual of ISS?

                          RYAN

                          NO--

          As Matt's signal grows fainter her breathing becomes more

          labored.

                          MATT

           I need you to focus. Give me a

           visual... anything.

          Ryan's eyes flutter, then roll up into her sockets...

                          RYAN

           It's too fast.

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

          Ryan swallows harshly, her throat suddenly dry.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           I can't breathe. I can't...breathe...

          She inhales and exhales with quick short breaths-

          AHHHH... OHHHH

          AHHHH... OHHHH

          Ryan's eyes are wide open and desperate as her breathing

          accelerates.

          AHH... OHH... AHH... OHH

          AHH... OHH... AHH... OHH

          Her limbs look fragile against the black and incalculable void.

          AHH... OHH... AHH... OHH

          She inhales.

          AHH...

          And her throat closes.

          HH...

          Her mouth is open, but she cannot exhale.

          Not a breath.

          Ryan's choking. The lack of oxygen is making her veins pop out

          and her lips turn blue.

          Her eyes open wide, and-

          She exhales.

          OHH...

          And begins breathing deeply.

          AHHHHHH... OHHHHHH....

          As her breathing steadies, she begins to focus, her eyes

          searching the distance.

          THROUGH THE HELMET-

          Ryan can see her face reflected against the visor, lit by the

          control panels.

          She dims the light and she can see-

          Her legs and arms floating against endless space as she drifts

          towards the empty void, broken only by lonesome stars whose

          position change as she rotates, giving way to-

          THE EARTH,

          Very still and very distant. Night is creeping across the sphere

          as the sun sets, a sliver of light on the Western Hemisphere.

          A metallic object floating over the Earth is hit by a RAY of the

          sinking sun, and it gleams like a tiny star. Her eyes blink in

          recognition, gleaming with alertness.

          Her intellect engages and she gains a new sense of calm.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Houston, this is Dr. Ryan Stone.. I'm

           drifting but I have a visual of

           Explorer.

          Her eyes scan the enveloping darkness, trying to get a fix on

          the gleaming orb that is earth, her face alive with

          concentration as she makes calculations.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           With North at 12 o'clock, the Shuttle

           is at the center of the dial.

          She frowns as she tumbles backward again, recalculating.

          The sun is slipping behind the Earth. She studies the rim of

          fire until it too slides from view.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           I can see the Chinese station. No, no,

           no, it's the International Space

           Station.

          The sun's glow illuminates another object in the distance, a

          bright spec hovering over the horizon- the INTERNATIONAL SPACE

          STATION.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           ISS is at 6, no, 7 o'clock.

          Just then, the sun's rays recede and the Station DIMS, becoming

          one with the darkness. Ryan blinks, mildly alarmed.

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Lieutenant Kowalsky, do you copy?

          Silence.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Explorer, do you copy?

          Silence.

          Slowly, the sun recedes further behind the earth and the light

          bathing Ryan's face evaporates. As she is swallowed by the

          darkness, she speaks once again:

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Houston, do you copy?

          THE WHOLE FACE OF THE EARTH IS IN SHADOW.

          And so is Ryan. Her eyes dart. It is utterly silent. She spins

          in the darkness, waiting.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Houston, this is Mission Specialist

           Ryan Stone. I'm off structure and I'm

           drifting.

          There is only the silence, complete and absolute.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Do you copy?

          Nothing. She watches the earth slip from view yet again.

          When next she speaks, the words are as delicate as snowflakes,

          tripping off her tongue like a prayer...

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Anybody...? Anyone...? Please copy.

          A soothing light hits Ryan's face.

          THE MOON is rising over the Pacific Ocean.

          It's almost full and its soft cool light pours over the globe,

          brightening the deep blue waters and-

          IN THE DISTANCE -

          A LIGHT, not bigger than a star, is FLICKERING.

          Ryan's eyes focus on the light. Her PUPILS DILATE. Something

          like tears glistens as she stares at the flickering light,

          afraid to blink as she watches the...

          ...star draw closer, smiling as the faintest thread of a radio

          transmission stitches its way through the silence, listening as

          STATIC SINGS through her helmet, stinging her ears with the

          sound of...

          Her name.

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           ... Stone. Do you copy?

                          RYAN

           (almost to herself)

           Lieutenant Kowalsky?...

          The flickering star begins to thicken...

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           Repeat. Do you copy?

                          RYAN

           YES! YES! I copy! I'm here!

          As she watches the figure of an astronaut takes shape.

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           Flash your light.

                          RYAN

           My light?

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           So I can see you.

                          RYAN

           Here! Here!

          Ryan opens a pouch in her suit, fishes out a FLASHLIGHT. Hands

          trembling she shines it toward the approaching dot.

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           There you are. Hang tight. Report

           your status.

                          RYAN

           I'm... I'm alright... I'm fine.

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           Your status! Give me your readings?

                          RYAN

           3.6 psi, I think.

                          MATT

           Your O2. Give me your O2.

                          RYAN

           Steady at eight percent...no seven...

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           You're breathing too fast. You're

           burning oxygen. We don't want to do

           that. We want to relax. Copy.

                          RYAN

           Copy.

                          MATT

           Nearly there.

                          RYAN

           Please hurry.

          Ryan can see Matt quickly growing in size. She continues to

          FLASH HER LIGHT.

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           You can holster that torch, Dr. Stone.

                          RYAN

           Oh. Sorry.

          She slips the light back into her side pouch just as Matt

          appears as if from nowhere and GRABS HER.

                          MATT

           Gotcha.

                          RYAN

           Arghh!

          Ryan holds on to Matt. Instantly, they begin to spin together.

          Matt takes out a tether.

                          MATT

           Now, I'm going to tether you to me.

          Ryan is paralyzed, holding onto Matt tightly and looking at him

          in fright. He stares back.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           I know. You never realized how

           devastatingly good-looking I am.

          Matt grins.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           But I need you to stop staring and

           help me with the tether. Okay?

                          RYAN

           Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, Ohh I got it.

          He runs the other end of the tether to the harness on Ryan's

          suit and attaches it.

                          MATT

           Ok. So far so good. Now listen. I'm

           going to give you a little push, just

           so you're clear of the jets--

                          RYAN

                          NO--

                          MATT

           Sorry. Not a push, more like a nudge.

                          RYAN

           No... No... No... Wait... Don't.

          Matt places his hand on her breastplate and gives her a gentle

          nudge. Drifting again she begins to freak.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Nooooooo!!!! Dammit!!!

          The tether tenses and she stops nine feet away from Matt.

          Matt ignites the thrusters, tugging Ryan behind him. But this

          proves a difficult endeavor as her momentum drags him, changing

          his direction.

                          MATT

           See? Where you go, I go.

          Matt ignites a new thrust to re-direct his position. As he does

          so Ryan's change of momentum makes him swing again.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Better. Let's get out of here.

          Using his thrusters, Matt negotiates a new position and,

          igniting a long thrust, he jets away.

          Ryan cannot repress the anger boiling up, and SHE SCREAMS-

                          RYAN

           Ahh Dammit!

                          MATT

           I know what you mean.

                          RYAN

           Ahhh Dammit.

                          MATT

           You're burning oxygen, we're going to

           go back to the shuttle. How's that for

           a plan. Copy?

                          RYAN

                          FUCK

                          MATT

           Right copy that.

          As Matt accelerates toward a lower orbit, his momentum takes

          over, steadying Ryan's swing.

           MATT (CONT"D) (CONT'D)

           Houston in the blind, this is

           Kowalsky. Dr Stone and I are making

           our way to base, please prepare

           Airlock for arrival. Copy?

          They descend, gliding through pieces of debris. Among the space

          junk, a Solar Panel from the Hubble is distinguished.

          Matt eyes a small dot in the distance: the Shuttle.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Houston this is Kowalsky. How do you

           copy?

                          RYAN

           Why aren't they answering?

                          MATT

           It seems like communications are lost.

                          RYAN

           Can they hear us on an alternate

           frequency?

                          MATT

           We don't know. That's why we keep

           talking. If someone is listening they

           might just save your life. Set your

           watch for ninety minutes.

          Matt reaches for a digital watch strapped to his wrist and sets

          up the timer for- 90 MINUTES.

                          RYAN

           Why ninety?

                          MATT

           Houston clocked that debris at fifty

           thousand miles per hour. Factoring in

           our current orbit, I reckon we've got

           90 minutes before we play duck and

           cover again.

          Ryan sets her watch, studies the counter as it begins to count

          down.

                          RYAN

           02 down to six percent.

          As they travel, the Shuttle begins to take form.

                          MATT

           Okay. Pretty scary shit being

           untethered up here, isn't it?

                          RYAN

           Yeah. Pretty scary shit.

                          MATT

           (after a beat)

           You did all right.

          Silence.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           (to the Shuttle)

           Houston, in the blind. This is

           Kowalsky. Our current location is

           approximately 900 meters out from the

           Explorer. Dr. Stone and I would like

           to retrieve the body of Mission

           Specialist Shariff and return it to

           Shuttle. Am I a go to retrieve?

          Silence.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Roger that.

          Matt changes direction and approaches Shariff. He has to ignite

          several small thrusts to try and steady his direction, fighting

          against Ryan's momentum.

                          RYAN

           Where is he? Where is he?

          Shariff's body is tethered to a PANEL that was ripped away from

          the Explorer. Matt approaches the panel and ignites the

          thrusters to slow down his course, and-

          He grabs onto it. Ryan, continuing her momentum, crashes against

          Shariff's body. The contact slows her trajectory, but it throws

          Shariff away, his tether tensing, pulling the panel with him.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

          Matt, holding on to the metal, spins with it. He detaches

          Shariff's tether from the panel and attaches it to himself.

          He lets the panel go and immediately ignites his thruster,

          pulling the two tethers behind him which, as they tense, bring

          Ryan and Shariff closer together.

                          MATT

           Grab him!

                          RYAN

           I'm trying. I'm trying.

                          MATT

           Quick. You're pulling me away.

                          RYAN

           I got him. I got him.

          Matt tries to ignite a very long thrust in the direction of the

          Shuttle, but this is difficult as the momentum of the other two

          bodies pulls him in all directions.

                          MATT

           Clutch him like he's your Valentine. I

           can't gauge my thrust with you two yo-

           yoing around.

          Tentatively Ryan extends her right hand to grab onto Shariff's

          body harness. And she sees-

          Shariff's broken helmet. A hole the size of a soft ball pierces

          through it and has left a tunnel of frozen dried bloody mess.

          Ryan's face is inscrutable. Finally she looks away, but this

          time something arrests her gaze:

          A LAMINATED PHOTOGRAPH floats next to Shariff, tethered to his

          suit via a small chain. In it, a YOUNG BOY LAUGHS with abandon,

          happy in the embrace of a man unseen save for his TWO STRONG

          ARMS. Transfixed, Ryan is unable to look away, something

          complicated confusing her eyes.

          The photograph floats in the empty space above Planet Earth.

          OUTER SPACE.

          As they approach, the damage to the Shuttle becomes apparent.

          Explorer has been badly hit.

                          MATT

           (under his breath)

           Jesus...

          The Shuttle has suffered devastating damage. The tail is beyond

          repair, one wing is completely destroyed, while the other

          waffles weakly, nearly sheared from the fuselage.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

                          (GRIMLY)

           Here's hoping you've got one monster

           insurance policy, Houston. Damages to

           Explorer are... it's totaled. Will

           commence search for survivors.

                          RYAN

           02 down to five percent.

          Matt thrusts to slow down his trajectory and slowly bumps

          against the windshield of the COCKPIT.

          At the mercy of Matt's momentum, Ryan hits hard against the nose

          of the Shuttle, losing her grip on Shariff.

          As she caroms off, she grabs onto what is left of the cockpit's

          window.

                          MATT

           All right, here we go. Careful of the

           edges.

          Matt takes his flashlight and looks through the broken windows,

          lighting the cockpit.

          Ryan pulls herself up and looks-

          THROUGH THE WINDOW-

          The cabin has been destroyed. A disarray of objects, smashed and

          devastated.

          At the end of the cabin, among the floating objects, a lifeless

          body drifts among the wreckage. Ryan regards it silently,

          mesmerized.

          BANG.

          The face of a second astronaut appears right in front of Ryan

          and crashes against her visor.

          The eyes are frozen, unblinking. Ryan GASPS, wheeling backward

          and away.

          Matt clicks Shariff's harness onto the Shuttle.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Houston, in the blind. To confirm.

           Mission Specialist Dr. Stone and

           myself, Mission Commander Matthew

           Kowalsky, are the sole survivors of

           STS-157.

          Matt turns to Ryan, who is staring at the dead astronauts

          inside.

                          RYAN

           I apologize for not complying. I

           should've stopped working as soon as

           you instructed me to.

                          MATT

           We were going to be hit no matter

           what. There was nothing you could've

           done to change that.

          He begins to reach out, hesitates briefly, then lightly touches

          her shoulder.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Hey.

                          RYAN

           Yes?

          She turns, no elbows this time.

                          MATT

           Alright... We have to get ourselves to

           the Space Station. There.

          Matt gestures vaguely to a bright dot in distance.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           It's a bit of a hike, but it's our

           only...

                          (CATCHING HIMSELF)

           It's our best option. Agreed?

          She stares at the dot.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Dr. Stone...

           (as she turns)

           Agreed?

          She studies his face and then, finally, nods.

                          RYAN

           Agreed.

                          MATT

           Alright. After you.

          He gently pushes her into space. She slowly drifts away from the

          Explorer but is suddenly stopped by the safety tether.

          Matt ignites his propellers and, giving a couple of small

          thrusts, he combats Ryan's swing. And with a LONGER THRUST-

          He shoots forward, pulling Ryan behind him.

          The two astronauts push forward together, leaving behind the

          shell of the Shuttle and the remains of the Hubble.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Houston in the blind, this is

           Kowalsky. Dr. Stone and I have

           determined to proceed to ISS and use

           one of their Soyuz for re-entry. ISS

           if copy, please send rescue mission.

           Repeat please dispatch rescue mission.

          They are heading toward a small point in the distance, the Space

          Station, which is in a lower orbit.

          OUTER SPACE. 550 KM ABOVE EARTH.

          We see the two astronauts crossing the distance - a thrust, and

          they coast ahead, and then another thrust. Matt pulls Ryan

          behind him.

          Two specks glide across the dark sky as a sliver of light grows

          on the darkened hemisphere.

          THE SUN IS RISING.

          WATCHING THE SUNRISE

          THE SUN looks brighter and clearer than ever outside of Earth's

          atmosphere. The oceans and the continents brighten as its light

          spills over the Earth beneath them.

          Warm rays of sun caress the two astronauts as they propel

          themselves across the empty expanse.

                          RYAN

           02 down to two percent.

                          MATT

           We're getting there.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Beautiful, don't you think?

                          RYAN

           What?

                          MATT

           The sunrise. That's what I'm going to

           miss the most.

          But Ryan is not into the view right now. She's stricken with

          fear. Her jaw is clenched and her eyes are almost closed.

          Matt looks at the dark emptiness that engulfs him and smiles.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           So, where's home, Dr. Stone?

          Ryan keeps her eyes closed, doesn't answer. Matt, trying to

                         DISTRACT HER-

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Ryan. Where's home?

          Ryan opens her eyes, but still she doesn't dare to look out of

          the helmet.

                          RYAN

           Home?

                          MATT

           Ah ha. Down there. Mother Earth. Where

           do you pitch your tent?

                          RYAN

           Lake Zurich.

                          MATT

           Where the hell is that?

                          RYAN

           Illinois.

                          MATT

           Illinois. Central time zone. That

           makes it roughly... 8pm right now.

           What are the good people of Lake

           Zurich doing at 8 o'clock in the

           evening?

          Ryan tries to overcome her fear and looks out. She frowns,

          terrified by the sight, and hides her face once more inside the

          helmet.

                          RYAN

           I don't know...

                          MATT

           What would you be doing?

          She tries again. This time she forces herself and stares out at

          the Earth, which is over 500 kilometers below her.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Come on. It's 8 o'clock. You've just

           clocked out of the hospital after

           putting in your customary 18-hour

           shift. You're driving home...

          Ryan's wide open eyes are transfixed on Earth, like a deer in

          headlights.

                          RYAN

           The radio. I listen to the radio...

                          MATT

           There we go. Let me guess. NPR?

           Classical. Top for--

                          RYAN

           Anything. Doesn't matter. As long as

           they don't talk. I just drive...

          Her glassy eyes reveal a strong emotion growing inside of her,

          taking over her body. It is not fear, it is something deeper and

          more painful.

          Matt studies her curiously.

                          MATT

           What do you miss down there?

          Ryan looks at the Earth. It never felt so far away.

          A long silence without an answer.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Is there a Mr. Stone?

          She frowns, unable to comprehend this initially, as if it were a

          particularly complicated bit of math, then shakes her head.

                          RYAN

           No...

                          MATT

           Nobody special? Someone down there,

           looking up, thinking of you?

          Ryan closes her eyes. She remains silent. A silence that can't

          hide an unspeakable pain.

                          RYAN

           I had a daughter.

          Her eyes flutter, then open. She is frozen in this moment, as if

          stunned.

          Her gaze shifts and finds-

          Matt, studying her in his MIRROR.

                          MATT

           What was her name?

                          RYAN

           Sarah... She was four. Stupidest thing-

           a school trip to the swimming pool.

           She was playing tag- she slipped, hit

           her head, and that was it... She loved

           tag. I'm sure she was laughing.

          She looks away, toward Earth. It looks small. Remote.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           When I received the call I was driving

           and ever since that's what I do. I

           wake up, I go to work and then I just

           drive.

          Matt finally averts his eyes. He rolls his wrist over, consults

          the timer, watching the numbers slowly count down.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           02 down to one percent.

                          MATT

           Well, well, what d'you know. I have

           good news and bad news.

                          RYAN

           Uhuh?

                          MATT

           The good news is we're five minutes

           from the ISS and I know where

           the Russians stash their vodka... and

           that's a good thing cus I'm running

           out of fumes. Bad news is I'm gonna be

           ten minutes short of......breaking

           Anatoly's record.

          SUDDENLY, COMING FROM INSIDE RYAN'S HELMET-

          BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.

                          RYAN

           Mmm...Mmmm.

                          MATT

           What?

                          RYAN

           I'm red lining... My O2 tank pressure

           is low...

                          MATT

           The tank may be empty but there's

           still oxygen in your suit, so sip,

           Ryan. Don't gulp. It's wine, not beer.

           Sip. We'll get you there.

          She nods.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Let's go.

          Matt gives Ryan a gentle push, waiting until the tether goes

          taut, and-

          He gives a SMALL THRUST to position himself in the right

          direction.

          He holds this SINGLE THRUST for longer than all of the previous

          ones, immediately gaining speed, descending towards-

          THE SPACE STATION-

          Which is half a mile away, and now all of its modules are

          clearly visible. It also becomes clear that-

          IT WAS HIT BY THE DEBRIS.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Houston in the blind we have visual of

           the ISS. Station must have been

           evacuated because first Soyuz is

           missing. Second Soyuz exhibits surface

           damage and chute has deployed. It's

           use as escape pod for re-entry to

           Earth is impossible.

          The surface of a module is badly scratched and some solar panels

          have been ripped.

          THE SECOND SOYUZ becomes visible, attached to the Station's

          Docking Module. A piece of red and white fabric floats around

          the spherical capsule.

          Ryan's losing her breath.

                          RYAN

           Shouldn't we be turning? We're

                          DRIFTING AGAIN--

                          MATT

           Sip, Ryan. Sip. Drifting is good. We

           want to drift. I wasn't kidding about

           those fumes. This can has one or two

           good thrusts left. If we're lucky....

          They approach the Space Station, which is just ahead of them and

          a hundred meters below.

          She's sweating and starts to hyperventilate.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Steady...

          She looks down, eyes the Station passing beneath them.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Ready... aim...

          It looks as though the Station is going to slip away altogether.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           ...fire.

          Matt triggers his THRUSTER, turning sharply. Ryan's trajectory

          carries her in a straight line, until the tether tenses,

          breaking Matt's direction.

          He fires again to counter her momentum.

          A VERY LONG THRUST sends both of them in the right direction,

          straight down toward the Station, but at great speed.

          The Station is getting very close, and they're going very fast.

          Matt ignites the FRONTAL THRUSTER, which begins to slow him

          down, but the thrust stops.

          Ryan, following her own momentum, begins to pass Matt.

                          RYAN

           Break... You have to break.

                          MATT

           I can't. Can's empty. We're coming in

           fast and we're going to hit hard. Grab

           onto anything you can and hold tight!

          Just then Ryan CRASHES against the SOLAR PANEL, but is unable to

          grab hold. As she tumbles past, the body of the Station looms.

          Matt misses the solar panels, and COLLIDES against the Station.

          As he begins to drift past, he reaches out and snares a railing.

          Ryan passes flying above him. The tether tenses, pulling Matt.

          The momentum is to great and he LETS GO of the railing.

          Ryan floats over the roof of the Space Station, trying to grab

          hold of the handles and rods that stick out of the modules, but

          she's floating too high.

          She's quickly reaching the end of the Station, there is only one

          handle left ahead, her last chance before floating away into the

          black void.

          She extends her arm and GRABS the handle tightly for dear life

                         AND-

          SHE STOPS.

          She's holding onto the handle.

                          RYAN

           I got it. I got it.

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

          She looks up and sees-

          Matt is floating straight toward her and-

          He COLLIDES against her. For a moment they are face to face,

          only the glass of their headgear separates their faces.

          But she loses her grip on the handle and the impact projects her

          into the emptiness.

          Her drifting is intercepted by a Solar Panel. She crashes

          against it, shattering it, as Matt rolls above it.

          Ryan bounces down towards the Earth, tensing the tether, pulling

          Matt, making him descend over the other side of the panel.

          The sharp edges of the broken panels cut the tether in two.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           The tether broke. I'm detached. I'm

           I'm detached.

                          MATT

           Grab a hold. Grab anything.

          Ryan is drifting away from the Station. She sees the infinite

          black void ahead of her and-

          HER FOOT GETS STUCK IN THE PARACHUTE.

          It becomes tangled in the strings and fabric, slowing her down.

          Ryan is panting, her face covered in sweat. She turns back and

                         SEES-

          Matt rolling, drifting in her direction.

          She stretches out her arm.

          Matt's arm is also outstretched.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

                          (AN EDGE)

           Give me... give me five here, Ryan.

          He's trying to make light of it, but he's really struggling to

          reach her.

          Ryan stretches farther.

          Matt's hand comes closer to hers.

          The tips of their fingers are almost touching.

                          RYAN

           I've got you. I've got you--

          The very tips of their fingers touch --

          BUT THEY MISS.

          As Matt drifts past.

                          MATT

           Shit... shit...

                          RYAN

           No. No. No. Don't you. No. Don't you.

           Don't. Don't. NO

          As the parachute tenses, she STOPS.

          The tether attached to Matt's suit passes two feet away from her

                         AND-

          Ryan grabs the tether. It slides through her closed fist, until-

          Her grip tightens and the tether STOPS.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Gotcha!

          Matt's momentum is now pulling Ryan, dragging her loose from the

          parachute.

                          MATT

           You have to let me go.

                          RYAN

           What? No--

                          MATT

           You have to.

                          RYAN

           No!

                          MATT

           Those ropes are too loose,

           I'm pulling you with me. You have to

           let me go or we both die--

                          RYAN

           I'm not letting you go! We're fine.

          Her leg slides through the loose rope and she floats further

          out, being snagged at the last minute by a tether around her

          foot. (We move from high-angle to low angle two shot). As this

                         HAPPENS:

                          MATT

           Ryan!

                          RYAN

           You're not going anywhere, you're not

                          GOING ANYWHERE--

                          MATT

           It's not up to you.

          Matt begins to unharness the tether.

                          RYAN

           Please don't do this.

          Matt has unhooked the tether and is holding it in his hand.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Please don't do this. Please don't do

           this.

                          MATT

           You're going to make it Ryan.

           RYAN (O.S.)

           No!

          He opens his hand, letting go of the tether, and BEGINS TO FLOAT

          AWAY.

          Relieved of Matt's pull, the parachute begins to retrieve,

          pulling Ryan closer to the Station.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           I had you! I had you.

          Matt drifts away from the Station into the empty space.

          Ryan bumps against the station, pulled by the parachute, and she

          twists and turns before finally grabbing hold of a rail.

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           Ryan do you copy? Do you copy?

          An ALARM GOES OFF.

                          RYAN

           My CO2 alarm went off. My CO2 alarm

           went off.

                          MATT

           You need to board the station. Can you

           see the airlock?

          She turns, looking for the Station's Airlock.

                          MAT

           Do you copy?

           (P.O.V shot - beginning to blur)

                          RYAN

           Yes. Yes. I see it. I see it.

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           Good. That's where you want to go.

           You're losing focus, right?

                          RYAN

           Yes.

                          MATT

           That's because you're breathing CO2

           and you're losing consciousness. You

           need to board the Station.

          Her eyes flutter...

                          MATT (CONT'D)

                          (ON RADIO)

           Move!

          Ryan blinks, TURNS OFF the ALARM, and begins climbing over a

          module of the Station.

                          RYAN

           Ok.

          The transmission becomes weaker, filled with STATIC.

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           Now listen to me. That second Soyuz is

           too damaged for re-entry,

           but it's perfectly fine for a little

           Sunday drive.

                          RYAN

           Sunday drive...?

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           Look to the west... You see that dot

           in the distance? That is the Chinese

           Station. You're going to take the

           Soyuz and cruise over there. The

           Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzou.

                          RYAN

           I've never flown a Shenzhou--

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           That doesn't matter. Its re-entry

           protocol is identical to the Soyuz's--

          She nods, already looking.

                          RYAN

           Ok.

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           You've never flown a Soyuz either.

                          RYAN

           Only on a simulator.

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           So then you know.

                          RYAN

           I crashed it. I--

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           It's a Simulator. That's what it's

           designed for.

                          RYAN

           Every time. I crashed the Simulator

           every time.

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           It's not rocket science. Just point

           the damn thing at earth and

           by this time tomorrow you'll be back

           in Lake Zurich with one hell of a

           story to tell. You copy? Ryan. You

           copy?

                          RYAN

           I'm going to take the Soyuz and come

           get you.

                          MATT

           No you're not. . I have too much of a

           head start. That ship already sailed.

                          RYAN

           No. I'm coming to get you.

                          MATT

           Ryan, you're going to have to learn to

           let go.

                          RYAN

           But... I...

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           I want to hear you say you're going to

           make it.

          Ryan is struggling for breath.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

                          (ON RADIO)

           Ryan! Say it!

                          RYAN

           I'm... I'm going to make it.

                          MATT

           Alright. Keep going

          Ryan stares at Matt's tiny figure in the distance.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           What kind of name is Ryan for a girl?

                          RYAN

           Dad wanted a boy.

                          MATT

           Are you close to the airlock?

                          RYAN

           Not yet.

                          MATT

           Keep going.

          Ryan continues to the Airlock.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           So, now that we have some distance

           between us- you're attracted to me,

           aren't you?

                          RYAN

           What?

                          MATT

           Well, people say I have beautiful blue

           eyes.

                          RYAN

           You... you have beautiful... you have

           beautiful blue eyes.

                          MATT

           I have brown eyes... that hurts.

          She looks at Matt's figure receding.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

                          (ON RADIO)

           You wanna know the good news?

                          RYAN

           What?

                          MATT

                          (ON RADIO)

           I'm going to break Anatoly's record,

           and I think mine's going to stand for

           a long, long time.

                          RYAN

           No... I'm coming to get you.

                          MATT

           You know, Ryan is a nice name for a

           girl. Wow, you should see the sun on

           the Ganges. It's amazing.

          Ryan starts to respond, then falters, watching Matt's figure

          grow ever smaller.

          THE SAD CROONING of HANK WILLIAMS crackles through the dying

          radio.

                          RYAN

           (in a daze)

           Matt...

          Only static hisses...

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Matt!

          Static again as Matt falls deeper into the distance, becoming

          lost in a sea of white specks and-

          The transmission ends.

                         SILENCE

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

          Ryan is dizzy, sweating, and having trouble focusing. She sees

                         MATT-

          Nothing more than a dot.

          She stretches her hand toward him, as if trying to touch him

          with the tips of her fingers. But the dot has already vanished

          into never-ending darkness.

          EVERYTHING IS BLURRED.

          Ryan is about to lose consciousness, when-

          A new ALARM GOES OFF.

          She takes one deep breath as she opens her eyes widely.

          If she doesn't move, she'll die.

          Ryan pulls herself forward, reaching for a handle on the Soyuz.

          She grabs it and reaches for another, climbing her way toward

          the Station's airlock.

          But she's losing focus.

          As her right hand is reaching for a handle, everything becomes a

          blur, and she misses.

          INSIDE THE HELMET -

          Her brain is shutting down from lack of oxygen. She struggles to

          open her eyes and mumbles words that are unintelligible.

          She reaches up again, almost blindly. Her hand grips the handle,

          and with one huge effort-

          She sprints across the Docking Module, swinging from handle to

          handle, in one continual push, until she reaches the-

          AIRLOCK.

          She stops, takes one deep breath and-

          She turns the latch and OPENS the re-entry hatch.

          The hatch BLOWS OPEN as the air inside the cabin escapes into

          the vacuum, almost throwing Ryan back into space, but she holds

          tightly onto the latch.

          She hangs outside, trying to gasp the last breath of oxygen

          inside her life system. She sees her feet dangling against the

          emptiness of space and-

          With one last effort, she pulls herself into the airlock.

          AIRLOCK MODULE. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. 500 KM ABOVE EARTH.

          As she enters she does a 180-degree flip. As soon as her legs

          are in, she grabs onto the latch, and-

          CLOSES THE HATCH.

          She turns the latch and-

          THE CABIN IS SEALED OFF.

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

          Ryan is suffocating. With very little oxygen and her body

          intoxicated by the nitrogen in her blood, her breathing is

          coarse and painful.

          She can hardly keep her eyes open, and she pushes herself

          through the cabin, an empty cylinder lit by two circular mercury

          lights. She reaches the-

          CONTROL PANEL, a small computer with a screen that monitors the

          atmospheric and temperature levels inside the airlock.

          She presses a button on the panel and-

          THE CABIN BEGINS TO PRESSURIZE.

          A low hissing sound can be heard as the tanks in the Station

          begin pumping pure oxygen into the airlock. The control panel's

          monitor shows the atmospheric levels slowly rising.

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

          Ryan gasps for air, but there is none.

          She stares at the red-orange-green graph on the control panel

          showing the atmospheric levels. It reads red. Her pupils begin

          to dilate as-

          SOUND BEGINS TO SURFACE-

          In the vacuum of space there was nothing to carry sound waves,

          but now sound begins to travel through the oxygen that slowly

          fills the cabin.

          The sounds are muffled, like the sounds of the outside world

          heard from within the womb.

          A beeping sound intermittently penetrates the airlock, anxious

          and halting.

          The Control System's graph slowly moves from red to orange. The

          cabin is still not fully pressurized.

          But that will have to do.

          With one sharp motion-

          SHE TAKES OFF HER HELMET-

          And pushes it from her head.

          She gasps for air and coughs.

          She contorts and shakes, fighting to breath in the thin

          atmosphere of the airlock. Her helmet bounces around the walls

          of the cabin, floating.

          The beeping sound has become clearer and recognizable - it is an

          alarm ringing out across the Station.

          Orange is turning to green. Her lungs begin to absorb the oxygen

          and her breath becomes more even. Her body floats, relaxed in

          the confined space of the airlock.

          SHE FLOATS.

          Ryan brings her hands together and removes one glove.

          And then the other.

          Desperately, she begins to unscrew the lock near her waist. She

          squirms under the suit and pushes off the upper half.

          Then she throws off the lower half, squirming out of it as if

          shedding her old skin, desperate to free herself from the

          claustrophobia of the suit.

          Wearing only underwear and a t-shirt, she floats in mid-air,

          relieved and exhausted. The hum of the Space Station surrounds

          her.

          Then, slowly, she pulls her knees to her chest and enfolds them

          in her arms, floating in a fetal position.

          For a moment, Ryan simply hangs in suspension, a fly in amber,

          surrendering to the poetry of the planets, rotating slowly in

          the cabin's womb.

          OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.

          SILENCE.

          The International Space Station, with its modules, its torn

          solar panels, and the Soyuz with its parachute billowing out

          from its center, is dwarfed against Earth's orb and the infinite

          universe stretching out beyond.

          The Station looks frail and secluded, lost somewhere between the

          grandness of the Heavens and the Earth below.

          Everything is still.

          INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. ZVEZDA MODULE.

          The module is like a wide corridor filled with cabinets, a small

          eating area and a small gym. A HUM reverberates across the

          station.

          At the end of the module there is an open circular hatch leading

                         INTO THE-

          UNITY NODE 1.

          A spherical space with three hatches, each leading into

          different modules.

          A HATCH OPENS and-

          Ryan floats in. She stops at the center and holds onto a handle.

          She looks in all directions and launches to her right, towards

                         THE-

          ZARYA MODULE.

          There are sleeping bags fastened to the walls. Clothes, shoes, a

          strip of three condoms -- all kinds of personal objects float in

          chaos around the module.

          It's clear that someone left in a hurry.

          Ryan passes a stationary bicycle and reaches for a metal cabinet

          on the wall.

          She OPENS drawers, looking for something.

                          RYAN

           Come on, come on.

          She finds what she's looking for: a BAG OF WATER with a straw at

          one end. She unscrews the top and begins to drink from it.

          She DRINKS in long gulps, squeezing the bottle, trying to quench

          her thirst. DROPS FLOAT out of her mouth as the water overflows.

          They float around her face like perfect pearls of different

          sizes.

          She takes a pause from drinking to catch her breath. The water

          is cooling her down, but she still takes another long, thirsty

          gulp and empties the bag.

          She checks the count on the STOPWATCH- 14 minutes and counting

          down.

          She takes a new bag of water from the drawer, and pushing

          herself off of a wall, she dives into the-

          UNITY NODE 2-

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           OK. Where are you? Where are you?

           Comms. Comms... There you are!

          Without stopping, she goes through one of the open hatches into

                         THE-

          ZVEZDA MODULE.

          The walls are filled with electrical equipment and wires.

          Without slowing down her momentum, she floats to the-

          MAIN CONSOLE- A large deck which houses all of the communication

          and navigational systems.

          On the opposite wall there is a LARGE PORTHOLE through which

          Earth is clearly seen.

          She begins to PUSH BUTTONS.

          COMPUTERS COME TO LIFE and Ryan puts on a communications

          headset.

          STATIC CRACKLES.

                          RYAN

           Matt. This is Ryan. Copy?

          She waits.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Matt. This is Ryan. Copy?

          Nothing... only static.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Matt, I made it. I'm here. I'm inside

           the Station... Do you copy?

          She drifts along the module, listening intently through the

          headset.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Come on Matt. Talk to me.

                          (NOTHING)

           Tell me where you are.

                          (NOTHING)

           Give me your position...

          No voices. Just static.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Where are you? Give me a visual...

           tell me what you see.

          Nothing.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Oh, come on. You've been yammering

           nonstop since we left Cape Canaveral,

           and now you decide to shut up?

          She waits ONE SECOND, TWO SECONDS-

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Come on Matt, talk to me!

          The signal cuts in and out, but remains indecipherable. There is

          something unnerving about it.

          She drops her head and continues drifting toward the porthole,

          listening as the STATIC SPUTTERS.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Say something... Anything.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Tell me about Mardi Gras. Tell me

           about the hairy guy. What happened?

          Waiting for him to respond, and in a softer voice, completely

                         RESIGNED-

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Oh Matt. I'm not ready for this.

          She bumps against the PORTHOLE, and glances out-

          The Earth glimmers brightly. A third of the hemisphere is in

          complete darkness. Her FACE REFLECTED in the glass is

          SUPERIMPOSED over the EARTH.

          Her eyes glisten briefly, but she fights it back. Then she pulls

          herself together, and begins reporting-

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Houston in the blind.

          The way Matt would have done it-

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone

           reporting from the ISS... All

           communication with Mission Commander

           Matthew Kowalsky has been lost. Radio

           transmission is absent. Visual is

           nonexistent.

                          (A BEAT)

           To confirm, I--Ryan Stone--am the sole

           survivor of STS-157.

          Ryan hovers by the porthole, looking hopeless.

          All is silent save for the RADIO static and the hum of the Space

          Station.

          Outside the Aurora Borealis performs its ghostly dance over the

          Earth's Northern Hemisphere.

          SILENCE. Only the hum and the static, when-

          An ALARM CHIRPS, RED LIGHTS FLICKERING across the module.

          Ryan twists, swimming back to the control panel, studying a

          FLASHING grid of LEDS:

          GRAPH OF THE STATION-

          ...where a blinking light indicates the Japanese Module IS ON

          FIRE.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           What now?

                         AND THEN-

          The Destiny Lab begins blinking.

          THE FIRE IS EXPANDING

          She pushes herself toward the hatch, swimming through the few

          pieces of paper still hovering as she exits into the-

          UNITY NODE 1.

          The ALARM'S STACCATO is blasting in synchrony with the emergency

          lights blinking across the station.

          SMOOTH BLUE FLAMES ribbon eerily across the skin of the Destiny

          Lab. They are spreading, expanding with a dense cloud of SMOKE.

          Ryan enters and snatches a FIRE EXTINGUISHER on the wall of the

          module, and-

          She points the nozzle at the fire and SPRAYS.

          With no gravity to hold her down, the force of the spray SENDS

          HER FLYING BACK and-

          SHE CRASHES AGAINST A WALL. The fire extinguisher bangs against

          her face and CUTS HER LIP.

          The impact is so strong that it almost knocks her out. Her eyes

          fill with tears but she reacts.

          There's no time to lose. She fastens her feet to a strap on the

          floor, and-

          SPRAYS the extinguisher at the fire. But the extinguisher is no

          match for the fire, which has gathered in a gigantic smooth blue

          ball and is expanding, coming at her.

          Ryan makes a fast turn and launches herself in the opposite

          direction into the-

                         UNITY NODE-

          Dashing straight into the-

                         ZARYA MODULE-

          She darts across the module, behind her-

          The expanding fire ball has swallowed the Unity Node and is

          making its way towards her, chasing her into the-

          UNITY NODE 2-

          Where she makes a quick turn and darts down into the-

                         DOCKING MODULE-

          Just in time. Above her, the flames cross the Node as they

          spread into the rest of the Station.

          They quickly spread downward, into the Docking Module.

          Ryan, the flames caressing her feet, dives through a hatch into

                         THE-

          SOYUZ. AIRLOCK.

          Ryan crashes against a Space Suit floating inside and turns to

          close the hatch.

          THE FIRE is spreading outside in the module, sucking the oxygen

          out of the Soyuz. An incandescent blue bubble that charges at

          her.

          Ryan, faster than fire, CLOSES THE HATCH.

          THE SOYUZ IS SEALED OFF.

          She closes a second hatch, and the Soyuz is safe.

          She exhales in RELIEF.

          A RUMBLE in the Station makes the Soyuz quake.

          The extinguisher is blocking her path to the hatch and Ryan has

          to push it into the cabin as she darts toward the-

          SOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN.

          As soon as she makes it through the hatch, she TURNS the CABIN

          LIGHTS ON.

          There is just enough space for three astronauts to sit

          surrounded by the CONTROL PANEL that navigates the vessel.

          She sits down in the command chair.

          She fastens the safety belt, and looks around, trying to

          recognize the different buttons on the panel, which are all

          labeled in Russian.

                          RYAN

           OK... where was it?... where was it?

          She moves her finger across the different buttons, searching.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Where is the power?... Here you are.

          Her finger stops on a button, which is labeled- BKN

          She presses on it and the CONTROL PANEL turns ON. All the

          buttons light up and with a hum, the Soyuz's systems start to

          run.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Good... good... just like training...

          Ryan reaches to the right, where next to the panel, there are

          several binders, each a different color.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Undocking... undocking... Yes...

           red...

          And she takes out a RED BINDER.

          It's all written in Cyrillic. She turns the pages until she sees

          a GRAPHIC representing the UNDOCKING PROCEDURE.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Ok... Ok... I remember this...

           undocking...

          She uses the CURSORS on the panel and selects a function on the

          COMPUTER SCREEN.

          She presses another button and-

          On the SCREEN, a COUNTDOWN- 4:30... 4:29... 4:28...

          Another RUMBLE in the Station.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           We don't have four minutes to spare.

           We're going manual...

          She flips through the binder to another page. She looks at a

          diagram and uses the cursors on the panel to change the function

          on the screen-

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Okay. Arming the system...

          She releases the SAFETY LOCK on a BUTTON.

          AN EXPLOSION in the Station makes everything shake. The

          vibration passes through her body, startling her, and-

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Firing the pyros...

          SHE PRESSES the BUTTON.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Rezerv rasstyk!

          The SOUND of a mechanism releasing reverberates throughout the

          vessel.

          OUTER SPACE. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. 500 KM ABOVE EARTH.

          SILENCE.

          A SPRING MECHANISM pushes the Soyuz away from the Station.

          SLOWLY.

          VERY SLOWLY.

          The Spacecraft is made out of three modules- the ENGINE, the

          CONTROL CABIN, and the AIRLOCK at the front.

          SOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN.

          Detached from the Space Station, the rumbling has ceased,

          leaving only the gentle hum of the cabin.

          ON THE PERISCOPE-

          The distance between the Soyuz and the Docking Module grows

          little by little as the vessel drifts away from it.

          Ryan sits tensely and checks the manual and-

          She presses different buttons, bringing to life a new set of

          systems.

                          RYAN

           I engaged manual control- R O A K and

           RYD are activated.

          She grabs the joysticks with her hand, and-

          OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.

          The lateral thrusters give a small thrust, and as the spacecraft

          moves away from the Station it drags its parachute, which floats

          lifelessly in space.

          ANOTHER BIGGER THRUST, and as the Soyuz pulls away from the

          Station, the parachute's ropes tense, and-

          A BIG JOLT.

          SOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN.

          Her seat belts prevent her from being projected forward as the

          Soyuz is pulled to a sudden stop.

          Ryan is very confused, unaware of the reason for the sudden

          stop. She looks at-

                         THE PERISCOPE-

          The Station is drifting out of the scope's sight.

          She turns to-

                         THE PORTHOLE-

          And through the glass she sees that-

          The Station is coming straight at her and it looks as though-

          THEY'RE ABOUT TO COLLIDE.

                          RYAN

           Oh, no. No, no, no.

          She presses the joystick.

          OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.

          The Soyuz is two meters away from the Station, about to crash,

                         WHEN-

          The SOFT JETS ignite, launching the vessel upwards.

          The Soyuz skims just over the Docking Module and passes three

          inches away from the solar panels, barely avoiding a collision

          with the metal giant.

          And as the Soyuz drifts upwards, the Station passes under it.

          SOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN.

          Now Ryan can see through-

                         THE PORTHOLE-

          The parachute is tangled with a solar panel and the ropes are

          tensing up, and-

          SHE'S SHAKEN BY A NEW PULL.

          OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.

          The Soyuz stabilizes over the Station, the parachute entwined

          with the solar panel.

          SOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN.

          She looks out at-

                         THE PORTHOLE-

          The rope extends from the cabin to the parachute tangled with

          the Station.

                          RYAN

           Great. Fantastic. Perfect.

          OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.

                         SILENCE

          The Station hovers below the Soyuz like a large whale swimming

          beneath a tiny lifeboat.

          The HATCH of the Soyuz OPENS.

          Ryan comes out of the craft into space. She's wearing the space

          suit she packed and she carries a large bag.

          She holds onto handles as she floats, SAFELY TETHERED to the

          inside of the cabin.

          She LOOKS around-

          The International Space Station is a looming presence floating

          ten meters below. It is pulling the Soyuz by its parachute.

          An ALARM on her STOPWATCH RINGS. It's been 85 MINUTES.

          She turns the alarm off and looks around.

                          RYAN

           Clear skies but with a chance of

           satellite debris.

          SHE HUMS A SONG, the tune is reminiscent of the Hank Williams

          Melody that Matt had played earlier.

          She begins to climb around the vessel. With plenty of oxygen in

          her pressurized suit, this is not a difficult task.

          She pulls herself from handle to handle, making her way around

          the Soyuz and reaching-

          THE PARACHUTE CONTAINER-

          An impact has blown open the cover. Three ropes float out of the

          container into space. Three meters away from the vessel each

          rope branches into dozens of parachute strings. Next to it-

          A second cover is also badly damaged.

          Harnessing herself to a handle, she inspects the ropes. The

          three ropes are bolted to the container's frame.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Okay. We detach this and we go home.

           Piece of cake.

          She harnesses the bag and RESUMES her HUMMING, louder this time.

          She unzips the bag and takes out the PISTOL GRIP tool, without

          noticing that behind her-

          DOZENS OF PIECES OF DEBRIS pass, zooming less than thirty meters

          away from the Station.

          A tiny piece of high-speed debris crashes against one of the

          Station's Solar panels, shattering it and causing the Station to

          tremble.

          She places the tool against the FIRST BOLT, stretching her arm

          into the parachute container. It is an awkward position.

          She pulls the trigger and the drill rotates, turning the bolt,

          but it slides out of the notch.

          She places the tool once more against the bolt and pulls the

          trigger. The drill rotates, SLOWER this time.

          She HUMS under her breath and SWEAT begins to drop down her

          forehead.

          She is very focused, unaware that behind her-

          DEBRIS HITS THE STATION'S SOLAR PANEL, piercing holes through

          it.

          THE BOLT COMES OFF.

          As it FLOATS OFF into space, Ryan drops the PISTOL GRIP and uses

          both hands to detach the rope from the frame.

          The ROPE FLOATS away from the Soyuz, undulating like a long

          snake, but-

          Ryan notices that the Pistol Grip is also floating away.

          She stretches her arm trying to catch it, but it is out of her

          reach.

          She pushes herself towards the pistol grip, and barely manages

          to grab onto it when she sees-

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Oh shit.

          THE TIDE OF DEBRIS is floating STRAIGHT AT HER.

          She pulls herself back to the container.

          DEBRIS HITS THE STATION.

          It CRASHES in SILENCE against one of its modules, creating a

          hole the size of a car wheel. The vacuum sucks BLUE FLAMES from

          the station that quickly die without oxygen to consume.

          Ryan brings the pistol-grip to the SECOND BOLT and pulls the

          trigger. The bolt spins.

          Ryan is HUMMING louder and louder.

          Ryan stares intently at the head of the bolt turning as the

          debris zooms by behind her.

          THE SECOND BOLT COMES OFF.

          She quickly pulls the rope loose from the frame and lets it

          float away.

          Shaken by the impacts, the Space Station drags the Soyuz with

          it.

          She braces herself as-

          DEBRIS WREAKS HAVOC- some pieces hit the Station, others crash

          against one another. Each collision creates more debris that

          ricochet and fly away in all directions.

          The Soyuz is pulled by the remaining parachute rope, as the

          Station spins out of control.

          Ryan starts humming even louder, the bravado is full tilt now.

          Her face is now covered in sweat, which pours into her eyes,

          making it difficult to see as she unscrews the last bolt.

          Behind her, a cluster of debris PIERCES THE PARACHUTE.

          Ryan continues drilling as-

          MORE DEBRIS HIT THE STATION.

          It CRASHES against the Japanese Lab, which silently EXPLODES

          into millions of pieces. The pieces expand away from the

          Station.

          THE LAST BOLT COMES OFF.

          Ryan manages to unhook the rope, freeing the Soyuz from the

          collapsing Space Station.

          She braces herself against the vessel, as she sees-

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Shit!

          The Soyuz is heading straight towards the Station's Solar

          Panels.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           No... no... no..

          The Soyuz' Solar Panel collides with the Station's, shattering

          into smaller pieces of debris that almost hit Ryan.

          The Soyuz spins away as-

          MORE DEBRIS HITS THE STATION.

          Ryan watches as a succession of satellite fragments pepper the

          slowly revolving Station segments. As the segments crumble,

          colliding with additional debris, the fragments glimmer

          magnificently then join...

          ...the THINNING TIDE OF DEBRIS orbiting toward the dark side of

          the Earth. All of a sudden...

          EVERYTHING IS CALM.

          She pauses, blinking into the suddenly empty distance. Her gaze

          remains fixed on the vast nothingness--for no good reason--but

          nevertheless FIXED on something.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           I hate space.

          SOYUZ SPACECRAFT. CONTROL CABIN.

          A SYMPHONY OF ALARMS shrieks loudly. The hatch FLIES open and a

          helmet floats in, followed quickly by Ryan.

                          RYAN

           Shut up!

          She presses different buttons, and with each a voice of the

          alarm symphony dies until they are completely silent.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Ok.

          She takes a breath and begins fastening the seat belt.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Alright. That's good.

          She puts on the communication headset and-

          Resets the STOPWATCH- 85 minutes and counting down.

          She checks the TEMPERATURE GAUGE-

          She exhales, the plume of her hot breath hanging briefly in the

          frigid cabin air before evaporating.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Okay, let's stabilise you.

          She takes the JOYSTICK.

          Ryan looks focused at-

                         THE PERISCOPE-

          Where the western horizon comes into frame and nears the center

          crosshair.

          A small dot GLIMMERS in the distance- THE CHINESE STATION.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Ok. Let's visit the Chinese station.

           Houston in the blind, Tiangong is

           approximately 100km... to the west and I

           am off it's course by about 3 degrees.

           I will correct trajectory.

          She moves the Joystick, and the crosshair readjusts.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Ok.

          She releases the safety lock and places her finger on the

          button.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Ok. I'll engage main thrust in five...

           four... three

          She releases the safety lock.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           two... one...

          She pushes on the button.

          OUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH.

          The Soyuz floats with its nose directed towards a bright star on

          the horizon, the Chinese Station, but-

          Nothing, not even a small flame, comes out of its back

          thrusters.

          CONTROL CABIN.

          Ryan waits, expectantly, and gives the button a NEW PUSH, but-

                          RYAN

           One...

          Nothing. The thruster won't ignite.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           One... one...

          OUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH.

          The vessel remains motionless, orbiting over the Pacific which

          is already under night's dark veil.

          CONTROL CABIN.

          She pushes again, and again, and again-

                          RYAN

           Come on. Come on!

          OUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH.

          But NOTHING.

          The Soyuz stays in place.

          CONTROL CABIN.

          Ryan looks at the FUEL GAUGE- 30 percent.

          She taps on it and the frozen needle drops to EMPTY.

                          RYAN

           You gotta be kidding me.

          She taps on the frozen dial once more, as if trying to get the

          needle to go back up, and once again-

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Where's your backup?

          She taps even harder this time.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Where's your goddamn backup?!

          She bangs down on the control panel in frustration--

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

                          FU--

          OUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH.

          Inside the capsule, through the portal, Ryan hits and hits,

          bouncing around the confined space of the cabin and venting all

          her anger, until she herself is out of fuel.

          She grabs the radio and-

                          RYAN

           This is Dr Ryan Stone, can you hear

           me? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can

           you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is

           Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy?

          THE SUN SETS.

          A magical cosmic act. As the sun nears the edge of the Earth,

          the atmosphere brightens, shining with a luminous orange light

          that is reflected off the surface of the Pacific Ocean.

          At the Soyuz's orbiting speed this does not last long. The sun

          quickly dips behind the edge of the Earth and the whole face of

          the planet is in shadow.

          The vessel is almost lost in the deep black of night.

          Fluorescent green light pours out of the porthole, like a lonely

          firefly lost in the deep of night.

          CONTROL CABIN.

          And the night has brought with it its cold grip.

          Ryan shivers and her voice is now weak, but she continues

          searching for help-

                          RYAN

           Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you

           hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan

           Stone, can you hear me? Copy?

          She turns her neck stiffly, looks at the-

          TEMPERATURE DIAL, -8 degrees and dropping. Through the PORTHOLE

          the SUN drops. DARKNESS descends.

          Finally, a SOUND SURFACES through the static:

          A CRACKLING.

          The CRACKLING SOUND is coming from the communication headset.

          Ryan puts it on and brings the mouthpiece to her lips.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Houston. Houston! This is Mission

           Specialist Ryan Stone. Do you copy!

          This glimmer of hope gives her a new burst of energy.

          She TURNS ON THE CABIN LIGHT and attempts to tune into the

          frequency, turning one of the control panel's dials. She frowns.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           (into the mouthpiece)

           Houston, you're coming in over the AM

           frequency. Please confirm identity.

          Fragmented words emerge through the static.

           Han... ni... ts...

          She turns the dial slowly, clinging desperately to the wavering

          thread of communication.

                          RYAN

           Repeat. This is Mission Specialist

           Ryan Stone from STS-157. Do you copy?

          Words BURST FORTH, ringing clear as a bell for a moment.

          appear to be in Chinese either.

          The voice on the transmission appears to be a man in a very

          plea.

          The barking of several dogs can be heard behind the man's voice.

          She GRINS.

          She listens to the man's laughing voice, shakes her head

          helplessly and sighs.

           Dogs! Woof. Woof. Woof.

          She makes barking noises. The man begins to laugh and barks back

          at her.

                          TRANSMISSION

           Auuu. Auuu. Oipmiq. Oipmiq! Auuu.

           Auuu.

          Ryan and Aningang bark in unison.

                          RYAN

           Woof. Woof.

                          TRANSMISSION

           Auuu... Auuu...

           RYAN AND TRANSMISSION

           Auuu. Auuu. Woof. Woof.

          Ryan begins to HOWL, giving in to the mad joy of it all.

          Moments later, through the RADIO, she is joined by a CHORUS of

          CANINES--Aningang's DOGS--TUNING INTO HER VOICE in a mad, crazy

          harmonic cacophony. Ryan smiles, blissfully happy, howling with

          abandon.

          Each howling reaches deeper and is more cathartic, unlocking

          emotions that have been festering over time, and-

          TEARS ROLL FROM HER EYES, clear as crystals, spilling from her

          lashes and floating INTO THE AIR, glimmering LIKE SAPPHIRES in

          the cool moonlight.

          They float away, like tiny satellites orbiting her face.

          Aningang can be heard intermittently, YELLING, as if trying to

          silence the dogs. Then the dogs, one by one, cease their wailing

          and Ryan is left with nothing but her own voice.

          She stops, gazing at her tears suspended in the gloomy blue

          light.

                          RYAN

           I'm going to die, Aningang.

          The SIGNAL ebbs, losing its battle with the STATIC.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           I mean, we're all going to die.

           Everyone knows that. But I'm going to

           die today...

          The STATIC waffles in and out.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Funny that. To know.

          The STATIC breaks and Aningang's HUSKY VOICE begins SINGING.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           And you know what Aningang... I don't

           care. I don't care if I die. I don't

           have anything... not anymore.

          Ryan is floating now over her seat.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           But the thing is... I'm still scared.

           I'm really scared...

          She rolls in space and stares upwards...

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           No one will mourn me. No one will pray

           for my soul. Will you mourn me,

           Aningang? Is it too late to say a

           prayer? I'd say one for myself, but I

           have never prayed in my life... no one

           ever taught me how...

          The tune is lyrical and soothing, tinged with a touch of

          melancholy.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           No one ever taught me how...

          Ryan listens to Aningang's melody and smiles softly, closing her

          eyes.

          Ryan's face grows slack as she drifts toward unconsciousness,

          buoyed along on Aningang's sad soulful song. Then...

          ...a SPUTTERING CRY cuts through the static.

          A BABY.

          Ryan's eyes pop open.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           A baby. There's a baby with you.

          A beat. Aningang stops singing, speaking in a soft voice:

                          TRANSMISSION

           Ieukpalliktuq upatimi...

                          RYAN

           You are singing to your baby? Is that

           a lullaby? That's so sweet!

          Ryan is transfixed, listening to the gentle gurgle of the baby

          as Aningang coos to it, then begins to SING again.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           I used to sing to my baby too.

          Painful memories flash before her, haunting her. Ryan's lump in

          her throat is washed away by a gentle sob.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           I hope I see her soon.

          She reaches for a valve and opens it.

          A HIZZING sound is heard inside the vessel, and-

          ON THE SCREEN-

          The Oxygen in the cabin's atmosphere begins to drop.

          SHE TURNS OFF THE LIGHT.

          Ryan closes her eyes, simply listening to the lullaby as it

          grows fainter...

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           (growing ever drowsier)

           That's nice. Keep singing, Aningang,

           just like that. Sing me to sleep. I'll

           sleep and sleep and sleep. Sing to me,

           Aningang... sing...sing....

          The transmission grows fainter...

          ...and fainter...

          ...and then is...

          ...gone.

          For a long beat Ryan merely sits there. She is gently humming a

          tune.

          It is a LULLABY.

          SHE SURRENDERS.

          SHE WEEPS.

          A quiet deep sorrow that silently grows in intensity and that

          finally explodes into-

          A SOFT WAIL.

          TEARS float around her like tiny satellites.

          The cold and the gentle humming of the Soyuz cradles Ryan.

          She closes her eyes, and as her breathing relaxes she begins to

          fall asleep, until-

          CLICK CLICK CLICK.

          Ryan opens her eyes, startled.

          CLICK CLICK CLICK.

          Ryan turns in confusion and looks at-

                         THE PORTHOLE-

          THROUGH THE GLASS, the helmet of an astronaut is looking in.

          IT IS MATT.

          He knocks once more, this time louder.

          CLICK CLICK CLICK.

          Ryan is still drowsy and does not understand what is going on,

          when she sees that-

          The latch on the porthole begins to move.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           No... no.. don't.

          But the latch continues to open.

          Ryan immediately straps herself to the commander chair.

          The latch keeps turning.

          Ryan covers her eyes and face with her hands when-

          THE LATCH RELEASES and

          THE HATCH SWINGS OPEN.

          The VACUUM of space sucks in one sharp gust all the air inside

          the cabin and with it every sound.

          The straps hold Ryan back as objects gush out through the hatch.

          Her hands press tightly covering her face.

          On the Control Panel alarms begin to flash.

          A SHADOWY FIGURE makes its way in and with one sharp motion-

          Turns and closes the hatch. Presses a green button and-

          The cabin begins to pressurize.

          And sound re-emerges with the beeping of the alarms as-

          The red-orange-green graph on the control panel show the

          atmospheric levels reaching green.

          Ryan uncovers her face and stares from the shadows at the

          figure, who straps into the seat next to her. He unlocks the

          ring around his collar and-

          TAKES OFF HIS HELMET.

          COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC escapes into the cabin.

                          MATT

           Ahhhh! Alright, check your watch. 13

           hours, 11 minutes. Call Anatoly, tell

           him he's been bumped.

          The figure glances around.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Bit gloomy in here. How `bout a little

           light?

          He taps a few buttons on the console and a face blooms:

          Matt.

          Ryan stares, mouth agape.

                          RYAN

           How did you?

                          MATT

           Trust me, it's a hell of a story.

                          RYAN

           But how did you?

          He reaches out and effortlessly flicks a myriad array of

          switches. Instantly, the alarms go silent.

                          MATT

           That's better.

                          RYAN

           How?

          Ryan looks at him wide eyed, wanting to know how-

                          MATT

           I found a little extra battery power.

           I'm just happy you're still alive. To

           be honest, I thought your chances were

           slim to none. By the way, did you find

           the vodka?

                          RYAN

           You never told me where.

          Matt fishes a SMALL FLASK from under his seat, spins off the

          cap...

                          MATT

           Oh well... To Anatoly! Na zdorovje.

          ...and takes a big gulp. He offers the flask to Ryan, who

          appears to be dozing off. She blinks, shakes her head.

                          RYAN

           No.

          He studies her.

                          MATT

           No? Right, let's get out of here.

          He looks at the monitors, where the Chinese Station is seen.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           We're `bout a hundred miles to the

           Chinese Station. A little Sunday

           drive.

                          RYAN

           We can't.

                          MATT

           Course we can.

                          RYAN

           There's no fuel. I tried everything.

                          MATT

           Well, there's always something we can

           do.

                          RYAN

           I tried everything.

                          MATT

           Did you try the soft landing jets?

                          RYAN

           They're for landing so.

                          MATT

           Well landing is launching it's the

           same thing, didn't you learn about

           that in training?

                          RYAN

           I never got to land the simulator, I

           told you.

                          MATT

           But you know about it.

                          RYAN

           And I crashed it every time.

          Ryan is falling asleep. Matt studies her as she dozes off.

                          MATT

           Listen you want to go back or do you

           want to stay here? I get it, it's nice

           up here, you can just shut down all

           the systems turn out all the lights,

           and just close your eyes and tune out

           everybody.

          Matt starts flipping through buttons on the console, turning the

          cabin lights off.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           There's nobody up here who can hurt

           you, it's safe. Then what's the point

           in going on, what's the point of

           living?

          When the cabin is in darkness, he turns and looks at Ryan.

                          MATT (CONT'D)

           Your kid died, doesn't get any rougher

           than that, but still it's a

           matter of what you do now. If you

           decide to go that you've gotta just

           get on with it, sit back enjoy the

           ride. You have to start living life,

           Ryan.

          Ryan is having trouble keeping her eyes open.

                          RYAN

           How did you get here?

                          MATT

           Ryan, you have to learn to let go ...

           Hey?

          Ryan is almost sound asleep.

                          RYAN

           What?

          Ryan is asleep.

                          MATT

           It's time to go home.

          Her eyes snap open.

          Her gaze shifts. The flask is floating in front of her. But no

          Matt. She turns. THE CABIN IS EMPTY. She turns back.

          CLICK CLICK CLICK.

          Ryan notices that the gate of the ventilation duct is shaking,

          making a percussive sound.

          A SOFT COOL LIGHT shines in through the condensation that has

          frozen on the glass. It is-

          THE MOONLIGHT caressing Ryan's face.

                          RYAN

           Landing, landing. Landing is

           launching.

          With a new surge of determination she TURNS ON THE CABIN LIGHT.

          She pulls the HELMET floating above her and puts it on.

          She connects the umbilical to her suit, opens the Oxygen Valve,

          and begins to breath.

          As the Oxygen flows back into her brain a new surge of

          determination brightens her face.

          She opens the valves of the other two umbilicals, allowing

          Oxygen to flow, pressurizing the cabin.

          She grabs the MANUAL.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Okay, landing, landing, landing is

           green.

          She opens the green binder and browses through its index.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Okay, okay landing, alright.

          She stops, turns some pages and stares closely at the manual.

          Ryan notices the Energy Bar floating by her. She grabs it and as

          she opens the wrapper, she stares intently at one page of the

          MANUAL, where there is-

                         A DIAGRAM-

          An ILLUSTRATION of the Soyuz Capsule two meters before landing

          and hitting the ground. A thrust is shooting out from under its

          bottom, cushioning its fall: THE SOFT LANDING ENGINES.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Soft landing jets trigger

           automatically at three meters before

           landing. ... you're a clever son of a

           bitch Matt. So to land I need to get

           rid of the BO and Engine module, okay?

          She puts on the communication headset.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Listen to me Matt. You're going to see

           a girl with brown hair. She's Sarah,

           her hair is probably a mess. That's

           okay, she doesn't like to brush it.

          She looks out of the porthole, down at Earth.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Tell her mommy found her red shoe. She

           was so upset about that shoe Matt, but

           tell her it was right under the bed.

          She turns back to the console and places her finger over one of

          the buttons.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           You give her a big hug and a kiss for

           me and tell her mamma misses her. Tell

           her she's my little angel and that she

           makes me so proud, so so so proud, and

           that I promise I'll try and make her

           proud too. You tell her that I'm not

           quitting, that I'm going to keep

           fighting. You tell her I love her

           Matt... I love her so much.

          Ryan smiles, remembering... and then-

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Tri module separation, go...

          She presses the button.

          OUTER SPACE.

          The locks connecting the three modules of the Soyuz release.

          CONTROL CABIN, AIRLOCK, and the ENGINES SEPARATE.

          A mechanism pushes the CONTROL CABIN away from the AIRLOCK and

          the ENGINES, and it slowly gains distance from them.

          CONTROL CABIN.

          Ryan scans through the complicated charts and diagrams in the

          manual.

                          RYAN

           Okay Houston, here comes the tricky

           part, the Soyuz has to think we're

           only three meters above the earth.

          A pause, and then-

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Let's reset you then.

          Using the manual as a reference, Ryan uses the cursors to select

          the ALTITUDE DISPLAY on the computer screen.

          The current ALTITUDE is- 2600 M.

          She uses the cursors and presses a button. A WARNING on the

          computer screen comes on.

          She presses another button, and-

          ON THE SCREEN, the ALTITUDE goes blank.

          Ryan punches a new set of commands.

          The ALTITUDE now reads- 3 meters.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Okay. I only have one shot at this.

           One shot...

          She extends her finger...

                          RYAN(CONT'D)

           What's the point if we don't try?

          SHE PRESSES THE BUTTON.

          OUTER SPACE.

          A THREE SECOND THRUST ignites at the back of the cabin, pushing

          it at great speeds toward the Chinese Station.

          SOYUZ CONTROL CABIN.

          The strength of the thrust pushes Ryan back in her seat.

          She looks at-

                         THE PERISCOPE-

          The Soyuz is approaching the Tiangong. The center of the

          crosshair is aiming three degrees above the Chinese Station.

          OUTER SPACE.

          The Soyuz is making its way rapidly towards the Chinese Station.

          CONTROL CABIN.

          Ryan is looking out of the window, at Earth-

                          RYAN

           Wow... you were right Matt... it's

           magnificent....

          She then turns to-

                         THE PERISCOPE-

          The Chinese Station quickly grows in size as the Soyuz gets

          closer and closer.

          ALTITUDE DIAL- 155 km and dropping.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           You're losing altitude, Tiangong. You

           keep dropping and you're going to kiss

           the atmosphere. But not before I get

           to you. You have my last ride home.

          A new sense of urgency comes up on Ryan's face.

          She unhooks the umbilical from her suit.

          She unstraps herself.

          She floats over and looks out of-

                         THE PORTHOLE-

          The Chinese Station is approaching, getting closer.

          She disarms the emergency exit and holds on to the LATCH.

          She pauses and turns to grab the fire extinguisher and holds it

          tightly against her chest with one arm. With the other arm-

          She reaches for the Latch.

          The Station is hovering right next to her and the cabin is going

          to pass it.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Okay, I'm done with just driving.

           Let's get go home.

          She turns the latch, and-

          PYROTECHNICS shoot the porthole into space.

          The brutal force of the infinite VACUUM of space SUCKS THE AIR

          out of the cabin, and-

          Ryan is LAUNCHED out of the cabin at a tremendous speed.

          SHE HITS HER SHOULDER as she goes through the hatch into-

          OUTER SPACE.

          A CANNONBALL WOMAN is launched up from the Soyuz's hatch. She

          passes the Chinese Station as she twirls up toward the Heavens.

          The Soyuz continues its straight trajectory toward Earth.

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

          Ryan is stunned from the impact and her shoulder is in pain.

                         OUTSIDE-

          Everything twirls.

          Earth and Heavens.

          An ALARM in her STOPWATCH RINGS. It's been EIGHTY-FIVE MINUTES.

          And she spins and sees-

          THE TIANGONG, one mile below her. And below it-

          A bright comet leaves behind a yellow scratch over the Earth. It

                         IS-

          THE SOYUZ BURNING upon contact with the atmosphere.

          Ryan drifts away. She holds tightly to the fire extinguisher

          with one hand, and with the other she checks her right shoulder.

          IT HURTS.

          But there's no time, the Tiangong is getting farther away. She

          points the nozzle of the fire extinguisher away from her and

                         TRIGGERS A-

                         SPRAY-

          It acts like a thrust that pushes her toward the Station. It

          helped, but she is still off target.

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

          She is in pain.

          The glass visor is steaming up.

          She begins HUMMING as she looks at-

          The Station drifting ahead, less than five hundred meters away.

          From this distance the damage caused to the Tiangong by the

          debris is clear. The solar panels are shredded to pieces, and

          several modules appear to have been badly hit.

                         RYAN GIVES-

                         ANOTHER SPRAY-

          Propelling herself even closer to the Station.

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

          She stops humming. Her breath is fogging up the glass, giving

          her a blurred view of-

          The Station, which is less than a hundred meters away. She can

                         SEE THAT-

          The LIFEBOAT, the SHENZHOU, a vessel very similar to the Soyuz,

          is docked on a module.

          It's now clear that she's not flying straight toward the

          Station.

          Ryan attempts to correct her trajectory by giving-

                         ANOTHER SPRAY-

          But only a very SMALL THRUST comes out of the extinguisher, not

          enough to push her on the right track.

          She PULLS the trigger again-

          But only a few dust particles come out. The extinguisher is

          empty. She lets go of it and it floats away.

          She drifts toward the Station, SLOWLY.

          She is less than twenty meters away, and getting closer.

          AND CLOSER.

          And she misses it by a hair.

          She drifts, very slowly, two meters above the Station.

          Her arm, outstretched, tries to grab hold of anything it can.

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

          Ryan winces in pain and looks at-

          Her outstretched arm reaching toward-

                         THE STATION-

          She slowly drifts across the modules, the tips of her fingers

          almost touching the surface of the Tiangong.

          A handle passes under her, almost within reach, but she does not

          manage to hold onto it.

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

          She's struggling, but she knows she's not going to make it. She

          looks ahead at-

                         THE STATION-

          A solar panel, following the rotation of the Station, comes into

          view.

          She stretches out her arm as she gets closer to it.

          But the solar panel continues its rotation and she is

          approaching very slowly.

          The panel is rotating away.

          She STRETCHES, and-

          She GRABS onto a rod on the Solar Panel, STOPPING her momentum.

          Ryan hangs from the Station. She holds her right arm tightly to

          her chest.

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

          She catches her breath and is clearly in pain.

                         RYAN SEES-

          A LONESOME PIECE OF DEBRIS.

          It hovers above the Station and glows as the sunlight hits its

          surface. It passes very quickly.

          And there's ANOTHER ONE cruising farther above.

          She pulls her right arm up.

                          RYAN

           Ahhhhhh!

          The pain is excruciating, but she grabs onto the panel's rod,

                         AND-

          SHE PULLS HERSELF UP, and clinging with her leg, she secures

          herself to the panel.

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

          She's panting, and through the fogged up glass she can see, far

          away over the horizon-

          BRIGHT DOTS.

          Pieces of debris burn as they hit the atmosphere. A swarm of

          incandescent locusts that-

          Is coming directly at her.

          Ignoring her pain but using her right arm as little as possible,

          she climbs up to-

          THE BODY OF THE STATION.

          She goes over the module and makes her way across, pulling

          herself from handle to handle.

          When she reaches the end of it, with one last BIG PULL she makes

          it to the-

          HATCH that leads into the airlock.

          With her bad arm she holds onto a handle.

          With the other, she pulls on the latch and-

          OPENS THE AIRLOCK.

          A gust of AIR bursts out, pushing the hatch wide open.

          Ryan holds on tightly to the handle.

                         ABOVE HER-

          Clusters of DEBRIS pass by, flying at different distances and at

          great speeds.

          Pieces COLLIDE with each other, exploding into more debris.

          A BIG PIECE OF DEBRIS is flying downward, missing the Station by

          ten meters as it continues its descent. And-

          250 meters below, it BURNS like a shooting star.

          The Station is rapidly approaching Earth's atmosphere.

          And over the Eastern horizon-

          A CLOUD OF DUST is quickly approaching.

          THE TIDE OF DEBRIS.

          TIANGONG. AIRLOCK. 150 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.

          Ryan secures the hatch.

          The airlock is smaller than the one in the International Space

          Station but, like the ISS, there is a small control panel on one

          side.

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

          The glass is almost fogged up. She makes her way to the-

                         CONTROL PANEL-

          The red, yellow, and green graph is bright red. Under it, TWO

          BUTTONS with Chinese ideograms on them.

                          AND

          Her finger hesitates as she takes a wild guess.

                         SHE PRESSES-

          A FAINT HISSING SOUND is heard.

          THE CABIN PRESSURIZES.

          As oxygen fills the space-

          SOUND BEGINS TO EMERGE.

          Unrecognizable at first is a rhythmic pattern under a syncopated

          murmur. But as air allows sound to conduct its waves, it becomes

          clear.

          AN ALARM IS GOING OFF.

          Over it a recording plays in a LOOP. It is in Mandarin. The

          VOICE in the recording is urgent. Clearly it is not good news.

                          LOOP

          She's in pain and more tired than ever now, and she's punchy.

                          LOOP (CONT'D)

          She waits, floating.

          INSIDE THE HELMET-

          The glass is completely fogged up. Through the condensation, she

          can only discern a RED LIGHT filtering through.

          She waits.

                          RYAN

           Come on. Come on.

          And when the RED GLOW turns to ORANGE-

          Ryan UNLOCKS her helmet and, using only her left hand, struggles

          to take it off.

          As the helmet floats, bouncing off of the cabin walls, Ryan

          massages her injured shoulder. She does this gently, as even the

          smallest pressure inflicts pain.

          The orange light is turning green when-

          She feels the Station quake fiercely, reverberating through the

          handle she's holding onto.

          THE STATION RUMBLES.

          OUTER SPACE.

          The Tiangong is plummeting.

          The tip of a solar panel is already grazing over the outer

          layers of the atmosphere, leaving a trail behind it as it parts

          the gases.

          DEBRIS passing under the Station burn up.

          TIANGONG NODE 1.

          EVERYTHING SHAKES.

          Ryan rushes out of the airlock.

          A new intensity sparkles in her eyes. Her fearlessness and

          determination are bordering with madness.

          She inspects her surroundings. Through a hatch she sees a long

          corridor-like cabin that leads to another node. It is the LAB

          MODULE.

          The LOOP keeps on playing.

                          LOOP

          She enters the hatch into the-

          TIANGONG LAB MODULE.

          The only light is coming from flickering emergency lights.

          Objects float in chaos.

          Ryan makes her way, dodging the disarray of lab objects-

          Scientific instruments: A plant drifting by with its roots

          exposed, clusters of liquid floating like wobbly spheres, two

          eggs hovering, one of which is broken.

          THE SHAKING INTENSIFIES as-

          She reaches the end of the module and goes into the-

          TIANGONG NODE 2.

          She floats to the center of the node.

          There are three open hatches- RIGHT, LEFT, and-

                         BELOW-

          A Docking Module, very similar to the one in the ISS. At the far

          end of it an open hatch leads into the SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.

          MORE RUMBLING SHAKES THE STATION.

          OUTER SPACE.

          A SOLAR PANEL, defeated by the friction with the atmosphere,

          breaks off from the Station and is thrown farther down, where it

          quickly burns, dissolving into sparks.

          The TIDAL WAVE of debris is catching up with the Station, a

          cloud of metal pieces that sparkle with the sunlight.

          BRIGHT STREAKS can be seen as debris burns, scratching through

          the atmosphere.

          TIANGONG NODE 2.

          Ryan springs into the-

          DOCKING MODULE.

          Floating through it and reaching the open hatch at the other

          end, she tosses the helmet inside the Shenzhou.

          A LOUD METALLIC ROAR. The Station is collapsing. She dives

          through the hatch into the-

          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. AIRLOCK.

          It is almost identical to the Soyuz's airlock.

          She does a quick flip and-

          CLOSES the outer hatch.

          Then she pulls on another latch and-

          CLOSES the inner hatch.

          The Shenzhou is SEALED OFF from the rest of the Station.

          She throws the helmet into the Control Cabin and follows

          through, into the-

          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. CONTROL CABIN.

          She struggles to turn around in the confined space, and then-

          She pulls the hatch CLOSED.

          THE CONTROL CABIN IS SEALED.

          The Shenzhou is smaller than the Soyuz and has only one seat. In

          this confined space, the SHAKING of the station is felt even

          stronger.

          She sits, BUCKLES herself in, and looks at the-

          CONTROL PANEL.

          It has more monitors than the Soyuz's panel, and the main board

          is arranged differently. All of the buttons are labeled with

          CHINESE IDEOGRAMS.

          AND IT IS SHAKING FIERCELY.

                          RYAN

           Seriously?

                         THROUGH-

                         THE PORTHOLE-

          A thin bright yellow halo covers the whole window.

          OUTER SPACE.

          The yellow halo envelops the whole Station as it glides over the

          outer atmosphere.

          FRICTION.

          The remaining SOLAR PANEL resists breaking off from the

          structure, but still goes up in flames, leaving a trail of

          SPARKS.

          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.

          EVERYTHING IS SHAKING.

                          RYAN

           In the Soyuz the power button is

           erm....here!

          She passes her finger over the board, trying to make sense of

          the buttons.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Ah, ok ah undocking,

           undocking....eenie, meenie,...

                         SHE PRESSES

          An ALARM RINGS, and under the ongoing LOOP, a RECORDING, clearly

          warning.

                          RECORDING

                          RYAN

           Ok. That doesn't sound good....

          She glances around frantically, turns it off.

          It's shaking very intensely but she's wide-eyed now, clearly

          close to being beside herself.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Miini... moh...

          She tries a BIG BUTTON that says-

          A NEW ALARM, followed by a NEW RECORDING, also a warning-

          And with a horrible accent-

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           No hablo chino.

          She keeps searching for the right button.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Mini... moh...

          And she presses a new one.

          The LIGHTS on the Control Panel GO ON. The cabin makes a humming

          sound as SYSTEMS BEGIN TO ACTIVATE.

          On the control panel lights go on in patterns reminiscent of the

          switchboard in the Soyuz.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Okay....okay...

          She begins going through the progressions she used on the Soyuz,

          only quicker this time, jabbing button after button.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Good...good...There. And this should

           be...

          She presses one more button and systems turn to green.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Okay... Houston in the blind...

          She raises her voice to be heard over the GROWING RUMBLE.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone

           reporting from the Shenzhou. I'm about

           to undock from the Tiangong and I have

           a bad feeling about this mission.

          She presses a new button and the system goes to green. And on

          the MONITOR a COUNTDOWN appears.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Reminds me of a story, Houston--

          She reacts to a bad shake of the cabin.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Okay, you know what, Houston? Never

           mind the story...

          She looks around as the cabin starts shaking even harder.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           It's getting hotter in here.

          She watches the COUNTDOWN on the MONITOR- 3:59... 3:58...

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           The way I figure it, there's only two

                          POSSIBLE OUTCOMES--

          Ryan keeps her eyes fixed on the countdown. Raises her voice to

          compete with the rising chaos...

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           I either make it down in one piece and

           I'll have one hell of a story to

           tell...

          And now the noise and the shake are nearing their peak...

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           ...Or I burn up in the next ten

           minutes.

          Ryan smiles, flips the safety lid of a button open.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Whichever way it goes, no harm no

           foul.

          As the cabin RATTLES VIOLENTLY.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Because either way--

          She closes her eyes, puts her finger over the button.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           It'll be one hell of a ride.

          Ryan presses the button.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           I'm ready.

          OUTER SPACE.

          The Station is bouncing over the atmosphere. One end of it is

          glowing more brightly and catches FIRE.

          The TIDE OF DEBRIS is getting closer. Not far off some pieces

          are already burning.

          A LARGE PIECE OF DEBRIS has caught on fire and is flying at

          great speed and-

          COLLIDES WITH THE STATION,

          Tearing it into two parts, which are sent twisting in opposite

          directions. The ESCAPE POD, attached to the DOCK, is spinning

          towards earth.

          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.

          Ryan is SHAKEN and RATTLED in her seat.

                          RYAN

           Yeehaaa!

          GRAVITY is still minimal, but the force of the inertia is rough

          and it jerks her around. She sees-

          A RED LEVER above her, but she can only reach it with her bad

          hand.

                         SHE STRETCHES

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Ahhhhhhhh!

          SHE GRABS THE LEVER-

          AND PULLS IT.

          OUTER SPACE.

          THE LOCKS DISENGAGE-

          THE CABIN separates from the rest of the vessel and from the

          Station. It spins away, plummeting toward the atmosphere.

          The two fragments of the Tiangong follow, spinning in a rage of

          sparks and fire.

          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.

          The spinning is punishing. Ryan is shaken violently. She is also

          mumbling words to herself that we can't hear. It looks like she

          rambling.

          Some LIGHTS GO OFF.

          ATMOSPHERE. 130 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.

          The capsule's aerodynamics slow down the spinning, positioning

          the vessel nose up.

          It cuts through the atmosphere at incredible speeds.

          Its metal is burning hot.

          Smoldering DEBRIS and the fragments of the STATION chase the

          Shenzhou in its descent.

          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.

                         THE PORTHOLE-

          A blinding light pours in from outside the window.

          The spinning is over, but the cabin vibrates with a loud rumble.

          As the G-Force restrains Ryan against her seat, she clenches her

          face and sweats.

          On the ceiling, condensation begins to form.

          ATMOSPHERE. 120 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.

          The Shenzhou is a ball of fire precipitating from the skies.

          It's followed very closely by DEBRIS and the two fragments of

          the STATION.

          The TWO FRAGMENTS COLLIDE and EXPLODE into a ball of fire that

          breaks into many pieces.

          An avalanche of fire cascades towards the Shenzhou, rapidly

          closing the distance.

          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.

          In THE PORTHOLE-

          Outside burning debris is passing by. The gravitational pull

          keeps Ryan tense in her seat as drops fall on her face. She

                         LOOKS AT-

          THE CEILING- where condensation is dripping.

          ATMOSPHERE. 100 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.

          The avalanche is about to swallow the cabin when the burning

          debris disintegrates before reaching the cooling STRATOSPHERE.

          The capsule escapes the inferno as the debris crumbles in a

          final explosion expelling-

          A VERY SMALL PIECE OF DEBRIS that-

          SHOOTS towards the Shenzhou and-

          SKIMS its surface, tearing one of the outer shields.

          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.

          The impact is felt inside and a panel falls off. A small smoke

          trail is formed around its wires.

          Ryan is restrained against her seat by the gravitational force

          of the fall and-

          EVERYTHING IS SHAKING.

          LOWER ATMOSPHERE. 70 KM ABOVE EARTH.

          The Shenzhou has left the burning debris behind.

          As it touches the lower atmosphere, it immediately COOLS DOWN,

          dimming its brightness, surrounded by a purple sky.

          It FREEFALLS 9.8 meters per second and-

          A PARACHUTE RELEASES.

          The long fabric comes out and EXPANDS as the air fills the red

          and white canopy. When it's fully open it SLOWS DOWN the cabin's

          descent and lets it glide in a diagonal path over the Earth.

          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.

          A BREATH OF RELIEF, as through THE PORTHOLE-

          She sees the ropes of the parachute extend out to the large

          canvas cushioning the fall.

          LOWER ATMOSPHERE. 10 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.

          A SECOND PARACHUTE expands.

          It slows the fall even further, shifting the cabin into a more

          vertical descent toward the ground that is so close it now seems

          tangible.

          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.

          Ryan starts COUGHING.

          The cabin is quickly filling with SMOKE, and-

          The white cloud of smoke overflowing the small space is getting

          thicker.

          LOWER ATMOSPHERE. 1 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.

          The Shenzhou drops, hanging from the parachutes, at a speed of

          thirty kilometers per hour.

          It is surrounded by a blue sky. It passes through a layer of

          clouds.

          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.

          She coughs as the white smoke is becoming unbearable. She's

          suffocating.

          LOWER ATMOSPHERE. 100 METERS ABOVE THE EARTH.

          The Shenzhou is rapidly approaching the ground.

          It is falling straight toward a lake. Two meters before hitting

                         ITS SURFACE-

          THE LANDING ENGINES IGNITE, giving the downward thrust meant to

          cushion the landing on a hard surface.

          The thrust parts the water, creating a curtain of steam, and the

          Shenzhou gently falls down-

          INTO THE LAKE-

          Making a wave that spreads out in a circle.

          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.

          Ryan feels the cabin hit the water. She has landed safely.

          But she cannot celebrate because she can't stop coughing. She is

          asphyxiating in the thick cloud of smoke.

          She UNSTRAPS herself and-

          Reaches a LEVER at the side of the hatch.

          She PULLS THE LEVER.

          ON THE LAKE.

          With a small controlled explosion, the hatch cover is launched

          away from the cabin.

          Smoke pours out through the open hatch.

          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.

          She begins to unstrap herself when-

          WATER POURS IN through the open hatch.

          She tries to make her way out, fighting against the strong

          current that is gushing in, but the flow is too strong and-

          IT PUSHES HER BACK IN.

          She struggles to force her way through the cascade rapidly

          filling the cabin, but it is too strong.

          THE CABIN IS OVERFLOWING.

          The water has reached Ryan's chin when-

          She manages to take ONE LAST DEEP BREATH of air before-

          WATER COMPLETELY FILLS IT.

                         UNDERWATER

          The metallic capsule, which weighs almost three tons, sinks

          quickly into the lake. As the ropes of the parachute tense, the

          long fabric follows the cabin down.

          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.

          Air trapped inside Ryan's suit leaks out through the collar and

          small bubbles float up.

          Ryan fights her way to the hatch, and pulling with her good arm,

          she swims out.

          UNDERWATER.

          She pushes herself away from the cabin, swimming away from the

                         POD AS-

          THE SHENZHOU HITS THE LAKE BOTTOM.

          A dark cloud of mud swells up around it.

          Ryan struggles to SWIM UP to the surface, but she can only use

          one arm and the wet suit is DRAGGING HER DOWN.

          She strokes rapidly, but she isn't moving up. Instead-

          SHE'S GOING DOWN, and

          HER FEET SINK INTO THE LAKE BED.

          She looks up and sees-

          The rays of sunlight breaking through the lake's surface are

          eclipsed by the parachute, which floats down toward her like a

          huge jellyfish about to engulf its pray.

          THE FROG crosses in front of her, effortlessly swimming on its

          way to the surface.

          Small bubbles of air come out of Ryan's nose as she struggles to

          open her suit.

          She takes off the BOTTOM PART of the suit.

                         ABOVE HER-

          THE PARACHUTE IS GETTING CLOSER, a net about to trap her.

          She struggles out of the TOP PART of her suit. And squirming out

          from under it-

          She frees herself from the heavy garments and SWIMS UP as-

          THE SINKING PARACHUTE traps her foot and begins dragging her

          down. But with a kick-

          SHE SETS HERSELF FREE, and-

          SHE SWIMS UP, stroking with her good arm. She is completely out

          of breath, only the tiniest bubbles rise from her nose.

          She is about to lose consciousness, when she sees-

          THE FROG swimming ahead of her, sliding smoothly through the

          water toward the rays of sunlight diffracted by the surface.

          Ryan's eyes are closed as she floats up, her body limp. The

          surface is coming closer and closer.

          She reaches the thin boundary between water and air and she come

          out to the-

          SURFACE.

          And she takes an enormous breath.

                          RYAN

           AAAHHHHHH!

          Almost primal, like the first breath of a newborn child, it

          burns her lungs but reclaims life.

          She only has enough strength to keep her face above water. She

          FLOATS, catching her breath and taking long gulps of air.

          She looks up at-

                         THE SKY-

          Where the clouds move, caressed by air and light. And beyond

                         THEM-

          OUTER SPACE, but-

          SHE'S BACK ON EARTH.

          She turns around, and-

          TAKING A DEEP BREATH-

          She SWIMS, breaking through the water and harnessing every last

          bit of energy in her.

          And soon she arrives to the-

          SHALLOW EDGE OF THE LAKE

          She drags herself from the water, like the first amphibious life

          form crawling out of the primordial soup onto land.

          COLLAPSES ON THE SHORE.

          The water laps gently over her, washing in and out around her

          legs.

          SHE LIES with her face against the muddy shore and her eyes

          closed, recovering her strength.

          AND SHE BREATHES.

          SHE BREATHES AIR.

          And as her breath steadies-

          SHE SMILES.

          She pushes her face against the ground, enjoying the sense of

          weight, and-

          SHE OPENS HER EYES.

          Then she looks at her surroundings, taking in the almost

          unbearable beauty of the planet Earth.

          She's breathing deeply and begins to cough.

          It's not a cough, it's a chuckle.

          RYAN IS CRACKING UP.

          Ecstasy overcomes Ryan and-

          Joyful laughter fills her body.

          SHE IS ALIVE.

                          RYAN

           Thank you.

          She PLANTS HER PALMS against the ground and-

          With an effort, she pushes herself up.

          SHE FEELS HER WEIGHT, and manages to rise to her hands and knees

          like a four-legged mammal.

          And she STANDS UP.

          ONE FOOT FALLS heavily on the ground. It sinks into the mud and

                         THEN-

          ANOTHER FOOT.

          Ryan's FEET are solidly planted on the mud.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)

           Ahhhhh!!!

          One foot moves forward and lands on more solid ground, unstable,

          coping with the weight. And then-

          The other foot follows as-

          SHE BEGINS TO WALK ON PLANET EARTH, laughing.

          SHE IS PUNCH DRUNK.

          SHE IS FREE.
