	SECOND REV.

	7/29/1993

	FADE IN:

	INT. PROFESSOR OCK"S PRIVATE PHYSICS LABORATORY, THE

	CYCLOTRON ROOM (CREDIT SEQUENCE) - DAY

	A mighty WARNING KLAXON assaults our ears. A FLASHING RED

	WARNING LIGHT stabs our eyes.

	Several DIALS go into the RED. A hand pushes aside a

	YELLOW THERMOS and pushes forward a RED POWER THROTTLE.

	We hear the WHINING UP of a cyclotron. A DIGITAL DIAL

	climbs to "5% POWER." A SPIDER crawls across a DIAL.

	Begin OPENING CREDITS.

	THE CYCLOTRON ROOM is in an old basement full of peeling

	paint and plumbing wrapped with TAPE. Leaks are here and

	there. COBWEBS are all around.

	DOCTOR OTTO OCTAVIUS (OCK) is a strong but strange

	featured man in his mid-fifties.

	His assistant, WEINER, hovers nearby looking on. He's

	open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity. WEINER is

	a local, small-time hood hired by OCK to circumvent the

	school administration and to "procure" whatever OCK needs

	for his experiments. He shades his eyes against a searing

	BLUE-WHITE BEAM that erupts from the WINDOW. THE ROOM IS

	DIVIDED INTO A CONTROL ROOM AND THE EXPERIMENT CHAMBERS.

				WEINER

		Whoa, whoa, whoa... what's that?

	With a WHOOSH, the WINDOW EXPLODES, showering the TWO with

	shards of GLASS, and throwing them to the floor.

				OCK

			(rising)

		We begin again... let's kick in that new

		transducer. See if we can double the

		power output.

				WEINER

			(rising more slowly)

		Whoa, Doc... wait a minute...

	But OCK is already at the THROTTLE. The cyclotron whirls

	up. The lights go on. Louder, brighter than before. OCK

	looks through the broken WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL

	CHAMBER. The POWER DIAL inches upward, "eight, nine..."

	the BLUE-WHITE LIGHT is blinding now. The WHINE pitch is

	shattering.

	END OPENING CREDITS.

				OCK

		Okey... dokey!

	The POWER DIAL hits ten.

	EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY

	As STUDENTS go to class, the sound of the cyclotron spills

	out of the SCIENCE CENTER onto the grounds of Empire State

	University.

	We see PETER PARKER, a pleasant faced senior who's among

	the top in his class. Sincere and serious, he has yet to

	develop a way with women.

				LIZ

			(falling in step)

		Hiya Peter...

	LIZ ALLEN is also a senior. She's beautiful and

	intelligent.

				PETER

			(ardent but

			uncomfortable)

		Hiya Liz... how're you doing...?

				LIZ

			(teasing softly)

		How'm I doing what?

				HARRY

		Peter! Peter! Wait up!

	HARRY is the school nerd. A quirky kid who, like PETER,

	can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty

	ones like Liz.

				HARRY

			(to Liz)

		Would you, uh... excuse us for a minute?

	Despite PETER'S protesting body language, HARRY pulls him

	away like a conspirator.

				PETER

		What is it? what...

				HARRY

		Did the Astro-Physics Journal really

		accept your paper?

				PETER

			(laughs, embarrassed)

		Yeah... well... all I got's the data but

		they've agreed to publish it when it's

		finished. You know... it's my

		calculation on the Planetary Conjunction.

				HARRY

		And its influence on the anti-force.

		Isn't it?

				PETER

		Yes. Look, Harry, I am busy with...

			(indicates Liz standing

			there)

				HARRY

		Yeah, you and the rest of the class.

		Every one is busy with Liz.

				LIZ

			(growing impatient)

		Peter?

	A HAND reaches in and smacks her bottom.

				FLASH

		Hiya, cupcakes...

				LIZ

			(elbowing him

			affectionately)

		Flash...!

	They kiss and walk away.

				HARRY

			(sneering)

		And Flash is the busiest of them all...

				PETER

			(disappointed)

		Come on, Harry... we'll be late for

		Octavius.

	HARRY makes a gesture dismissing OCK as crazy.

				HARRY

		Ock is nuts, don't you agree?

				PETER

		Ock is a genius, Harry. Crazy, Yes! But,

		a genius misunderstood, and unappreciated.

	INT. CYCLOTRON AREA HALLWAY - DAY

	It is a basement hallway full of LOCKERS which STUDENTS

	are banging open and shut as they put stuff in and take

	stuff out. In their midst, a MAN is banging on the door

	marked "Cyclotron Room - Authorized Personnel Only!"

	Professor ROSOMORF, SIXTISH, respectable, a good old

	fashioned professor, he's the head of the Physics Dept.

	With him is ALEXANDER THORKEL, a 40-ish, Waspish school

	administrator. For a scientist as crazily focused as OCK,

	THORKEL is a natural enemy.

				ROZ

			(knocking furiously)

		Doctor Octavius! You are late for your

		lecture. The students are waiting.

		Doctor Octavius!

				THORKEL

		Your friend is impossible Professor

		Rosomorf, I told the board we should let

		him go.

	The LIGHT above THORKEL's head EXPLODES. Then all the

	LIGHTS behind him EXPLODE in succession. THORKEL and ROZ

	look amazed...

				THORKEL

		What's he doing in there, not his crazy

		experiment again.

				ROZ

		You mean his anti-force theory... one day

		they'll give him the Nobel Prize for it.

				THORKEL

		Meanwhile he is demolishing our

		university. Octavius!!

			(knocks)

		Open the door.

	INT. OCK'S LAB

				OCK

		The anti-force experiment has now reached

		the limit of electronic overload safety.

		Therefore, Weiner, you will disconnect

		the overload safety device...

	FOUR WALDOS (three-fingered, snake-like mechanical arms)

	suddenly thrust themselves into the CHAMBER and begin

	working, each at a different task. OCK is an acknowledged

	master at manipulating these WALDOS.

	He flicks a switch and a searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM lances

	down from a FOCUSING CONE and strikes a GRAM WEIGHT

	marked, "1,000,000"), illuminating it and filling our

	ears with a splitting BUZZ TONE.

	The knock on the door grows louder.

	WEINER comes up behind OCK.

				WEINER

		Whoa, Doc... someone's at the door...

				OCK

			(ignoring)

		World class scientific mind and they

		stick me in the basement with this third

		rate cyclotron...

	INSERT: The DIAL marked "RELATIVE GRAVITY" reads

	"1,000,000" but suddenly it snaps to "0.999999!"

				OCK

		Okey! Dokey!

	The WEIGHT begins to jiggle and, for an instant, it

	appears to lift ever so slightly.

	INT. COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY

	This is an enormous room, 100 lab tables. The yellowing

	smoke of a thousand experiments hangs in the air. A HUGE

	AMERICAN FLAG dominates the back wall.

	PETER, HARRY and LIZ set up their TABLES. FLASH reads the

	DAILY BUGLE sports section. PETER can't take his eyes off

	LIZ. When she looks back he looks down at his GEAR.

				LIZ

			(softly)

		What is it, Peter?

				PETER

			(embarrassed)

		It's nothing.

	INT. OCK'S LAB

	WEINER opens the door and sees ROZ and THORKEL waiting

	impatient.

				WEINER

		Yes, gentleman can I help you?

				THORKEL

		Tell your boss, that his class is waiting.

				WEINER

			(looks)

		You better tell him yourself.

	THORKEL looks at ROZ who waves his shoulder, then the both

	call.

				ROZ & THORKEL

		Professor Octavius!!

	Professor OCK turns and looks at the bewildered men.

				OCK

		Gentlemen, come, you must see this.

				ROZ

		But, your students...

				OCK

		The imbeciles can wait... I have better

		things to do than teach introductory

		Physics Rosomorf. Undergrads are

		kindless adolescence.

				THORKEL

		You see he is impossible.

				OCK

		Thorkel you are the dummiest

		administrator our university has ever had.

			(Thorkel turns to go)

		Don't go Thorkel!! Come! Look!

	He starts to play his machines handles and buttons.

				THORKEL

		The university pays you to teach

		something to your students.

	INT. COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY

				LIZ

		Well, do you mean nothing... or do you

		mean something but you won't tell me what

		it is?

				PETER

			(regaining)

		I mean plain nothing.

				LIZ

		Well, I guess that's about as nothing as

		you can get... plain nothing.

		A beat.

				PETER

		Liz...!

				LIZ

		Ahh, it is something.

				PETER

		No... look.

	The equipment on her TABLE is starting to vibrate. They

	look at it, curiously. We hear the cyclotron's WHINE

	begin to build...

	INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - DAY

	Everything is shaking like in an earthquake... Roz and

	Thorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with

	anger and surprise. The WHINE is deafening! The light is

	blinding! WEINER has his eyes closed and his hands over

	his ears.

				OCK

		I am going for 20 percent power!

				THORKEL

		NO!! Don't do that...

				ROZ

		Ock! Its dangerous...

				THORKEL

		Ock I warn you...

	WEINER crosses himself. The CONSOLE erupts in sparks.

	INT. ELECTRICAL CONDUIT MONTAGE - DAY

	We follow the electrical overcharge as it crackles along

	the WIRES and CABLES inside the WALLS and FLOORS. It is

	making its way up to the LAB!

	INT. LAB - DAY

	All the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating

	equipment.

	The CHARGE crackles up a WIRE and erupts at LIZ'S TABLE.

	A BREAKER explodes in flames. There is an outburst of AD

	LIBS: "Fire!" "Everybody out!"

	THORKEL (comes running he is shabby and bewildered) seeing

	LIZ trapped behind the fire which is growing from second

	to second.

				THORKEL

		Keep calm, everybody keep calm. Use the

		front door. Everybody out the front.

				PETER

		Liz! Come on...!

				LIZ

		I can't. Help me!

				PETER

		I'm coming!

	He wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the FLAMES.

	His sleeve is on fire. He pats it out.

				LIZ

		Peter!

	Flash appears and tries to help but Thorkel stops him.

				THORKEL

		Get back, you idiots. You can't go in

		there!

	LIZ smashes at the WINDOW, but this is an inner city

	school and the WINDOWS are covered by STEEL GATES. Liz

	wraps her fingers in the GATE.

				LIZ

			(out at the street)

		Help! Help me!

	Outside the WINDOW the air is clear and people come and

	go. Some are stopping to look up at the girl on the

	second floor who screams (but they can't hear, of course)

	down at them as the FLAMES close in behind her.

	PETER comes flying in with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. He

	fumbles with it. FLASH pushes Thorkel, grabs the

	extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain.

	LIZ turns to face the FLAMES. Suddenly there is an

	eruption of CO2 CLOUDS and the roar of a FIRE

	EXTINGUISHER.

	The FLAMES are beaten down enough for her to leap out.

	FLASH is there, holding the EXTINGUISHER. People CHEER.

				PETER

		Thanks for your help Flash.

				FLASH

		No problem wimp.

				PETER

		Our hero has a real way with words.

				LIZ

		Oh, why don't you grow up.

	PETER is stung, insulted, turns away.

	ROSOMORF peeps in, worried -- faces Thorkel.

				THORKEL

		This man will bring a disaster upon this

		university.

	OCK comes in, starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has

	happened.

				OCK

		The universe is made up of forces... and

		counter-forces. Science is the study of

		the forces!

	FLASH hands the EXTINGUISHER to PETER. LIZ embraces

	FLASH, throwing a glimpse at PETER who tried so bravely.

	He looks away and turns the last of the EXTINGUISHER on

	the last of the FIRE.

				OCK

			(continues without a

			hitch)

		But I... Professor Otto Octavius... have

		devoted my life to the study of the

		counter-forces! Good job, Peter.

				PETER

			(taking place at lab

			table)

		Thanks, Professor.

	THORKEL has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the

	front of the huge LAB. He simply cannot believe OCK'S

	behavior.

				THORKEL

		I don't believe it, I simply don't...

				OCK

		Can we carry on Mr. Thorkel.

				THORKEL

		I don't believe... oh, all right carry on

		Professor.

				OCK

		Well! This week my dear students I have

		made a stunning breakthrough...

				THORKEL

		Wait a minute, wait a minute... you've

		got fire forms to fill out, Dr. Octavius.

				OCK

		I have no time for forms, or

		administrators who persist in

		interrupting me, Mr. Thorkel.

	THORKEL steams out and bangs shut the DOOR.

				OCK

		I now believe its possible that these

		counter forces can be... collected... the

		way the magnifying glass collects the

		sunlight... and focused into a hard beam

		I call... Weiner!

	WEINER backs away from the BLACKBOARD to reveal a word

	that OCK has scrawled in large letters. It says "Anti-

	Force."

				OCK

		I call it, the Anti-Force!

	OCK is plugging a HUGE CABLE into a small LUCITE BOX with

	a SILVER BALL inside it.

				OCK

			(continues as he works)

		This anti-force, once harnessed, is

		capable of undoing any natural force at

		which it is aimed... for instance...

			(looks up maniacally)

		Gravity!

	LIZ scribbles down a note and mouths the word "gravity."

	Then she turns to PETER.

				LIZ

			(whispers)

		I'm sorry...

				PETER

		It's alright.

	OCK is "playing" his COMPUTER like the Phantom of the

	Opera at the organ.

				OCK

		We patch in the cyclotron...

		The lights flicker and go dim.

				OCK

		Pay no attention to the lights... I of

		course steal its energy, and it looses

		power. We patch in the cyclotron... and

		we gradually apply power. The power that

		I am stealing...

	As the WHINE builds in the LAB...

	OCK peers through the LUCITE BOX at us, distorted by it.

	The BOX is a miniature version of the cyclotron's

	experimental chamber, and now the BLUE-WHITE glow begins.

	It crackles round the SILVER BALL.

				OCK

		And so we stand, four square against the

		fundamental force that orders and

		maintains our universe... gravity...

		which is holding down this goddamn ball.

		Rise!

	The LIGHTS go totally dark. The kids react with WHOOPS

	and CATCALLS.

				HARRY

		What a crock...

				PETER

		Shut up Harry... this is very interesting.

				OCK

		Mr. Parker! Have you some... interesting

		observation you'd like to share with the

		class?

				PETER

		No sir...

				OCK

		Then shut up! And pay some attention to

		the experiment.

	OCK peers at us through the LUCITE BOX as the SILVER BALL

	begins to rise. OCK'S face is ecstatic.

				OCK

		Rise! Rise!!!

	The SILVER BALL suddenly shoots up, shattering the top of

	the box. It flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a

	LIGHT FIXTURE.

	The shards rain down on OCK who reaches out and catches

	the falling BALL and scales it in a raised fist.

				OCK

		Now that's what I call an experiment!

	The CYCLOTRON WHINE cuts out and OCK wheels to the

	COMPUTER. He hits a KEY and several COLORED PROJECTION

	BEAMS lance out of the back of the room. They pierce the

	smoke and light a PROJECTION DISPLAY in the front.

	TWO COLORED SPHERES one, YELLOW, one BLUE touch where

	their circumferences meet. Behind them is a BLACK

	depiction of "space".

				OCK

		You are looking at a representation of

		two universes. Our Blue one. Our real

		universe... something we can touch and

		feel and see and draw calculations about.

		This is us. The Yellow universe... this

		is something else. Some other dimension...

		something... on the other side!

	OCK hits another COMPUTER KEY and a hole appears where the

	TWO SPHERES touch. The BLUE AND THE YELLOW MARBLEIZE with

	each other. The colors swirl until both SPHERES are

				BRIGHT GREEN.

				OCK

		If it were possible to generate enough

		power behind it, the anti-force could

		wipe out not just gravity... but all our

		universal forces at the same time. In

		effect... it would blast a hole between

		this universe and the next. Each...

			(indicates green spheres)

		would flow into each other. No blue

		universe. No yellow. End, finished,

		over.

				LIZ

			(with a student's ear)

		That sounds like a scenario for the end

		of the world.

				OCK

		My girl, it is! It is. It would mean

		wiping out everything that's known... and

		letting in everything that's unknown.

				FLASH

		Isn't that a little dangerous?

				OCK

		Don't worry yourself, true inter-

		dimensional penetration is still purely

		theoretical, but one day... Maybe very

		near... maybe in the 21st century...

	INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

	PETER, LIZ, FLASH and HARRY all take BOOKS from their

	LOCKERS.

				LIZ

			(whispers to Peter)

		Look, it's just... I don't know... when

		you and Flash go after each other like

		that...

				PETER

			(whispers)

		He's not my type.

				LIZ

		He doesn't have to be.

				PETER

		Check.

				LIZ

		And besides, he's not all bad.

	PETER looks at FLASH who's a few LOCKERS down. FLASH has

	taken a FOOTBALL from his LOCKER and is spinning it on his

	finger with great joy and concentration.

				PETER

		You don't get nicknamed Flash because

		you're a rocket scientist, Liz.

				LIZ

		Give it up, Parker. You'd die for a

		nickname like Flash.

				PETER

		Yeah, of embarrassment.

	KIM comes by and leans seductively by her LOCKER. KIM is

	a ripe one and hot-hot-hot!

				KIM

			(teasing)

		Hey, Flash... I'm scalping a pair of the

		Midnight Madness Wrestling Match tomorrow

		night.

				FLASH

		The Slammies??? I'd kill for that!!!

				KIM

		Would you pay $125?

				FLASH

		Well, uh, I... gee... if... can I tell

		you tomorrow?

				KIM

			(moving on)

		You snooze, you lose. Hiya Liz...

				LIZ

		Kim, you know Peter and Harry? This is

		my new roommate... Kim Nickson.

	KIM is pulling her pet, a foot long SALAMANDER, out of her

	LOCKER. She wraps it around her neck and turns to the

	boys.

	They go bug-eyed!

				KIM

			(interested)

		Hellooo, Peter.

				PETER

			(embarrassed)

		Hi...

				LIZ

		We're going to the Student Reunion

		Meeting. You coming?

	Peter looks at KIM. Wow. Then he looks at LIZ who's

	adjusting herself in a small MIRROR. HARRY jabs him in

	the ribs. Yeah, yeah!

				PETER

			(frustrated)

		I can't... I gotta go over to the Daily

		Bugle. I'm trying to sell some photos.

				KIM

		Soooh, a photographer...?

				PETER

		Just an amateur. Well... nice meeting

		you, Kim.

				KIM

		Yeah... I bet it would be.

				HARRY

		Can I be your date for the reunion

		ShooShoo?

				KIM

		No Jerk!

				HARRY

			(she turns to go)

		What did I say...

				LIZ

		It's not what you said, it's how you say

		it, ShooShoo!

	Everybody leaves and Harry is left alone, he throws his

	bag down.

				HARRY

		Damn!

	PETER turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking

	WEINER.

				WEINER

		Peter, Doc Ock wants to see you.

				PETER

		About my data I bet.

				WEINER

		I don't know.

				PETER

		He knows about my work on the Planetary

		Conjunction, doesn't he?

				WEINER

			(lies)

		I don't know.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	PETER enters wide-eyed behind WEINER. This place is a far

	cry from the experiment in the LAB ROOM. It's a fantastic

	netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance. No one

	but PETER.

	OCK is sitting in a swivel CHAIR with his back to PETER.

	He has the look of Captain Nemo in his Nautilus. This is

	OCK'S domain.

				PETER

		Hello, Professor Octavius.

			(no response)

		I really admired your experiment.

				OCK

			(back to Peter)

		We have a lot of interests in common,

		Peter. Perhaps we should put our heads

		together, if you know what I mean...

				PETER

			(flattered)

		That would be... great.

				OCK

			(turns with a smile)

		Now you take the Planetary Conjunction.

		This Saturday night we will witness

		Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, the Earth, the

		Sun... all in a row. Never seen within

		the memory of man, or measured for its

		effect. The total gravitational force

		must be quite exceptional. Isn't that

		the subject of your paper...?

				PETER

		Yes sir, I've worked out a new way to

		calculate the combined gravitational

		effect.

				OCK

		I'm a busy man, Mr. Parker. But I think

		I could find the time to go over it with

		you. Make sure it all... checks out.

				PETER

		Well... I'm sort of working with

		Professor Rosomorf and he suggested we

		kind of keep it between us. He thinks

		that my theory is... well, I don't know...

				OCK

			(to himself)

		The scoundrel...

			(turns angry)

		I want to see that data, Peter!

				PETER

		But Professor Octavius... if I knew you

		were interested... sorry, I've already

		given it to... Professor Rosomorf, and he

		is after all the head of our Physics

		Department... and I couldn't...

	OCK turns sweet again. He smiles too broadly.

				OCK

		Well, I'm certain something can be worked

		out. Run along, young man.

	PETER begins to leave.

				OCK

		Just a minute... how about if I show you

		my discoveries... something I never

		showed to any other student... as a

		matter of fact to anybody at all.

				PETER

		Well I am really flattered, I mean I'd

		love to... but I...

				OCK

		Very well shall we say if you come here

		tonight...

				PETER

		But Professor I don't now if I should...

				OCK

		Make it eight sharp... I'll be waiting

		for you... Right here...

	Peter looks worried then leaves.

	OCK turns to WEINER who slouches against the wall smiling.

				OCK

		The same academic world that's so keen to

		embrace that boy's undergraduate work,

		ridicules my anti-force theory as

		quackery. I ask you, Weiner... what is

		our society coming to? Ha!

				WEINER

		They are all a bunch of brainless

		assholes, that's what I say...

				OCK

		Weiner! Go get me that boy's data!

				WEINER

		Cost you fifty bucks.

				OCK

			(Weiner hissing)

		Just get it. We'll negotiate your fee

		when you have the data, alright Weiner?

	EXT. DAILY BUGLE - DAY

	Establish as ART DECO BUILDING well beyond its prime. A

	sign says: "The Daily Bugle." Peter enters the building.

				JAMESON (V.O.)

		Garbage! Absolute, 100% garbage!

	INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY

	Very forties, very messy. J. Jameson scans some PHOTOS as

	PETER stands helplessly by.

				JAMESON

		Bag ladies. I hate bag ladies.

				PETER

		Yes, sir.

	JAMESON is 50ish, grey at the temples, brush cut on top.

	He too is forties. His chewed up CIGAR is forties. This

	guy is a hard case.

				JAMESON

			(looks at the other photos)

		Little kids... I hate little kids. This

		is a daily newspaper. We need news value

		photographs, not artsy-fartsy shit!

				PETER

		Yes, sir.

	JAMESON comes to a picture of a BUSINESS SUITED MAN with a

	MOHAWK. PETER smiles in anticipation.

				JAMESON

		Kid? You want a pro's assessment?

				PETER

		Yes, sir!

				JAMESON

			(handing photos back)

		Your photos suck.

			(cigar for emphasis)

		Parker, my readers are morons. I gotta

		grab them by the eyes. Every time you

		press the button of that Nikon of yours

		it costs you fifty-five cents. So the

		next time you're about to take the plunge,

		ask yourself, am I taking dog bites man?

		Because if you are...

				PETER

		I know, I know. You want man bites dog...

				JAMESON

		Parker, this is the post modern 20th

		century. I want man eats dog! Get out!

	EXT. STREET - DAY

	A seedy east village walk up. Peter takes his camera and

	takes various shots of a wino. ALL IN. He climbs the

	stairs to his building, looks through the mail, he

	collects from a beaten down mailbox.

				PETER

			(reading)

		Rent! Rent, more bills, rent...

		electricity, bills...

	INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - DAY

	A one-room, shabby roof apartment, a chaos of books and

	papers. A photo enlarger and darkroom baths in kitchen

	pots; 8x10s tacked to the walls; a spare camera and

	lenses. Self-consciously wacky kitsch; plastic dinosaurs,

	wind-up toys, a stuffed carp. An unmade bed and a 50's

	dinette set are the only furniture. A grimy skylight

	leads to the roof. It's not a pretty place, but it has

	personality. A voice from the kitchen, a shadow of an

	intruder, is sneaking around.

				PETER

		There's nothing in there worth stealing!

				MAY (V.O.)

			(from within the kitchen)

		That's the understatement of the year.

				PETER

		Aunt May, you're trespassing.

				MAY

			(comes in)

		I was just so desperately bored... I

		thought I'd come over and make you dinner...

				PETER

		I am old enough to... to make my own--

				MAY

		But I didn't feel like getting to know

		your roaches.

				PETER

		I'll introduce you.

				MAY

		Oh. And those foul chemicals in the pots...

				PETER

		I take pictures, remember?

				MAY

		Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for

		dinner in Forest Hills...

	She grabs her coat, crosses back to Peter and tugs on his

	shoulder.

				PETER

		It's Friday night...

				MAY

		Yes. Do you have a date?

				PETER

		No.

				MAY

		Then come on.

	INT. LARGE COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT

	It is dark and empty except for COMPUTERS. Sitting at it,

	lit by the GLOW of its screen, is SOLOMON ROSOMORF (ROZ).

	As he works, a DOOR opens behind him. Someone walks

	quietly through the LAB. ROSOMORF keeps working. The

	intruder approaches...

				THORKEL

			(at his ear)

		Professor Rosomorf, what happened here?

				ROZ

		Someone tried to rob me of some paper...

		I suspect they were looking for that one.

				THORKEL

		What is it?

				ROZ

			(unruffled)

		Award winning stuff.

			(turning slightly)

		Peter Parker's data on the Planetary

		Conjunction. Damn lucky I hid it in my

		computer under another title.

				THORKEL

		My God, what's going on in our school?

		First Professor Octavius almost blows up

		the Physics lab... Now this. You report

		it in triplicate, of course.

				ROZ

		Thorkel, be careful when you talk to

		Octavius. Remember... the man is a very

		fragile genius. One day he'll bring us

		all the Noble Prize.

				THORKEL

		Rosomorf, the man is a very dangerous

		crackpot!

	Off screen the voice of the CYCLOTRON WHINE begins to

	build.

				ROZ

		That's him again. He's working day and

		night.

				THORKEL

		I tell you the man is very dangerous.

			(the whine grows louder)

		Come on Rosomorf, let's stop him before

		this building will explode.

	INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK and WEINER are at work as before. OCK takes no notice

	of the TWO MEN who come in, nor the WORKER who comes in

	behind them and sets to work attaching a BIG LOCK to the

	door.

				THORKEL

		Shut it down, Octavius.

	OCK ignores him. WEINER touches OCK'S shoulder. OCK

	ignores him too.

				THORKEL

		You've blown half the circuits in the

		Science Center.

				OCK

		Call an electrician.

				THORKEL

		I have called the locksmith.

				OCK

		What... what is he doing.

	He points toward the worker who's working on the lock on

	the main door.

				THORKEL

		We have to shut your lab down and take a

		look at the lines.

				ROZ

		Please, Otto, we must lock it up.

				OCK

			(to Thorkel)

		You're denying me access to my cyclotron?!

				THORKEL

		You bet.

	OCK glares back and forth between the TWO MEN, the WORKER,

	and WEINER. Then he pulls BACK the RED POWER THROTTLE.

	The WHINE descends.

	The WALDOS pull back and dangle from their panel. The

	WHINE dies.

				OCK

			(contemplating)

		Okey, dokey... just give me till tomorrow.

		I want to clean up my papers. Tomorrow...

		Ha... Tomorrow you can have this room...

				ROZ

		Oh... well Thorkel... few more hours

		won't make a difference.

				THORKEL

		I hope.

	He signals to the worker to stop.

	INT. APARTMENT OF AUNT MAY AND UNCLE BEN - NIGHT

	The N.Y. Mets are playing baseball on T.V. PETER watches

	with his UNCLE BEN, a paunchy 65 years old in POLYESTER

	SLACKS and a COMFY OLD SWEATER. A N.Y. METS CAP is

	perched on BEN'S head. A BEER CAN is in his hand. A

	cluttered but familiar living room sprawls comfortably

	around them.

				BEN

		Another brewski?

				PETER

		No, I'm fine, Uncle Ben.

				BEN

			(at T.V.)

		Yah! Way to do it. Alright!

			(to Peter)

		You don't follow the Mets like you used

		to, do you, Pete?

				PETER

		No, not so much anymore.

				BEN

		Funny. When your Mom and Dad, uh, passed

		away... I had this idea... I wanted you

		to be the best baseball player that ever

		was. Geez, what ever happened to that?

				PETER

		Little league.

				BEN

			(soft and warm)

		Yeah... Babe Ruth you wasn't.

	AUNT MAY enters.

				AUNT MAY

		It's on the table! Turn off the TV!

	BEN nods, rises sluggishly and slowly, and turns the sound

	off only. PETER moves toward his AUNT in the doorway.

				AUNT MAY

		How's that girl you told us about, Peter?

				PETER

		Liz? She's great... But she has a

		boyfriend.

	INT. THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	PETER passes AUNT MAY and takes his seat.

				AUNT MAY

		A boy your age should have a girlfriend.

				PETER

		Aunt May... she has a steady boyfriend.

				AUNT MAY

		Peter, any girl that's worth your

		attention is of course gonna have a

		boyfriend... But if she really gets to

		know what you have to offer she'll... you

		get my drift?

				BEN

		Look, just leave him alone, okay. When

		he's ready for girls he'll be a holy

		terror.

			(winks)

		It's in the blood.

			(now serious business)

		Lookit, how are you fixed for money,

		Pete? Maybe I can help you out a little.

				PETER

			(lying to them)

		No, I'm alright. My scholarship covers

		almost everything, and I sell some photos

		here and there. Today my physics

		professor asked for some of my work... he

		wants to study my data. They might

		publish my work in the science magazine...

		that'll bring me some money...

				BEN

			(practically cheering)

		Publish your work?! You hear that May...?

				PETER

			(embarrassed laughs)

		Yeah, in fact I have to leave a little

		early tonight, to meet Professor

		Octavius... He offered me to be his

		assistant...

				BEN

		Whoa! Did you hear that May...?

				AUNT MAY

		Oh, Peter, you promised you'd spend the

		night...

				PETER

		I... I can't, Aunt May. Professor

		Octavius wants to discuss my new

		findings.

				AUNT MAY

			(disappointed)

		Peter, what you should be finding... is a

		nice girlfriend.

	INT. BASEMENT CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

	WEINER is eating a large SANDWICH and a drinking a COKE.

				OCK

		I'll show them... closing the cyclotron

		on me... Weiner!

				WEINER

		Yes, Professor...

				OCK

		Where is he? It's ten past eight o'clock...

	A KNOCK

				WEINER

			(with mouth full)

		That must be him.

		He opens the door.

				PETER

		Good evening.

				OCK

		You are late.

			(to Weiner)

		Weiner, go outside and get us something

		to eat. And don't steal it! Just buy it.

		I'll reimburse you.

				WEINER

			(to Peter)

		Do you want anything Parker?

				PETER

		No thank you, I just had dinner at my

		aunt's...

				OCK

		Piss off, Weiner!

	WEINER leaves. PETER wanders around.

	He goes into the experimental chamber, he overlooks the

	SPIDER which is scuttling away and crawls inside the open

	WINDOW... and into the chamber.

				OCK

		Okey, dokey, Parker... how would you like

		to take Weiner's place... I mean, be my

		assistant?

				PETER

		Well, Professor, that would be a great

		honor, but I'm already working with...

				OCK

		Rosomorf... that imbecile. Don't you

		understand, kid, that I am about to

		uncover the greatest discovery since

		Einstein came up with his theory of

		relativity... The "Anti-Force."

				PETER

		Wow! The theory of the Anti-force! You

		should go for the Noble Prize Professor...

				OCK

		Noble Shmoble, I am going for a much

		bigger prize kid. Okey, dokey. Let me

		show you, kid, what I got here.

	OCK begins the experiment. We move in past the shattered

	WINDOW. We see the SPIDER crawling on the chamber's GEAR.

				OCK

		Present maximum anti-force power to date

		is 38 percent of theoretical limit. I

		have patched in the variable

		particle-wave accelerator...

			(shrugs)

		I will now try to reach 50% power...

			(big breath)

		And if your paper has any value... I can

		use it to get the power I'm missing to

		create the anti-force, to break through

		and beat any other form of power in our

		or any other universe, capish!

				PETER

		Sorry, Professor, I can't do it. I gave

		my word to Professor Rosomorf.

	OCK is angry... Ock now sees the SPIDER. He shoots out a

	WALDO to try and crush it but the SPIDER is too fast. The

	WALDO slams against the wall of the chamber. He starts to

	push every button or switch in sight. A deafening whining

	starts.

	An URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the "Relative

	Gravity" DIAL. It is at "4.999999KG" but suddenly the

	numbers start to tumble rapidly.

	INSERT: The glowing 5KG WEIGHT.

	INSERT: The POWER DIAL inches toward 50% POWER!

				OCK

			(screaming)

		50 percent... anti-force... 50 percent...

		that's all I'm missing! Parker, we can

		be rich together!

				PETER

		Sorry... I'd better go now.

				OCK

			(really angry now)

		You'll be sorry, Parker.

	PETER leaves.

	Another URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the

	monitor SCREEN. On it, flashing RED, is the word,

	"OVERLOAD!" OCK pushes the RED POWER THROTTLE forward!

	The WHINE increases to a PULSE and THROB.

	INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Incredibly lit, the SPIDER is dropping on it's shimmering

	WEB-STRAND down toward the 5KG WEIGHT which now GLOWS in

	time with the THROB and PULSE.

	INT. THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The MONITOR is flashing "MAXIMUM OVERLOAD - SHUT DOWN!"

	OCK continues with the experiment. And then he sees the

	SPIDER!

				OCK

		You! Get out of there, you creeping...

	He tries to shove the SPIDER with his hand.

	INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Through the BLUE-WHITE we can barely make out OCK on the

	other side if the shattered WINDOW. He sends TWO WALDOS

	after the SPIDER. The SPIDER evades him and jumps onto

	the PROFESSOR's back. It then climbs onto the PROFESSOR's

	neck and bites him.

				OCK

			(anguish)

		Noooooooooooo!

	The gravity DIAL goes to .000001, then pops back up as

	OCK'S tiny world goes berserk. DIALS spin, crack, explode

	or droop liquidly. WIRES dance on the CONSOLE which

	erupts like the 4th of JULY.

	OCK begins to float. His shirt begins to tear away. A

	DIAL floats by with its pulled WIRES undulating like a

	Medusa. WALDOS smash through the walls and flail like

	snakes. OCK'S YELLOW THERMOS distorts and EXPLODES!

	OCK, his hair wild, face locked in a multi-G grimace, is

	pinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with

	SPARKS.

				OCK

			(ecstasy above the din)

		It's an energy storm! Okey! Dokey!

	We see clearly the SPIDER still stuck to his neck.

	The big beast buffets and shakes. Tubes, junctions,

	valves and whatnot fall off, crashing to the floor where

	they twitch and writhe with a life of their own.

	Then, an enormous EXPLOSION rips a large hole in the

	CYCLOTRON's side, sending debris and a HUNDRED MICRO-

	STREAMS of ELECTRONIC PARTICLES lancing in our direction.

	INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Ultimate weirdness! The PULSING BLUE-WHITE LIGHT

	penetrates first the DOOR of the CYCLOTRON ROOM and then

	the very walls! LOCKERS bang, LAMPS POP, the ceiling sags

	in a SURREAL, RUBBERY way.

	The WALLS sag too! The CYCLOTRON SIGN pivots and embeds

	itself in a WALL. A LADDER sinks in the WALL. The BLUE-

	WHITE LIGHT dances wildly about in PULSES. Then,

	suddenly, it stops... DEAD SILENCE. WEINER comes running

	in holding a double decker sandwich and a large bottle of

	Pepsi. Weiner enters OCK'S lab, singing, not at first

	noticing what's going on. Suddenly he stops dead.

	INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

	A scene out of DALI's surrealistic canvas. There are

	things inside of other things. DIALS look like DALI

	watches. This place has been rippled to the max!

	OCK lays face up, unconscious on the floor, a WALDO across

	his chest. The SPIDER is weaving its web. CAMERA slowly

	DOWN to see OCK. PIPES and WIRES are stuck to his body.

	The WALDO seems to be wrapping him. He wakes up to see

	those MECHANICAL ARMS buried in his body. They weave

	around him as if they are looking for prey. He tries to

	tear them out, but they seem to be a part of his body,

	like his other limbs. He screams. Suddenly Weiner sees

	OCK.

				WEINER

		Professor... what happened to you? What

		did you do...

	Suddenly one of the waldos hits him so strongly that he

	flies back and out through the door to the corridor.

	INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

				WEINER

		Oh my God... what happened here...

	He hears the police sirens approaching, he runs away.

				WEINER

		I better get out of here.

	EXT. THE EMPIRE UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

	The long SCREAM segues to a POLICE SIREN. A COP CAR pulls

	to a halt in front of the COLLEGE. Many NYPD CARS are

	already there, along with a NUCLEAR REGULATORY VAN, some

	AMBULANCES, a VAN from the ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

	and TWO TV VANS. ROZ runs across the lawn.

	POLICE STRUGGLE to hold back the crowd of press, students

	and general gawkers.

	J. JAMESON pushes to the front of the mob in time to see

	TWO COPS hustle a BUGLE PHOTOGRAPHER back into it.

	The MAN shakes his head. JAMESON throws down his CIGAR,

	stomps it, and pulls out a fresh one. THORKEL arrives to

	address the CROWD.

				THORKEL

			(through bull horn)

		There is no danger. Please go back to

		your dorms. I repeat, there is no danger.

				JAMESON

			(approaches him)

		Spill it out, Professor! The public

		wants to know!

	The CROWD closes on THORKEL.

				THORKEL

		Who are you?

				JAMESON

		Jameson, Daily Bugle, Chief Editor, now

		what really happened here?

				THORKEL

		There will be a press announcement in the

		morning Mr. Jameson... now if you'll

		excuse me.

	This elicits a flood of AD LIBS: "I heard a terrible

	explosion?" "Nuclear accidents?" "Meltdown?" "Genetic

	engineering?" "Are you guys making mutants in there?"

				THORKEL

		I have nothing to say... there will be an

		announcement. Now, please go home...

		everybody... we must clear the grounds...

	In the back of the crowd are PETER, HARRY, LIZ, FLASH and

	KIM.

				FLASH

		You think they'll cancel classes?

				HARRY

		They must... the whole building must be

		contaminated with some kind of poisonous

		gas.

				PETER

		How about nuclear contaminations?

				KIM

		My God... lets beat it.

		But nobody moves.

				LIZ

			(more interested in other

			things)

		Could anyone be in there, Peter?

				PETER

			(concerned)

		I don't know... Maybe Professor Octavius.

		He usually works late...

				FLASH

		That nut, I bet it was all his doing...

				JAMESON

			(seeing Peter)

		Hey Parker! Peter Parker!

	PETER pushes forward.

				PETER

		Mr. Jameson! What are you doing here?

		What's going on?

				JAMESON

		That's for them to know, and for you to

		find out.

				PETER

		But sir, they wouldn't tell us. You

		heard Thorkel... he said...

				JAMESON

		A press announcement tomorrow...! But we

		must know tonight Parker. This is your

		university, right...

				PETER

		Yes, but...

				JAMESON

		You got your camera?

				PETER

		Sure, but I can't--

				JAMESON

		A hundred dollars says you can?

				PETER

		Yes sir!

				JAMESON

		Get inside and get pictures, fifty bucks.

				PETER

		You just said a hundred.

				JAMESON

		Seventy, but I want blood and gore.

				PETER

			(calling back)

		Seeya guys.

	He dashes off. FLASH shakes his head in dismay at this

	guy.

				LIZ

		Where is he going?

				JAMESON

		To make fifty bucks.

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	PETER approaches a CYCLONE FENCE keeping low and out of

	sight. He leaps it like a skirmisher but fails

	ignominiously in a heap. He's torn his PANTS and cut his

	leg. He moves to the side of the building.

	A DUMPSTER sits next to a FIRE DOOR. It's locked. As

	PETER mulls over his next move, the LOCK clicks and the

	DOOR slowly opens. PETER leaps on the DUMPSTER... and

	falls in.

	INT. DUMPSTER - NIGHT

	PETER lays in the GARBAGE, a pained look on his face. He

	rolls over and comes face to face with a wet DAILY BUGLE.

	The headline reads, "Wave of Violence Rips City!" He pulls

	himself up and peers out.

	He sees a UNIFORMED GUARD hold the DOOR open for THREE MEN

	IN RADIATION SUITS who remove some weirdly fused objects.

	When they let the DOOR swing closed, PETER stops it by

	inserting the NEWSPAPER in the top.

	EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

	PETER squeezes inside and jumps to knock out the

	NEWSPAPER. The Door closes behind him.

	INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Skewed, strange, surreal, PETER stares at the weirdness

	and fumbles with his CAMERA. He snaps off a few shots,

	then freezes when he hears a familiar voice.

				ROZ (V.O.)

			(filtered through face mask)

		Take it easy. Take it easy with him.

				THORKEL (V.O.)

		Take him away and never bring him back!

	Now we see ROZ and THORKEL following 2 GUARDS carrying OCK

	in a stretcher. They all wear RADIATION SUITS. A waldo

	sneaks out from under the sheet and hits Thorkel, as fast

	as lightning. He falls back. He's covered with a SHEET

	and attached to LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. Octavius moans.

				THORKEL

		What was that?

				ROZ

		What was what?

				THORKEL

		What hit me?

				ROZ

		What hit you?

				THORKEL

		I don't know. It was so fast.

				ROZ

		You're going to be fine, Otto.

	PETER gets off a shot and ducks into the MEN'S room

	leaving the DOOR ajar for a peak.

	A WALDO slips down from the SHEET. PETER'S eyes go wide

	at the sight. What in the hell has happened here?

	INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	The URINALS are twisted in bizarre shapes. PIPES are

	exposed and spout WATER. The MIRRORS look like something

	out of a funhouse. PETER hears the STRETCHER go by.

	PETER goes to the DOOR of OCK'S Lab and cracks it. PAN up

	to the SPIDER, GLOWING softly, dangling from a SHIMMERING

	STRAND above PETER.

	As PETER looks out at the STRETCHER, the SPIDER drops on

	his neck. He reacts by swatting it away. Bad move.

	The GLOWING SPIDER now squats malevolently on the back of

	PETER's hand. He stares at it transfixed. It bites.

				PETER

		Ow!!!

	PETER throws the SPIDER to the ripply tile floor where it

	scuttles unsteadily out the door.

	Sweat starts to bead on PETER'S face. He shakes his head

	to clear it. His vision becomes uncertain. He lurches

	against a WEIRD SINK.

	PETER'S POV is not just uncertain, not just fuzzy, not

	just moving in and out anamorphically. It's all of that!

				GUARD (V.O.)

			(heavily distorted)

		Hey! What are you doing here, kid?

	PETER turns to see a UNIFORMED GUARD distorted by his

	crazy vision.

				PETER

		I feel a little funny...

				GUARD

			(heavily distorted)

		Yeah? Well, I ain't laughing. Get out...

		Just get out of here...

	EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

	It bangs open. The GUARD throws PETER out and then throws

	his BACK PACK at him.

				GUARD

			(still distorted)

		You get yourself over to the Police lines.

				PETER

			(ultra wooz)

		Right. Police lines.

	EXT. UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

	PETER melds into the crowd. As in a dream, JAMESON

	appears at his side.

				JAMESON

			(distorted)

		Okay, scoop, whaddaya got?

				PETER

		I... got pictures of the Professor... in

		there... it's so strange in there... so

		bizarre...

				JAMESON

			(winks)

		Good job, kid. Bizarre is what we need.

		Pick this up in the morning.

			(holding up his camera)

		There'll be two crisp twenties tucked

		inside.

	He hurries off. PETER peers after him and all of a sudden

	his vision corrects to a perfect focus. The sweat is

	gone. He's okay. He makes his way through the crowd to

	the street.

	We TRACK with PETER as the madding throng recedes behind

	him. He turns a corner. He hears a SIREN.

	An AMBULANCE screeches around the corner. It nearly hits

	PETER who leaps to avoid it.

	EXT. BRICK BUILDING - NIGHT

	PETER'S cheek is pressed against the brick. He opens his

	eyes and sees that he's hanging onto the side of the

	building like a spider. And he's three stories up!

	He looks down and sees the street thirty feet below him!

	And the Ambulance which he jumped over is driving away.

	He tries a downward step, but a BRICK dislodges and

	crashes to the sidewalk. He takes an upward step. And

	then another.

	Tentatively at first, and then with growing confidence, he

	"crawls" to the roof of the building. At the top he

	gropes for a RAILING and slips. He dangles eight stories

	above the street. Then, with a grunt, he vaults to the

	roof one-handed.

	EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

	PETER is flat on his back, staring at the stars. He sits

	up and looks wonderingly at his hands.

	On the back of his right hand are TWO PUNCTURE WOUNDS

	surrounded by a faint BLUE-WHITE PULSING GLOW. The GLOW

	disappears.

				PETER

			(mutters to himself)

		This is weird. My God, I feel so weird...

	He leaps to his feet. He flexes. Feels weird. Good

	Weird. In fact, great weird! He tries a couple of

	"jumping jacks" and on the third jump he soars into the

	air!

				PETER

			(exhilarated)

		Very weird.

	The great, bespangled, NEW YORK CITY is his backdrop as

	PETER jumps and turns and does loops in the air.

	With the agility and tactility of a spider, PETER leaps

	from the RAILING to a WALL to a FLAG POLE to another WALL

	where he lands sideways and sticks.

				PETER

			(sideways)

		Very, very weird.

	He leaps off the WALL and lands at the edge of the roof.

	He looks down. No one's looking back. So, he takes a

	step back and leaps the alley to the next roof.

	EXT. ROOFTOP SHACK - NIGHT

	PETER lands on it. The next roof is seven stories up and

	across the street. PETER bites his lip.

				PETER

		Well, what the hell!!

	EXT. THE TALLER BUILDING - NIGHT

	Backlit by a FULL MOON, PETER somersaults to the roof of

	the taller building, and misses the top!

	He sticks to the brick FACADE, upside down! He laughs

	with the moment. A WINDOW opens below him and a pretty

	BLONDE in a TOWEL sticks her head out. She looks this way

	and that, and all she sees is a MAN in a LOUD SPORTCOAT

	down the street. Never thinking to look up, she withdraws

	into the room.

	EXT. CHELSEA STREET - NIGHT

	The MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT leans against a LAMP POST

	and lights a CIGARETTE with a BEAT UP, SILVER PLATED

	LIGHTER.

	In the LIGHTER he sees a reflection of PETER leaping off

	the taller building. He snaps around and looks up in time

	to see PETER make it to the next FACADE.

	EXT. ROOFTOP MONTAGE - NIGHT

	With the UPTOWN SKYLINE behind him, PETER casts caution to

	the wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop.

	Watching from the street, the MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT

	follows PETER'S progress.

	PETER leaps to a BROWNSTONE and lands amid the WASH.

	He leaps up to a TENEMENT and lands on a BILLBOARD across

	which he does a "bug crawl" and leaps again.

	He touches down on a PIGEON COOP and bounds up and out of

	frame again. The COOP OWNER, a LATINO in an undershirt

	and a YANKEES CAP, comes running out of the COOP.

	He's so surprised that he leaves the DOOR open and twenty

	WHITE MORNING DOVES fly away in a furious flapping, free

	at last. The LATINO lets out a stream of Hispanic

	expletives complete with all the appropriately obscene

	gestures.

	PETER slides down a CABLE to a LAMP POST, and swirls down

	the POLE to a PHONE BOOTH.

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

	PETER comes face to face with the man in the LOUD

	SPORTCOAT. He gives PETER his CARD.

				REISS

		You're a kid who's going places, and I'm

		gonna point you the right way.

				PETER

			(reading card)

		Max Reiss, models, strip dancers, escort

		girls, blue movies...

				REISS

		Oops... sorry, wrong card.

			(exchanges cards)

				PETER

		Max Reiss, Talent management.

				REISS

		It's a big outfit. Got a lot of

		departments.

				PETER

		Yeah... well... why you approach me? I'm

		not...

				REISS

		Oh yes you are... very talented. The

		three questions of show business success.

		One do you think you possess a unique

		talent?

				PETER

		Well...

				REISS

		Two... what are you gonna do with it?

				PETER

			(not a clue)

		Well... I don't know.

				REISS

			(the clincher)

		Three... how much money you got in your

		pocket?

				PETER

		Ten.

				REISS

		You invest half of that with me and I'll

		make you a star.

				PETER

			(laughing)

		What are you talking about?

				REISS

		I'm talking about fame. I'm talking

		about fortune. I'm talking about the

		chance of a lifetime. How'd you like to

		be on MTV tomorrow night?

				PETER

		MTV...? Me? Really?

				REISS

		Taxi!

	It screeches to a stop.

				PETER

		Hey!

				REISS

			(getting in)

		Kid! Tomorrow night. Same place, same

		time.

				PETER

			(calling after)

		How do you know I'll show up?

	As the TAXI roars off...

				REISS

			(from the taxi window)

		Because you wanna be a star... everybody

		does.

	PETER pulls out a QUARTER. And enters a phone booth. He

	dials.

				PETER

		Hello? Aunt May?

				AUNT MAY (V.O.)

			(filtered)

		Peter? What time is it? Are you alright?

				PETER

		Well, no, I mean yeah I'm fine, but

		listen... Aunti, the craziest thing

		happened to me tonight.

	INT./ EXT. PHONE BOOTH/AUNT MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As UNCLE BEN stirs fitfully

				AUNT MAY

			(lovingly)

		Does this have to do with a certain girl

		we talked about at dinner?

				PETER

		No, no, look, there was this radioactive

		experiment... I was poisoned!

				AUNT MAY

		You were what?

				PETER

		I was bitten by a bug.

				AUNT MAY

		Oh! I get it, you mean a love bug.

				PETER

		No... No... A spider...

				AUNT MAY

		Peter, did you at least talk to her?

				PETER

		Aunt May, listen to me. I got bitten on

		the hand... by a poisonous spider.

				AUNT MAY

		She bit you?

				PETER

		No. I was in the bathroom and...

				AUNT MAY

		Oh, you did it in the bathroom? Peter,

		this is craziness, why don't you use your

		bed? You're up all night. You're in the

		radioactive labs. You never take time to

		eat or sleep. Am I right?

				PETER

		Yes, Aunt May.

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

				AUNT MAY (V.O.)

		Did you eat something today?

				PETER

		Yes, Aunt May.

				AUNT MAY (V.O.)

		Okay, Peter go back to bed, and remember

		we love you.

				PETER

		And I love you too, Aunt May.

			(hangs up)

		And by the way, I got a mess of super

		powers today.

	Exit booth. He BANGS the PHONE BOOTH. Goes out and--

	jumps lightly onto the phone booth roof.

	INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK is prepped for surgery. GOWNED PERSONNEL hurry about

	with a feverish urgency. The CHIEF SURGEON checks the

	SENSORS attached to OCK'S head. These seasoned

	professionals are astonished and frightened.

				CHIEF SURGEON

			(whispers)

		Look at these brainwave readings. The

		mental activity is ten times of any

		normal man...!

				BRAINMAN

			(whispers)

		Equipment malfunction...?

				CHIEF SURGEON

			(whispers)

		Hell, yeah... his.

			(checks Ock's chest)

		My God... I thought I'd seen everything...

				SURGEON #2

			(whispers)

		But this is beyond medicine. This is

		madness...!

	OCK lays bare chested, face up, all FOUR WALDOS splayed.

	He is a true cyborg. Part man, part machine. Part

	organic, part molybdenum steel.

				NURSE

			(leaning in, blitzed)

		It is so freaky...

				CHIEF SURGEON

			(stern for the staff's

			sake)

		Okay, lets stop yakking and get cracking.

		I want to go in at the upper thoracic.

		Then we'll work our way around.

			(slaps Ock's shoulder)

		Hang in there, man.

	INSERT: The WALDO nearest the slap moves ever so slightly.

	The triangular CLAW rotates a quarter turn and then turns

	back.

	The NURSE sees it and SCREAMS.

				CHIEF SURGEON

			(glares)

		Nurse! Number seven scalpel.

		Arthroscope stand by. Read out

		parameters in progress. Let's go in.

		You alright?

				NURSE

		Yes... Yes, of course. Everything's

		online.

				CHIEF SURGEON

		Scalpel! No... no... a larger one...

		the largest we have!

	She slaps a HUGE ONE into his palm. He takes a deep

	breath and goes to work. MASKED heads gather round him.

	The SCALPEL is poised at the line where skin meets steel.

	We make an incision. The INSTRUMENTS go crazy. WARNING

	BELLS and BUZZERS sound.

				HEAD NURSE

		Kill the alarms!

				BRAINMAN

		He's going off the chart!

	A WALDO flashes around the steel leg of the operating

	TABLE and clanks tight!

				CHIEF SURGEON

		Mop. Mop! Sutures and clamps! Hurry up!

				SURGEON #2

		We're losing him. Defibrillate!

	A HEART MACHINE is rushed in. They work frantically.

				CHIEF SURGEON

		Zap him!

				BRAINMAN

		Stabilizing alpha waves...

	SURGEON #2 applies the CARDIAC SHOCK PADS.

	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

				NURSE

		You have a visitor, Doctor...

	She leaves OCK and THORKEL alone.

				THORKEL

			(enjoying this)

		Octavius, I'm afraid I have bad news for

		you.

				OCK

		The cyclotron is damaged...

				THORKEL

		What used to be the cyclotron was

		permanently shut down this afternoon.

				OCK

		But my work!

				THORKEL

		Your work is a disaster! Look at

		yourself!

				OCK

		Myself? I don't matter. Nobody matters

		anymore. To enter a new dimension we

		must first destroy our own...

				THORKEL

		What are you saying?

	OCK gets off his bed throwing away his sheet waving with

	his 4 WALDOS and 2 arms.

				OCK

		Destroy life. Life is... insignificant.

		Bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh. What

		would you say?

				THORKEL

		Oh, my God, what are those horrible

		things sticking from your body?

				OCK

			(gets more and more excited)

		Thorkel, if I told you that for one

		moment in time I broke all the laws! For

		one brief glorious moment, I broke

		through to the other side. I saw... I

		felt... I became creation.

				THORKEL

		What on Earth are you rambling about?

				OCK

		Destiny!!! My destiny! I see it all so

		clearly now. Universal destruction, yes.

		All I need is the power... then I can

		destroy this illusion you call life. It

		is my destiny to lead us to the light!

				THORKEL

		You're a madman.

				OCK

		And you are a fool. I will end the

		universe as you know it. And in that

		final moment... I'll laugh my ass off

		while you're kissing yours goodbye!

				THORKEL

			(excited)

		Goodbye is right, Octavius... You're

		fired... sacked... canned. You are

		history, Doctor Octavius. And I couldn't

		be more pleased to be the first to tell

		you this good news...

	A WALDO shoots up and grabs THORKEL by the throat. He

	GASPS and SCREAMS silently as the telescoping WALDO lifts

	him off his feet. He rises until his head is just inches

	from the ceiling.

				THORKEL

			(his last words)

		Let me down Ock... you crazy... MONSTER!

		Let me down!

	Then OCK smiles and slams THORKEL'S head through the

	ceiling. PLASTER rains down. THORKEL'S legs scissor and

	kick and then go limp. OCK throws his dead body on to the

	bed, and covers him with the WHITE SHEETS.

				OCK

		Okey, dokey.

	INT. TAXI - NIGHT

	Through the WINDOW of the TAXI we see MADISON SQUARE

	GARDEN.

	As it pulls up, a sign reads, "Midnight Madness! MTV's

	Rock and Wrestling 'SLAMMY Awards!" The TAXI come to a

	stop.

				PETER

			(looking up at the sign)

		MTV Wrestling?!

				REISS

			(getting out)

		That's the place. Pay the man.

	MAX REISS gets out, he is carrying a BOX.

				PETER

		Look, Mr. Reiss... I'm not real

		interested in watching a wrestling match.

				REISS

		Who said anything about watching a

		wrestling match? You're here to win a

		wrestling match!

				PETER

		Me? You must be kidding.

	REISS hustles PETER inside.

				REISS

		You hop around. You know, the way you

		did last night. Your opponent gets tired.

		He falls down. The ref counts to three,

		you win, and we pick up a thousand bucks.

	INT. CATACOMBS MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT

	We can hear the CROWD screaming at something in the

	background as REISS leads PETER to an employee WASHROOM

	and shows him the BOX.

				REISS

		You're really gonna love this.

				PETER

		Look, really, I don't know...

				REISS

		You don't have to know. I know enough

		for both of us.

			(pause)

		Change in there.

				PETER

		What is this?

				REISS

		A costume... something that fits your

		talent. Go put it on. I'm sure you'll

		like it.

	He slaps the BOX against PETER'S chest and all but pushes

	him inside.

	INT. WASHROOM - NIGHT

	PETER takes the suit out of the BOX. It is the SPIDER-MAN

	SUIT! He looks at it and shrugs. Then he begins to

	struggle into it.

	PETER is looking at himself in the MIRROR. He is dressed

	in all but the MASK. And he looks terrific! He flexes.

	He smoothes his hair. He's starting to get into it.

	INT. THE ARENA - NIGHT

	CRUSHER COLE is destroying an opponent.

	INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

	REISS winces as the CROWD CHEERS and BOOS.

				PETER

			(comes out)

		How does it look? I feel like it's

		Halloween.

				REISS

		Cover your face with the mask.

				PETER

		Why?

				REISS

		Mystery, my friend. Nobody should know

		who you are...

	INT. THE RING - NIGHT

	CRUSHER COLE is doing a big flexing number and the CROWD

	is going wild. There are MTV CAMERAS and SIGNS and

	BANNERS proclaiming the "SLAMMIES" everywhere.

				RING ANNOUNCER

		And now, a new challenger, for the

		thousand dollar fight, weighing in at one

		hundred and fifty pounds... from parts

		unknown! Here is the Amazing...

		Mysterious... Incredible Superman...

				REISS

			(snorts from ringside,

			hating the name)

		No, not Superman... Spider-Man...

		SPIDER-MAN!!!

				RING ANNOUNCER

		...Spider-Man!!!!!

	The CROWD BOOS the slender newcomer who climbs awkwardly

	through the ropes. Rock music blares. TWIN REDHEADS in

	RED BIKINIS ring a bell.

	CRUSHER COLE and SPIDER-MAN circle. COLE is twice

	SPIDEY'S size. SPIDEY spots a TV CAMERA for the first

	time. He momentarily freezes. CRUSHER sneers the CRUSHER

	sneer. Then he charges!

	With the agility of a spider, SPIDEY leaps out of the way.

	CRUSHER comes back at him. SPIDEY leaps again, bigger!

	The acrobatics get more and more dramatic as CRUSHER COLE

	works himself up into a theatrical rage. Taunts erupt

	from the CROWD.

				OLD LADY

		Kill the sucker, Crusher!

	SPIDEY, really getting into it now, begins playing for the

	CAMERAS.

				HIPSTER

			(between two blondes)

		Whatsamatter, Crusher, can't you crush

		that bug?

				CRUSHER

			(to Spidey)

		Okay, Web Face, this is it!

	He misses SPIDEY again!

				HIPSTER

		Hey, Crusher, you need a insecticide!

			(his blondes titter)

	INT. LIZ/KIM'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

	LIZ'S side is all schoolwork. KIM'S side is all ROCK

	POSTERS and STUFFED ANIMALS. LIZ is curled up doing

	homework. FLASH and KIM sit on the edge of the bed

	watching the "SLAMMIES" on MTV.

				FLASH

		Will you look at this Spider-Man guy! He

		is absolutely incredible!

				KIM

		Liz, get a load of this outfit! I wish I

		had it for the Halloween party... it's

		quite sexy.

				LIZ

		Will you two shush. I'm trying to work.

	INT. RING - NIGHT

	The match continues in an increasingly spectacular

	choreography. CRUSHER bellows at the SCREAMING CROWD.

	But there's a gleam in his eye. This is it!

	He charges. SPIDEY, playing the CAMERAS for all he's

	worth, leaps way, way up. But this time CRUSHER stops

	dead in his tracks. SPIDER-MAN comes back down into a

	forearm SMASH that sends him reeling into a corner.

	CRUSHER does a flying pin. 300 pounds. WOMP! The air

	leaves SPIDEY in a rush as CRUSHER covers him, smothering

	him. The CROWD goes WILD.

				REF

		One...!

				REISS

		Get up...! Get up...!

				REF

		Two...!

	Not realizing his own strength and panicky about being

	squashed, SPIDER-MAN throws CRUSHER COLE off him and up

	into the air. Way up! Reiss cheers... Spider-Man comes

	down and knocks CRUSHER for the first time.

	CRUSHER flies away and out of the arena, eight rows back!

	The HIPSTER sees CRUSHER coming at him and bolts from his

	seat. CRUSHER lands on it, in between the TWO BLONDES who

	break into utter hysterics.

	SPIDEY, surprised at his own strength, watches CRUSHER

	land.

				SPIDER-MAN

			(whispers to himself)

		Wow...

				REF

		Ladies and Gentlemen, history is made

		today, we have here the first man to win

		a thousand dollars against the mighty

		Crusher.

	The REF raises his hand in victory. The CROWD BOOS and

	DEBRIS rains down. But some in the CROWD CHEER wildly,

	recognizing the new sensation.

	SPIDER-MAN steps down from the right as REISS leads the

	CHEERS.

				PETER

		Max! Am I really gonna get a thousand...

				REISS

		We are going to get a thousand--

	PETER turns with REISS and comes face to face with CRUSHER

	COLE. Two ominous beats.

				CRUSHER

		Hi, who are you, kid?

				PETER

		I'm Peter Parker.

				REISS

		He is Spider-Man, and I handle him...

		Whenever you want a rematch call me.

		Next time it's gonna be ten thousand,

		what do you say... Crusher?

				SPIDER-MAN

		Oh, look, Mr. Crusher, I'm really sorry

		about what happened in there. Really...

				CRUSHER

		Oh, well, I don't know what happened to

		me tonight...

			(measures his muscles)

		I really don't know...

				REISS

		I know... you lost. Big man you lost to

		the Amazing Spider-Man.

	EXT. CITY STREET - NEAR A HOSPITAL - DAY

	WE ARE TIGHT ON A NEW YORK JOURNAL TRUCK. On its SIDE

	BANNER is a PICTURE of SPIDER-MAN'S face. Headline: "Who

	is he? Mega-Smash Hits MTV!"

	The TRUCK pulls away and we see PETER, LIZ, HARRY and KIM

	standing on the sidewalk waiting to cross. PETER is

	rocking on his heels and smirking.

				PETER

			(indicating truck)

		You know who that is?

				LIZ

			(walking ahead)

		Yeah... he's some clown we saw on TV last

		night... boy does Flash think he's hot.

				PETER

		He does...

				KIM

		I love wrestling.

				HARRY

		Wrestling is all bluff. Do you really

		believe this little guy in a stupid

		Spider-Man suit beat the Crusher?

				LIZ

		Hey, we better rush... visiting hours

		will be over soon.

	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR & ROOM - DAY

	The NURSE leads PETER and LIZ and HARRY into the room.

				NURSE

		Doctor Octavius? You have visitors.

		Doctor Octavius?

	We hold for a beat. When LIZ takes a step forward to look

	around we expect the worst. But nothing grabs her.

	PETER sees a pile of PLASTER on the floor. He looks up

	and sees the hole in the ceiling. LIZ and HARRY look up

	too. OCK is not there.

				PETER

		Ock is not here!

				LIZ

		My God, what happened?

				NURSE

		I'd better call the doctor!

				HARRY

		You'd better call the police!

	KIM screams.

	INT. CORRIDOR TO OCK'S LAB - DAY

	OCK, hiding his WALDOS under a white hospital robe. He

	stalls until he reaches the door. Then one of his WALDOS

	peaks out and snaps open the new locks on the door.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK, in a white hospital robe walks through the surreal

	debris. Two WALDOS reach out and "sense" the ripples on

	opposite WALLS. He runs a hand through his hair.

				OCK

		What a wreck. What a useless, wasted

		wreck. Okey, dokey. We rebuild you, my

		damaged darling. Bigger, better, hotter!

		A world class, super cyclotron!

	He hears a NOISE behind him and reacts. And here comes

	WEINER. Bedraggled, shuffling through the CONTROL ROOM

	door. He eyeballs the incredible wreckage.

				WEINER

		There you are, doc... where have you

		been... whoa this place is messed up.

	OCK turns, WALDOS writhing. WEINER sees them and kind of

	ducks, remembering how he was hit by them once.

				WEINER

			(smirks)

		Whoa, doc! You look a little messed up

		yourself.

				OCK

		Where have you been, you imbecile?

				WEINER

		I went to the wrestling...

				OCK

		Wrestling...

				WEINER

		I went after the kid. You still want

		that Parker guy's data, don't you?

				OCK

		Well, did you get it?

				WEINER

		No, I followed him... but I lost him in

		the crowd.

				OCK

		Lost him? You--

				WEINER

		I'll find him, Maestro... I promise...

		soon... maybe by tomorrow.

				OCK

		So how was the wrestling?

				WEINER

		Fantastic! There was this new wrestler...

		beat the mighty Crusher. You won't

		believe it... a nothing of a guy... calls

		himself this stupid name... the Amazing

		Spider-Man... would you believe it?

				OCK

		Spider-Man, huh? Well, maybe I'll just

		go and wrestle myself one of these days...

		with all my new arms... I'm sure I can

		beat Crusher or any other monster.

	Suddenly OCK throws out his WALDOS from under his long

	white coat, grabs WEINER and, lifts him up in the air,

	smiles cynically and with cruelty!

				OCK

		Will I beat him, this Crusher, will I

		beat him or not?

				WEINER

		No... no, please... I mean yes, yes...

		you'll beat him easily... let me down...

		Please... I'll do anything for you...

				OCK

		The Parker data... get me the Parker

		data, you hear?!!!

	EXT. PETER PARKER'S ROOFTOP - DAY

	A CAMERA is mounted on a TRIPOD facing us. A TIMER winds

	down and it CLICKS.

	REVERSE ANGLE - CAMERA'S POV.

	SPIDER-MAN is clinging to the side of a WALL.

				SPIDER-MAN

		And one like this...

			(changing pose)

		And one looking real sincere.

	The WHITE EYES narrow to a slit. CLICK.

	Suddenly he spots WEINER climbing onto his roof. He

	hides.

	WEINER tiptoes into the roof apartment. SPIDER-MAN jumps

	in and grabs him.

				SPIDER-MAN

		What are you doing here?

				WEINER

		I'm looking for Peter Parker.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Oh, yes... so why not use the front door?

	SPIDER-MAN throws him back onto the roof so that he almost

	slides over the edge. WEINER turns, facing SPIDER-MAN.

				WEINER

		Hey, I know you...

				SPIDER-MAN

		You do?

				WEINER

		I saw you crushing the Crusher.

				SPIDER-MAN

		You like wrestling?

	SPIDER-MAN jumps and reaches WEINER.

				WEINER

		I love it! You are the best wrestler I

		have ever seen... please don't hurt me!

	SPIDER-MAN picks up WEINER, throws him up to an antenna

	above the building, to which WEINER clings desperately.

	SPIDER-MAN circles the antenna.

				WEINER

		Oh, please... don't kill me. Please help

		me down.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Of course I'll help you down. I am

		Spider-Man... the good guy, am I not?

				WEINER

		Yes... yes, you are.

	SPIDER-MAN jumps to the CHIMNEY, picks WEINER up in his

	arms and whispers to him.

				SPIDER-MAN

		And by the way, Peter Parker does not

		live here anymore...

	SPIDER-MAN jumps with WEINER in his arms to the edge of

	the roof.

				SPIDER-MAN

		And tell the Professor he can't have

		Peter's data. Goodbye.

	SPIDER-MAN drops WEINER off the roof, three floors

	straight down into heavy bushes below.

	INT. ELECTRODYNE FACTORY SHOP - DAY

	A SIGN tells us so. A CLERK is double checking a long

	list of items OCK has ordered.

	CLERK

	Holy cow, whattaya building, fella, a

	cyclotron?

			(Ock glares at him)

		Okay... lets see here. Page three. We

		got 30,000 feet of 50-gauge copper co-ax...

		twin 550 XK transformers... cadmium

		accelerator rails, a half dozen... a GBC

		relative multi-phase transducer... and

		one yellow thermos.

			(finishes computation)

		That'll be $475,989.65...

				OCK

		Wrap it up...

	CLERK

	What about the money... or do you pay by

	credit card?

				OCK

			(a long beat)

		Cash! I'll be back soon.

	EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE OF A BANK - BACK DOOR - NIGHT

	An ARMORED TRUCK rolls by and stops. TWO GUARDS open the

	Bank's DOORS.

	Suddenly a WALDO smashes through the DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW

	of the ARMORED TRUCK, wrapping around the DRIVER'S NECK

	and pulling him through the WINDOW. The SHOTGUN goes for

	his weapon, but a WALDO smashes in and pulls the GUN out

	through his WINDOW.

	TWO WALDOS shoot out and attach themselves to the REAR

	DOOR.

				BANK GUARD

		What's going on here?

	The WALDO knocks him over. OCK rips the DOOR off! The

	TRUCK is full of MONEY BAGS.

				OCK

		Cash!

	INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY

	A PHOTO ASSISTANT look on as JAMESON goes over PETER'S

	latest PHOTOS. They are his SPIDER-MAN shots.

				PETER

		Doesn't he look amazing in that one?

		Look, he's flying in the air!

				JAMESON

		I don't care if he flies to the moon.

		He's just another wrestler in a silly

		costume. Look at this, Parker, right off

		the wire. This is the guy who hit that

		armored truck this morning. They say he

		has metal arms... get me a picture of

		this character!

				PETER

		Metal arms?

				JAMESON

		Four of them.

				PETER

		Ock...?!

				JAMESON

		The web faced weirdo... He is a joke in a

		Halloween costume... don't make me laugh.

	He tears up PETER'S SPIDEY PHOTOS.

				JAMESON

		Now get out of here and don't come back

		without something I can use!

				PETER

		Yes sir...

			(stops, and turns back)

				JAMESON

		A mega baloney... A bug in blue tights...

		what next?

				PETER

		The Journal said he was a mega-smash on

		MTV...

	INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT

	WEINER is putting on a CLOWN SUIT. He fastidiously puts

	his ratty jacket on a hanger and hangs it on a PIPE. The

	PIPE turns into a snake. It is, in fact, a WALDO!

				OCK

			(turning from work)

		What do you think you're doing?

				WEINER

		I'm going to the Masquerade. It's

		Halloween tonight Doc, aren't you coming

		to the School Ball? Whoa, you could go

		without an outfit.

	A WALDO whips around WEINER'S throat... AARRRGH!

				OCK

		You're not going to any ball, clown.

		You're going to get me Peter Parker's

		data...

				WEINER

		I was almost killed on my last try...

		Look at all these bruises...

				OCK

		I don't care if you come back dead. Just

		get it!

				WEINER

			(croaking)

		Cost you a thousand bucks, if I get it.

	The WALDO coils tighten around WEINER'S throat.

				WEINER

		All right... boss please let go...

		P L E A S E ...

				OCK

		Just get it, Weiner. I'm running out of

		time. If you fail me again, you won't

		have to concern yourself with money

		anymore... DO YOU GET ME CLOWN?!

	WEINER croaks his assent.

	INT. CAFETERIA - NIGHT

	It is all dressed up for a party: LIGHTS, STREAMERS,

	GLITTER BALL, the WORKS! HARRY is dressed as a SPACEMAN;

	PETER wears his regular clothes.

				HARRY

		You should have worn a costume. I told

		you to wear a costume.

				PETER

		It's... embarrassing.

				HARRY

		There's Liz...

	LIZ is crossing the dance floor dressed as an INDIAN

	PRINCESS in an MINI-DRESS.

				PETER

		Yeah...

	ROZ, dressed as a COWBOY, ambles over.

				ROZ

		... howdy partners.

				PETER/HARRY

		Hiya, Professor Rosomorf.

				HARRY

		Any word on Doctor Octavius?

				ROZ

			(falling in step)

		Nothing beyond what I read in the papers.

		I'm afraid he's not the same man we knew.

		You know, I've been digging through the

		notes on his experiments...

	PETER follows LIZ with his eyes. She takes a seat at a

	TABLE next to KIM who wears a HAREM GIRL outfit with the

	SALAMANDER around her neck. Next to KIM is... SPIDER-MAN!

	PETER'S eyes go wide.

				ROZ

		You boys must have had an extraordinary

		classroom experience.

				PETER

			(eyeing Spidey)

		Yes sir... oh... I'm going to be a little

		late with my paper on the Planetary

		Conjunction, sir...

				ROZ

		Whenever you're ready... I'll look at it.

		I know it's going to be an important

		work... and Peter, take my hat.

	He hands PETER an oversized TEN GALLON HAT.

				ROZ

		It is a costume party.

	PETER and HARRY make their way through the dance floor to

	the table. PETER can't take his eyes off SPIDEY.

				HARRY

		Look, there's Spider-Man!

				PETER

		Not the real one, I'm sure...

				HARRY

		You can never be sure... all kinds of

		crazy stuff can happen at a masquerade

		ball...

				PETER

		I bet I know who it is.

	As they take seats, PETER sees that SPIDER-MAN is trying

	to read the BUGLE'S sports section by party light. KIM

	waves. PETER nods and the BIG HAT falls over his face.

				PETER

		Hiya, Liz...

	LIZ moves to Flash, who's dressed in the SPIDER-MAN

	costume.

				LIZ

		Hiya, Peter. Who is in the Spider-Man

		costume?

				PETER

		It's a very clever outfit you've got

		there, Flash.

				FLASH

		Take a hike, asshole.

				LIZ

			(to Peter)

		How did you recognize him?

				PETER

		His pretty blue eyes give him away...

				HARRY

		Anyway, who'll be sitting with you at the

		Halloween Ball?

				LIZ

			(whispers to Flash)

		I wanna dance... Hey, Spider-Man... Shall

		we Flash dance?

				FLASH/SPIDER-MAN

		Hey, I'm reading the paper, okay?

	LIZ turns with a mild pout. Nervously, PETER ponders his

	chance. HARRY nudges him.

				HARRY

		Take her now, it's easy...

	HARRY turns to KIM and does a clanking shimmy in the SPACE

	SUIT.

				HARRY

		Wanna dance, Schechrezaa?

				KIM

		I'm pooped.

				LIZ

		I'm not...

	She reaches for HARRY'S hand.

				FLASH

		Holy jumping jelly beans, willya look at

		these pictures of Spider-Man? Wow! Is

		this guy great or what?

	LIZ looks. She shrugs. Then she shrieks.

				LIZ

		Hey, Peter! These are your pictures!

				FLASH

		Can't be...

				LIZ

		It says here "Photos by Peter Parker."

	PETER reacts, then looks over FLASH'S other shoulder.

	INSERT: There are three PHOTOS of SPIDER-MAN in the paper.

	PETER BLUSHES, smiling.

				FLASH

			(takes off his head mask)

		You know this guy, Parker?

				PETER

		Well, yeah... sort of...

				FLASH

		Wow... I'll give you anything if you

		introduce us.

				HARRY

			(to Liz)

		Will you grant me this dance...?

	LIZ joins him provocatively.

				KIM

		Hey, Flash-Man... Wanna dance...?

				FLASH

		Well, why not.

	PETER is left alone, PETER leaves toward the entrance.

	At the REAR DOOR a BIG LIZARD passes a NOTE to a DALLAS

	COWGIRL who passes it to a KANGAROO. The KANGAROO hops

	across the dance floor to the STAGE where he hands the

	NOTE to a YOUNG WOMAN in a BASEBALL UNIFORM.

	She climbs the STAGE where she is bathed in a SPOTLIGHT.

	She gets a DRUM ROLL from the band. There are some BOOS

	as the bad stops.

				YOUNG WOMAN

		Thank you, thank you. We have a special

		surprise guest tonight.

			(booo)

		The Empire State University Masquerade

		Ball presents... The "Slammy" winning

		star of MTV'S wrestling tournament... The

		Amazing Spider-Man!

	FLASH, amazed turns to LIZ. He points to himself and

	mouths, "Me?" (The REAL) SPIDEY drops from the ceiling and

	lands in a pose. The CROWD cheers. He does a flip to LIZ

	and extends a hand. The BAND starts up. LIZ demurs.

				FLASH

			(whispers firmly)

		Go ahead... go ahead!

	LIZ takes SPIDEY'S hand and they move slowly and sexily

	onto the dance floor. They do a short simple number.

	SPIDEY returns LIZ to FLASH.

				LIZ

			(to Flash)

		Come on... Flash...

	FLASH takes LIZ from PETER (SPIDER-MAN).

	LIZ and FLASH dance wildly. They finish to big cheers.

	The real SPIDER-MAN slides to center floor. The crowd

	backs away as SPIDEY spins out the greatest dance number

	in film history. He's all over the floor and on the walls

	and on the ceiling and on the GLITTER BALL. He takes LIZ

	and flies with her. He breaks the place up. Then drops

	in a pose. BIG CHEERS.

	LIZ stops breathless, very near to SPIDER-MAN'S face.

				LIZ

			(whispers breathless)

		Who are you...?

				PETER

		One day you'll know...

				LIZ

			(a long beat)

		You sound very familiar.

				PETER/SPIDER-MAN

		Sure I do... I'm your friendly

		neighborhood Spider-Man!

	He jumps away and disappears, leaving the CROWD aghast and

	LIZ in love.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

	BEN is flicking through the channels of his TV, aggravated

	as usual. It's all ROCK VIDEOS!

				BEN

			(to May)

		What a bunch of crap. Goddamn rock and

		roll's screwed up the whole TV.

	He flicks off the set and turns to MAY who's asleep on the

	couch. He gently nudges her.

				BEN

		Come on, May. Wake up and go to sleep.

	EXT. TAXI - NIGHT

	It enters the EAST RIVER DRIVE.

	INT. TAXI - NIGHT

	As the city rolls by.

				SPIDER-MAN

			(fearful)

		Hey! Can't you go any faster?

				CABBIE

		What'm I in, a race?

				SPIDER-MAN

			(fighting his fear)

		I don't know... I get this tingling in my

		brain, like some danger is lurking just

		ahead. I'm worried about Aunt May and

		Uncle Ben...

				CABBIE

		Your family?

				SPIDER-MAN

		Well, they are kind of my parents. They

		raised me. I lost both of my parents in

		a car accident... please step on it!

				CABBIE

		Step on it... so now you want to kill

		yourself in another accident... not with

		me, Boychick.

				SPIDER-MAN

		But I'm telling you... I've got this--

				CABBIE

		... tingling... I know. And I got

		ulcers... Everybody's got something to

		worry about.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Please... Faster... Please.

				CABBIE

		Okay, you asked for it.

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	The TAXI skids and swerves like crazy, bumping into

	everything in sight.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	A GLASS SHATTERS. AUNT MAY sits up in bed with a start.

				AUNT MAY

		What's that?

				BEN

		What? It's nothing... go back to sleep...

			(another crash)

		Oh, I'll go look. Go back to sleep.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

	WEINER is going through the drawers. He finds a nice BONE

	HANDLE KNIFE and pockets it.

				WEINER

		Hmmm...

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	BEN descends the stairs from the bedroom. He peers off

	into the darkness and pulls his ROBE tight around him as

	if to ward off some unacknowledged danger.

	EXT. TAXI - NIGHT

	TAXI driving fast through STREET.

	INT. TAXI - NIGHT

				CABBIE

		Some crazy kinda town, huh? You hear

		about that hold-up? The guy with the six

		arms? Hey, I see it all on this job.

			(a beat)

		What kinda outfit is that, anyway?

				SPIDER-MAN

			(panicked)

		Look, I'm really in a hurry.

	BANG! A BLOW OUT. The CABBIE fights the wheel to the

	side of the road. Then he turns to SPIDEY.

				CABBIE

			(sly)

		You said the magic words, we have a flat

		Boychick.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

	BEN comes in and looks around. A long beat. Then a

	noise.

				BEN

		Mice...

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	A very scared WEINER hides, eyes widening. WEINER takes

	the BONE HANDLE KNIFE from his pocket. It glints in the

	MOONLIGHT. He moves off.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

	BEN is looking for mice. He opens a closet. Nothing. He

	shifts around. Nothing. He moves off.

	EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT

	The CABBIE slowly changes the TIRE. Fearing the worst,

	SPIDEY gets out, looking for a ride. A TRUCK approaches.

	SPIDEY looks down at the CABBIE and then up at the TRUCK.

				CABBIE

		Hey! You wanna hand me that lug wrench?

	He looks up to see SPIDEY go by, stuck to the side of the

	TRUCK like a spider.

				CABBIE

		Some crazy kinda town...

	EXT. THE TRUCK - NIGHT

	SPIDEY stares at the lettering on the side of the TRUCK.

	It says, "Victory Sporting Goods."

				SPIDER-MAN

			(a thought)

		Sporting goods...

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	BEN comes in quietly. He looks around. He opens a

	closet. Nothing. He hears a CRASH. He wheels. A

	SHADOWY FIGURE runs by a doorway!

	BEN takes off like a shot!

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	BEN runs through the rooms.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

	BEN flies in and goes right to the RIFLE on the wall. WE

	hear WEINER clattering around the house in the background

	as BEN goes to a drawer and pulls out a BOX of BULLETS.

	He begins to fight the BULLETS into the RIFLE.

	WEINER comes flying in and tackles him. They fall to the

	floor, four hands on the RIFLE. They scuffle.

				WEINER

		All I want it the kid's computer crap!

				BEN

		Let go before I blow your brain's out.

	EXT. FOREST HILLS STREET - NIGHT

	The TRUCK pulls away leaving PETER in a POOL of STREET

	LAMP LIGHT. He's wearing a FOOTBALL JERSEY and SHORTS and

	carrying a SPORTS BAG. He begins to run.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	MAY hears a CRASH. She pulls the covers up around her

	chin in fear.

				BEN (V.O.)

		Let go!

				WEINER (V.O.)

		You let go!

	EXT. BEN AND MAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	PETER runs up and hears a SHOT. He runs inside.

	INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

	PETER runs in. He sees WEINER standing there with the

	RIFLE. They face off across the room. The moment hits

	PETER like a punch in the chest.

				PETER

		Uncle Ben!

				BEN

			(a wheeze)

		Peter...

	PETER rushes to BEN.

				PETER

		Oh my God... Uncle Ben...

	PETER tries to revive BEN, while WEINER runs out.

	INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

	PLASTIC FURNITURE, GARISH LIGHTING, CIGARETTES in the

	ASHTRAYS.

				AUNT MAY

			(a brave but fragile front)

		Ben gets through everything. He'll be

		alright. The doctors are...

	AUNT MAY and PETER embrace, leaning on each other for

	support.

				DETECTIVE

			(compassionate)

		Excuse me. You the nephew?

	PETER rises, nods. As AUNT MAY wipes away a sniffle...

				DETECTIVE

		Your uncle's a brave man. Apparently,

		the perpetrator was after something of

		yours. Your uncle didn't know what it

		was but he stood up to him anyway. You

		ought to be proud of him.

				PETER

		I am... how is he...

	A grim-faced DOCTOR walks slowly across the room to

	them... MAY stands up slowly.

				DETECTIVE

		Ask the Doctor.

				AUNT MAY

		How's my... how's my husband doing...?

				DOCTOR

		Mrs. Parker, I'm sorry. We tried.

	MAY collapses.

				DOCTOR

		Crash cart! STAT!

	The Detective pulls PETER gently away. The STAFF works on

	MAY.

				DETECTIVE

		Let the medics handle it.

			(pause)

		Look, if it makes you feel any better.

		We're gonna nail this guy. He crashed

		his getaway car. We got him trapped in a

		warehouse on Jackson.

				NURSE

			(to Peter)

		She's alright. She just fainted. We'll

		have to check her for symptoms of shock.

		If you want to wait, you can get some

		coffee on the third floor.

				PETER

		No, I... I think I wanna go out for some

		fresh air.

	EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	COP CARS, COPS, SEARCHLIGHTS playing their BEAMS against

	the ACME CHEMICAL STORAGE BUILDING. GUNFIRE flashes from

	one of the WINDOWS.

	EXT. COP CAR - NIGHT

	ELITE COPS in BASEBALL CAPS are plotting strategy.

				COP #1

		That place is loaded with solvents and

		chemicals. If we blast our way in, it's

		gonna go up like a roman candle.

				COP #2

		We could go in through the fifth floor

		wash room.

				COP #1

		What's that up there? Throw a light on

		that!

	COP #1 directs the BEAM of the SEARCHLIGHT.

	EXT. WAREHOUSE WALL - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN is climbing it, trapped in the GLARE of the

	SEARCHLIGHT. He freezes.

				COP #1

		He's got a partner!

	EXT. COP CAR - NIGHT

	Every COP'S WEAPON is trained upward at SPIDER-MAN!

				COP #2

			(on radio)

		We got an accomplice up there! And we

		got a clear shot. Do we have a go?

				RADIO

			(filtered)

		That's a go.

	EXT. WAREHOUSE WALL - NIGHT

	GUNSHOTS erupt around SPIDER-MAN and he skitters around to

	evade them.

	INT. THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	Thinking they're shooting at him, WEINER shoots back. In

	the corner of his eye he sees SPIDER-MAN at a side WINDOW.

	He aims his rifle and SPIDEY ducks out of the way.

	The frightened WEINER moves to the side WINDOW to blow

	SPIDEY away. As he moves past the front WINDOWS he is lit

	by the SEARCHLIGHTS that play on his face darkly.

	SPIDEY leaps in at FRONT WINDOW and drops neatly behind

	WEINER, landing a pose.

				SPIDER-MAN

			(cold, hard)

		Say your prayers, Weiner!

	WEINER whips around and fires. SPIDEY leaps to avoid it

	and lands on a STACK of PAINT CANS.

				WEINER

		You ain't takin' me... Spider-Man... who

		ever you are...

	SPIDEY gathers himself tighter. He leaps. A second GUN

	BURST comes in behind him, Several PAINT CANS erupt in

	cascades of COLOR.

				SPIDER-MAN

			(hanging on ceiling)

		Hey, creep!

	WEINER aims and fires, several times. He is emptying his

	RIFLE. SPIDEY leaps away and lands on the top of a CASK

	marked "CAUTION-FLAMMABLE SOLVENT!"

				SPIDER-MAN

			(taunting)

		Try again.

	The CASK gives way and SPIDEY is plunged into the

	FLAMMABLE SOLVENT. WEINER smiles his stupid grin and

	takes aim.

	SPIDEY leaps out of the CASK and sticks to the roof BEAM.

	He's sopping wet. His hand slips down the BEAM as the

	SOLVENT works against his sticking power.

	He falls to the floor and scrambles behind some PAINT

	CANS. WEINER, crazed, fires wildly. One of the CANS

	EXPLODES. PAINT flows from it... burning!

	SPIDEY peeks out and sees a YELLOW RIVER OF FLAME creeping

	toward him. He sniffs his SOLVENT soaked outfit.

	He backs down a "corridor" of PAINT CANS. The YELLOW FIRE

	follows, now joined by a RIVER OF BLUE FIRE from another

	can. They're following the trail of SOLVENT he's

	dripping!

	He's trapped!

				COP (V.O.)

			(on bullhorn)

		This is your last chance, you two.

		Either you're coming out, or we're coming

		in!

	SPIDEY'S against the WALL! PAINT CANS to his right and

	left, and a RIVER of RED FLAME joins the YELLOW and BLUE

	as they creep toward him!

	He climbs backwards up the wall, face toward the BLAZE.

	The COLORED FIRES join and follow him up the wall!

	They're licking at his feet!

				WEINER

			(at the window)

		Stay back!

			(gun burst)

		Whoa... stay back down there!

	SPIDEY is inches from being torched. He sees a PIPE. He

	reaches out and grabs it. He swings out above the flames.

	But the PIPE begins to bend!

	The PIPE bends down... down... and then breaks! SPIDEY

	hangs precariously as WATER cascades out of the PIPE and

	puts out the FIRE.

	SPIDEY drops down and rest his head in his hands to

	collect himself. Then looks up. The GUN is at his head.

				WEINER

		Stand up, you.

	SPIDEY stands.

				COP (V.O.)

		You have thirty seconds to come out!

				WEINER

		You're my ticket outa here. Gimme that

		stupid mask!

	SPIDER-MAN hesitates. Then he begins to raise the MASK,

	but stops and shakes his head no.

				WEINER

		Then I'll take it myself.

	He reaches for the mask and SPIDER-MAN flips him across

	the room. WEINER lands in a CARGO net and becomes

	ensnared.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Well, look what we've caught in our web...

				WEINER

		Don't hurt me, man. Please don't hurt me...

	INT. WAREHOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	COPS are poised at the door. A signal. They crash

	inside.

	INT. WAREHOUSE PAINT ROOM - NIGHT

				COP #1

		Hold your fire!

	WEINER is hanging from the ceiling in the the CARGO NET.

				WEINER

		Get me out of this madhouse!

	He falls down, immediately encircled by the POLICE

	OFFICERS. SPIDER-MAN flies above their heads, crashing

	through the WINDOW and disappears into the dark of night.

	INT. CYCLOTRON - NIGHT

	A weird, flickering BLUE LIGHT dances around the hole in

	the CYCLOTRON. Then it cuts out. A HELMETED MAN pulls

	himself out of a HATCH. He flips up the HELMET.

	OCK is finishing putting together his new equipment.

				OCK

			(smiling)

		Okey, dokey.

	OCK goes about checking out the CYCLOTRON. It looks good.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK starts flicking switches and reading DIALS, doing a

	"mission countdown" for his next experiment. This place

	has been "hot rodded" to the max.

				OCK

			(reading dials and numbers)

		Amperage, okay. Flux, 14. Negative

		variable differential... good enough.

	He shuts it down. The WHINE whirs down.

				OCK

		Okey, dokey... now all I need is Parker's

		data. Where the hell is Weiner? Damn it...

		I can't trust anybody.

			(throws his Waldo in the air)

		Only you, my babies... only you can I

		trust... Okay... If I have to do

		everything myself... I'm going to do it.

			(to his equipment)

		I'll be back... my babies... my new

		babies!

	OCK hides the WALDOS under his coat and leaves the room.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	There is more EQUIPMENT than before. PETER is deep at

	work. His SPIDER-MAN UNIFORM hangs on the WALL. There is

	a knock at the DOOR.

				LIZ (V.O.)

		Hey, Peter! Are you finished with my

		computer yet? I got a paper too, you

		know...

				PETER

			(panicked)

		Oh my God... oh, it's you, Liz... I

		didn't expect you... uh... give me a

		minute.

	He hides his SPIDER-MAN COSTUME.

	INT. THE HALLWAY LANDING - NIGHT

	LIZ waits impatiently.

				PETER

			(opening the door)

		Hi, Liz. Come on in.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	LIZ enters, looking around. PETER covers for this and

	that.

				LIZ

		What were you doing in here?

				PETER

			(looking around)

		Cleaning up. Come on. I'll get your

		computer. Where's Flash parked?

	He picks up the COMPUTER and turns to her, but she's

	already looking around the apartment.

				LIZ

		Flash didn't come.

				PETER

			(holding it)

		Oh. Well... how are you going to get it

		home?

	LIZ walks into the room.

				LIZ

		Taxi... I guess.

	She discovers the PRINTS of SPIDEY that PETER has taped up

	around the apartment.

				LIZ

		You must spend a lot of time with this

		Spider-Man guy... Peter! Don't you think

		you ought to unplug that!

	PETER looks and sees that he is tethered to the wall.

	Embarrassed, he puts the COMPUTER back down.

				PETER

			(embarrassed)

		I, uh, I'll go down to the corner... see

		it I can hail that taxi.

	PETER leaves. LIZ smiles. She likes PETER. Why is he

	so...?

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	A SHADOW of a MAN can be seen hiding. PETER does not

	notice him.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	There's a KNOCK at the DOOR.

				LIZ

			(crossing to it, wondering)

		Peter...?

	She is about to open the door when FOUR WALDOS smash

	through it, obliterating it. OCK stands in the shattered

	doorway, WALDOS writhing.

				LIZ

		Doctor Octavius...! You're... You're...

			(finds the words)

		You're so weird!... with those... what do

		you call those...

				OCK

		Waldos... Did you hear about Spider-Man?

			(moving Waldos like spider's legs)

		That's me... the real Spider-Man... now

		tell me, where is that jerky friend of

		yours... Parker?

				LIZ

			(protecting)

		Peter?... oh... he's not here. He's gone.

		I don't think he'll be back for awhile.

				OCK

			(running his Waldo in her hair)

		You wouldn't lie to your Professor now,

		would you?

				LIZ

		Of course not. Why would I lie about a

		thing like that? Really. He's... out.

				OCK

		We'll wait.

		OCK grabs LIZ'S HAIR with his WALDOS.

				LIZ

		What are you doing... let me go! Please...

		take those things out of my hair!

				OCK

		My Waldos, you mean.

				LIZ

		Whatever you call them... please...

	OCK shoots out TWO WALDOS. Simultaneously each grabs a

	CHAIR from different parts of the room and brings them to

	the TABLE.

				OCK

		Sit.

	She does. He does, too, and folds his WALDOS across his

	chest.

				OCK

			(chatty)

		He's a nice boy. A little nerdy maybe,

		but nice, wouldn't you say?

				LIZ

		Oh, I don't know. Maybe. He's very

		inexperienced.

	ONE of OCK'S WALDOS rests on the TABLE curled around the

	COMPUTER. LIZ lets her hand rest on it. OCK warms

	immediately.

				OCK

		You know, you're a fascinating young lady...

				LIZ

		Thank you...

				OCK

		You're so refreshing. You're so...

				LIZ

		Shocking...?

				OCK

			(gone to far)

		Oh, I wouldn't say shocking...

				LIZ

		I would!

	She sticks his WALDO in the ELECTRIC WALL SOCKET behind

	the COMPUTER! The CURRENT sizzles through him and he

	leaps up, WALDOS akimbo, like the "cartoon cat." LIZ runs

	out the door.

	OCK extricates himself from the current and gives chase.

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	LIZ burst from the DOOR.

				LIZ

		Peter...!

	She looks both ways for PETER, doesn't see him, and takes

	off! OCK bursts from the doorway and runs off after LIZ.

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	LIZ running as fast as she can, but OCK is gaining

	quickly.

	EXT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A TAXI drives up and disgorges PETER.

				PETER

		Wait here...

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	He walks in. It's empty

				PETER

		Liz?

				LIZ (V.O.)

			(screaming from the street)

		Peter! Help! Peter!

	PETER springs into action. He grabs his SPIDEY SUIT out

	of a drawer and starts taking off his clothes.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	LIZ looks back and sees OCK CARTWHEELING toward her. She

	can't outrun him. She must hide. There's a CONSTRUCTION

	SITE on the right. She ducks down the alley next to it.

	INT. CONSTRUCTION ALLEY - NIGHT

	LIZ runs into it and finds herself trapped on three sides

	by a high CYCLONE FENCE. Behind her, OCK'S WALDOS stretch

	out like waterbug legs. He bug-walks into the alley and

	laughs down at her from his perch atop the WALDOS.

				OCK

		Peter Parker has something I want... And

		I'm going to have something he wants.

	She dashes past him and runs into the outboard CARGO

	ELEVATOR.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	She looks for the UP BUTTON and finds nothing! OCK, on

	his feet now, is on the wire mesh ELEVATOR CAGE in a

	flash. He tears the outer DOOR away.

	LIZ starts pressing KNOBS and LEVERS in panic. The LIGHT

	goes on. A WARNING BELL clangs. She finally finds the

	switch and the CAR leaps up just as OCK tears off its

	front door.

	LIZ, safe for the moment, watches OCK recede below,

	shaking the torn off door in a rage.

	EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

	Extending WALDO over WALDO, OCK climbs the ELEVATOR

	HOUSING chasing the rising CAR inside.

	EXT. CONSTRUCTION ROOF - NIGHT

	The CAR arrives and LIZ jumps out. She's on nothing but a

	narrow GIRDER! She tightropes on the GIRDER. OCK gets to

	the top. He looks across at her. She's stuck between two

	unfastened GIRDERS, at a dead end. He slowly telescopes a

	WALDO toward her. She's got no place to run, no place to

	hide. He grabs her by the BLOUSE and lifts her off the

	GIRDER.

				SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)

		Put her down, Ock.

	OCK looks across the street. There, on the top of a tall

	building, is SPIDER-MAN.

				SPIDER-MAN

		I know what's happening to you, Ock.

		I've been through a lot of changes myself

		lately. You have to listen to me.

				OCK

			(holding Liz)

		Who the hell are you?

				SPIDER-MAN

		Spider-Man.

				LIZ

			(seeing Spidey)

		Spider-Man...

				OCK

		That's a lot of crap, clown... I am

		Spider-Man, not you.

			(points to Liz)

		Ask you girlfriend.

			(to Liz)

		Tell him!

				SPIDER-MAN

		I'm a good friend of Peter Parker's Ock.

		Just like that girl you're holding. Now

		let her go.

	OCK thinks for a moment, then he begins to extend the

	kicking and screaming LIZ out over the street, ten stories

	up.

				OCK

		Let her go? What an excellent idea. If

		you do not deliver your friend, Mr.

		Spider-Man, yes. Yes, of course, I'll

		let her go.

				LIZ

		Put me down, you mechanical mutant!

	LIZ is having none of this. She kicks, she fights. She

	twists. She flails around, making things a little worse.

	The ground is yawning death beneath her. RRIIPP!

	PART of her BLOUSE tears away and LIZ plummets!

	SPIDER-MAN swoops down on a WEB-STRAND in his

	characteristic compound curve. He reaches out for the

	falling LIZ and misses her cleanly. The WEB is too short.

				LIZ

			(falling away)

		You jerk!

	He THWIPS her with a second WEB and together they swing to

	a HIGH GIRDER where he deposits her safe and sound.

				LIZ

			(straightening herself)

		Tell your friend Peter next time I'll get

		the taxi myself...

				OCK

			(screams)

		Hey... you jerk... you phony Spider-Man...

		Prepare to meet your death, bug.

	SPIDEY THWIPS a beam and swings across toward OCK.

				SPIDER-MAN

			(whispers)

		Actually, I'm rather fond of living...

		especially now...

			(he looks at Liz)

	He lands on OCK'S GIRDER and the two progeny of the

	cyclotron face off for the first time, ten stories above

	the street.

				SPIDER-MAN

			(a last appeal to reason)

		Octavius. Just stop and think.

				OCK

		I am thinking, insect. I'm thinking

		about exterminating you!

				SPIDER-MAN

		Okay, if that's the way you want it...

		Let's see what those chrome knuckles can

		do, Doc...

	A WALDO lances out and catches SPIDEY flush on the jaw.

	It knocks him to another GIRDER. SPIDEY hangs on and

	rolls over. He rubs his jaw.

				LIZ

		Great...

	SPIDEY gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by

	another barrage of blows from above.

				OCK

		Now I must kill you, you cretinous clown.

	OCK throws a roundhouse WALDO that nearly knocks SPIDEY

	off the GIRDER. He's just barely hanging on.

	But SPIDER-MAN'S not done yet. He THWIPS a HIGH BEAM and

	swings into a better attack position. The two SUPER-

	ADVERSARIES engage in battle.

	With OCK swinging from his WALDOS like a metal monkey and

	SPIDEY swinging from his WEBS like, well, like SPIDEY,

	they clang and bang through the GIRDERS of the

	CONSTRUCTION SITE.

				OCK

		Once I dispose of you, Spider-Man, no one

		will be able to stop me.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Stop you from what...?

				OCK

		My destiny!

	OCK throws his biggest punch yet.

	SIRENS can now be heard in the street.

	SPIDEY avoids WALDO strike after WALDO strike. OCK eludes

	WEB after WEB. But SPIDEY'S agility soon has him turning

	circles.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Over here, Octopus!

				OCK

		That's Professor Octopus to you Spider

		Jerk!

				SPIDER-MAN

		Give it up, Professor. You'll never

		catch me!

	OCK takes three steps and soars through the air.

	EXT. BRICK WALL - NIGHT

	OCK, misjudging the leap, soars right past SPIDEY and into

	an alley! Screaming all the way...

	EXT. THE ALLEY - NIGHT

	OCK and TWO WALDOS pressed against each of the opposing

	walls. It's a tenuous grip. Then, very slowly, sparks

	flying from his WALDOS, OCK slides down into the alley.

				SPIDER-MAN

		So long, sucker.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	COP CARS pull up. COPS leap from them.

	EXT. SIDE WALL - NIGHT

	OCK makes it down, sees the COPS, ducks out of sight.

	EXT. COP CARS - NIGHT

	The SEARCHLIGHTS go on. SPIDER-MAN swings back across the

	street to the CONSTRUCTION SITE.

				COP #1

		There he is!

				COP #2

		It's that Spider-Man!

	EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

	SPIDEY lands next to LIZ in a pose. Lit by the flashing

	BILLBOARD, he's weirder looking than ever. SPIDEY puts an

	arm around LIZ and extends a WEB SHOOTER.

				LIZ

		What do you think you're doing?

				SPIDER-MAN

		I'm rescuing you.

	With that SPIDEY leaps way out and he and LIZ swoop away

	on a WEB-STRAND.

				LIZ

		Thanks but nooooooooooo!

	EXT. THE COP CARS - NIGHT

	ALL WEAPONS point upward at SPIDEY'S movement.

				COP #2

		He won't get away this time!

				COP #1

		Hold your fire! He's got a girl.

				COP #2

		Looks like he's got a hostage.

	EXT. WEB STRAND - NIGHT

	SPIDEY sees the WEAPONS aimed upward. He shoots out

	another WEB and swings off in a different direction. LIZ

	whoops with the G-force.

				LIZ

		Wait a minute. Where are you taking me?

		SPIDEY hounded by the Police, rejected by the girl.

				SPIDER-MAN

		I better just take you back where you

		belong.

	He shoots out another WEB.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Hold on tight.

				LIZ

			(Times Square)

		Where are we?

				SPIDER-MAN

		Open your eyes.

	They are standing on the ROOF of the CENTRAL TOWER of the

	EMPIRE UNIVERSITY BUILDING. LIZ opens her eyes. It's an

	extraordinary sight.

				LIZ

			(the Empire State Building)

		If you're trying to impress me Spidey, I

		want you to know I'm not easy. Okay, I'm

		impressed... now put me down, Spidey...

		put me down.

				SPIDER-MAN

		I like the way you say Spidey... Nobody

		calls me Spidey... now we go...

	EXT. DORMITORY - NIGHT

	They swoop down... and down... stopping on one of the

	building's SILLS, actually right in front of a WINDOW in

	the DORMITORY BUILDING.

				LIZ

			(Tavern on the Green)

		Wow... look, this is our dormitory. I

		can get to my room. Hey, wait a minute...

		there's Flash, if I'm not mistaken.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Liz?

				LIZ

		You know my name?

				SPIDER-MAN

		Liz, listen to me. There's something I

		have to tell you.

				LIZ

		Okay, put me down and we can talk,

		alright?

				SPIDER-MAN

		Do you know who I am?

				LIZ

		All I know is you're the Amazing

		Spider-Man... or better you're Spidey the

		good guy on the block... you're a weirdo

		in a clown spider suit.

				SPIDER-MAN

		And that's all you know about me?

			(a beat, a sigh)

		Okay, lets get your boyfriend.

				LIZ

		Which one?

				SPIDER-MAN

		How many do you have? I meant Flash.

				LIZ

		Well, Flash is not exactly my boyfriend...

				SPIDER-MAN

		He's not? Then who is?

				LIZ

		There's someone I like, but he's too shy

		to notice.

			(Flash appears)

				SPIDER-MAN

		Flash!

				FLASH

		Liz!

			(a beat)

		SPIDER-MAN!!!

				LIZ

			(to Spider-Man)

		You know everybody... Flash we have to

		call Peter!

	FLASH rushes right past LIZ to the WINDOW. There's a

	NEWSPAPER in his hand.

				FLASH

		Hey, they won't let up, man!

			(shows Daily Bugle)

		They keep calling you an accomplice in

		that burglary murder. But that's a crock,

		ain't it? I'm with you, Spidey, 100%

				SPIDER-MAN

		Thanks.

				FLASH

			(realizing)

		By the way, what are you doing with...

		Liz?

				SPIDER-MAN

		She needed a lift.

				FLASH

		Oh... okay! This calls for a beer! A

		lot of beer!

				SPIDER-MAN

		Thanks, but I have some business to take

		care of.

				FLASH

		Well... take care of that later. Wait

		here. I'll get the beer.

	He disappears. LIZ comes, tentatively, to the WINDOW

	where SPIDEY squats, desire and passion in his WHITE EYES.

				LIZ

			(accusatory)

		How'd you know this was Flash's place?

				SPIDER-MAN

		Peter Parker told me all about it.

				LIZ

		Peter told you all about Flash?

				SPIDER-MAN

		No... he told me all about you. See you

		later.

			(he jumps away)

	INT. DORM - NIGHT

	FLASH comes in with more BEER than a man ought to carry.

				FLASH

		Hey, where'd he go? Hey, Spider-Man!!

	But SPIDER-MAN has disappeared.

				LIZ

			(distracted)

		Peter told your Hero all about me...

				FLASH

		He would, wouldn't he... that jerk!

	EXT. PETER PARKER'S ROOF - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN lands on it. He drops in the SKYLIGHT.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	He drops into the room and pulls off his MASK. The place

	has been ransacked. COMPUTER DISCS are all over the

	floor. PETER pulls a file marked "Planetary Conjunction."

	He opens it.

	A piece of PAPER falls out. It says, "Kiss it goodbye,

	Wall Crawler!"

				PETER

			(whispers angrily)

		Octavius!!!

	EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY QUAD - DAY

	PETER is hurrying along. KIM in sunning herself

	wonderfully.

				PETER

			(hurrying by)

		Kim! Have you seen Harry?

				KIM

		Sure, lots of times. What a brainiac...

				PETER

		Yeah... have you seen him today?

				KIM

		No, un unh.

				LIZ

			(catching up)

		Peter...!

				PETER

			(keeps walking)

		Hi... have you seen Harry?

				LIZ

		No. What a night, huh?

				PETER

			(laughs)

		Yeah, that was some ride home... must

		have been pretty exciting.

				LIZ

		It was... okay. Look, I got two tickets

		to Les Miserables... wanna go?

				PETER

		Sorry... I'm really busy... I mean, not

		tonight... see you later.

				LIZ

			(thinking)

		Hey, Peter... how did you know about last

		night...?

				PETER

		What about last night?

				LIZ

		My exciting ride with Spider-Man...

				PETER

		Oh... Sorry... I gotta hurry... I have to

		find Harry... I'll see you later.

				LIZ

		Peter!

	PETER runs off. He sees a car approach and flags it.

				PETER

		Hey! Can I get a lift downtown?

				FLASH

		Take your shoes for a walk, Dork.

	FLASH gets out of his car, and crosses the lawn toward

	LIZ.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	OCK is hard at work. The room, still rippled, has been

	"hot rodded" to the max. Lots of jerry-rigged stuff has

	been added.

	OCK takes a sip from the THERMOS and flicks on the small

	TAPE RECORDER.

				OCK

		We are new inserting Peter Parker's data

		on tonight's Planetary Conjunction.

	INSERT: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays Peter Parker's name

	and ID number and the title, "The Planetary Conjunction

	and it's effect on Earth Gravity."

				OCK

		Yes, yes! Go on! Go on!

	INSERT: NUMBER SEQUENCES appear on the SCREEN. Then a

	GRAPHIC of the EARTH moving into line with SATURN,

	JUPITER, the SUN and the MOON. In the corner a NUMBER

	rises.

				OCK

		Enormous. It's enormous.

			(to recorder)

		The Parker calculations add 4%

		gravitational force at the moment of full

		Planetary Conjunction.

			(hits some keys)

		Adding this to present maximum power

		potential, I get...

	He looks up and sees the SCREEN a GRAPHIC "HOLE" opening

	up right through the EARTH! The widening HOLE is

	swallowing everything!

				OCK

		I knew it. I knew it! Universal

		destruction! It's doable! I am putting

		a countdown clock on the Planetary

		Conjunction now!

	A LARGE DIGITAL DISPLAY reads, "13:00:03." The last

	seconds count down to, "12:59:59!"

				OCK

			(playing the computer)

		Okey, dokey. Now let's see if I have

		enough power to drive this beast.

	He starts hitting KEYS on his COMPUTER.

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	PETER is working on LIZ'S COMPUTER. There is a KNOCK at

	his brand new, unpainted DOOR. He hurries to it and pulls

	the KNOB so quickly (forgetting his own strength) that the

	whole assembly comes off in his hand.

				PETER

			(pulling Harry aside)

		I gotta remember to have that fixed.

			(opens the door)

		There you are, I've been looking for you

		all over town.

				HARRY

		What happened?

				PETER

		Where were you?

				HARRY

		I went to the wrestling, wanted to see

		that Amazing Spider-Man, but he didn't

		show up.

				PETER

		Listen, Harry something terrible happened.

				HARRY

		What? What?

				PETER

		My Planetary Conjunction papers... they

		were stolen...

				HARRY

		Oh my God... Are you sure...? Who would

		do such a thing?

				PETER

		Ock...

				HARRY

		Of course... but why...?

				PETER

		We have to find out, sit down.

			(indicates computer)

		I want to access Dr. Octavius' main

		program. I want to know about his

		experiments with the cyclotron. Can you

		do it?

				HARRY

			(starts hacking)

		I can try. I could access the system in

		the dorm. Okay. And through that I

		could crack the main line.

				PETER

		Alright. Now if we can just disrupt the

		Octavius file...

				HARRY

		Okay, let's try.

	HARRY cracks his knuckles like a safe cracker and bends to

	the task. The PHONE RINGS. PETER hits his jerry-rigged

	SPEAKER PHONE. HARRY keeps hacking.

				PETER

		Yeah?

				JAMESON (V.O.)

		Parker? Peter Parker? This is J. Jonah

		Jameson!

				PETER

			(looking over Harry's shoulder)

		Mr. Jameson, you got me at a bad time.

				JAMESON (V.O.)

		I need pictures of your friend, the

		Amazing Spider-Man. But I need bad guy

		shots, you got it? Lots of bad guy shots.

		We're gonna pin that insect to the wall.

		Whaddaya say?

	PETER hangs up. The DIAL TONE cuts off JAMESON.

	INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Only he and the PHOTO ASSISTANT are there.

				JAMESON

		What about that kid? On the job already?

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK is pacing around the hot rodded room. He checks this

	and that. He looks at the COUNTDOWN CLOCK (06:00:10) and

	throws himself down in his CHAIR. He resumes his check-

	down.

				OCK

		Fusion cells...? All up. Internal

		temperature... okay. Risk?

			(a long beat)

		Acceptable.

			(another beat)

		Let's fly.

	He starts flicking on SWITCHES and DIALS. The WHINE whirs

	up. He throws the RED POWER THROTTLE. The POWER DIAL

	goes to 90!

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	PETER and HARRY are at a COMPUTER. The LIGHTS flicker and

	dim. Then they go back on. PETER and HARRY look at each

	other and shrug.

				HARRY

		Got something!

	INSERT: DIGITAL CLOCK display: "06:00:03"

				PETER

		What is it?

				HARRY

		Let me see. It's some kind of countdown

		clock.

				PETER

		Countdown to what?

				HARRY

		I don't know, but whatever it is, it's

		only six hours away.

				PETER

		The Planetary Conjunction?

				HARRY

		Could be...

				PETER

		Or Doc Ock's end of the world experiment...

		Or both!

				HARRY

		Wait a minute. You're not telling me you

		think the world is gonna end tonight...?

				PETER

		You want to wait around till midnight to

		find out?

				HARRY

		No, but...

				PETER

		Let's see what else we've got.

	Another set of numbers roll up on the SCREEN. They are

	accompanied by ELECTRICAL SYMBOLS.

				HARRY

		What's that?

				PETER

		It might be a calculation of the amount

		of power he needs to create the hole

		between the force and the anti-force.

				HARRY

		That's a lot of energy. What could

		generate power like that?

				PETER

		The closest you could come is the New

		York City Subway System.

	Again, the lights flicker and then dim and they return.

	HARRY/PETER

			(together)

		We gotta talk to Professor Rosomorf!!

	INT. BROADWAY EXPRESS - NIGHT

	ROZ boards and takes a seat. There are the usual SUBWAY

	TYPES. A FAT WOMAN. A PIMPLY TEENAGER and his date, a

	TALL SKINNY GIRL in a PARTY DRESS.

	ROZ, making notations in a PAD, takes no notice of them.

	He sits down, closes his PAD, and taps a PENCIL against

	his chin.

				ROZ

		Plutonium...

	EXT. MAJOR INTERSECTION - NIGHT

	TAXIS go by. TWO LOVERS stroll. We hear a familiar

	WHINE. The "WALK" and "DON'T WALK" signs FLASH at the

	same time.

	BOY

	Make up your mind!

	The signs EXPLODE! The COUPLE stops in their tracks. The

	BOY looks at the GIRL.

				GIRL

		What's going on?

	An ARC of ELECTRICITY now shoots between the LIGHT PILLARS

	of the SUBWAY STATION on the corner.

	INT. BROADWAY LOCAL - NIGHT

	SPARKS fly by the window. ROZ, oblivious at first, is now

	stunned by the show.

	EXT. SUBWAY TRAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT

	The ARCS of ELECTRICITY continue to rise. The STREET

	LIGHTS buckle and bend into weird shapes.

				WOMAN

		Oh my God!

				MAN

		Get back! Get back!

	EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT

	TWO TAXIS roar through the intersection and COLLIDE. The

	ETHNIC DRIVERS leap out and begin arguing.

	INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

	PEOPLE SCREAM and fall back as the TRAIN seems to change

	angles.

	EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

	A building ROAR rises from the SUBWAY ENTRANCE. Then the

	sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE! The BOY looks down the STAIRS

	and has to leap out of the way as the BROADWAY EXPRESS

	comes highballing up the STEPS and blasts through the

	SUBWAY entrance.

	The TRAIN sails through the air.

	EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	The TRAIN crashes into the building in a storm of

	cyclotron generated Dali physics.

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	The THROB and PULSE recede. SCREAMS, HONKS, SIRENS can be

	heard.

	EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	A splendidly turned out MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN wakes from her

	satin sleep to see that a SUBWAY TRAIN is in the middle of

	her BEDROOM. The WALL through which the train has come

	sags and ripples like it has melted and partially

	resolidified.

				WOMAN

		Henry!!!

	Several PASSENGERS climb out of the WINDOWS of the TRAIN

	or pry open the DOORS.

				WOMAN

		What are you doing here? Get out of here!

		Get out of here!

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	A CROWD has gathered to gawk and point. They look up and

	we see their POV.

	The MIDDLE CAR of the TRAIN is simply "embedded" in the

	HIGH-RISE, its rear sticking out of the building fifteen

	stories up. From its COUPLING dangles the LAST CAR.

	INT. MIDDLE CAR - NIGHT

	The car is bisected in the middle by the fused brick and

	glass of the WALL of the building. PASSENGERS on the

	outside of the WALL press their faces to the GLASS and

	pound for help.

	ROZ comes to the aid of a MOTHER with TWO CHILDREN.

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	The CROWD sees something else. Swinging high in the sky

	is your friendly neighborhood SPIDER-MAN. The COUPLE and

	TWO DRIVERS argue about what this means.

				WOMAN

		It's Spider-Man!

				TRUCK DRIVER #1

		Get outa here, you bum!

				WOMAN

		Hey, what are you talking about?!

				TRUCK DRIVER #2

			(back at woman)

		What's the matter, lady don't you read

		the papers?

	This is the DRIVER of a DAILY BUGLE truck carrying the

	historically famous Bugle headline, "Spider-Man - Threat

	or Menace?"

				MAN

		Go Spidey! Go!

	INT. LAST CAR - NIGHT

	It's nearly vertical! People are tumbled over each other.

	The scared TEENAGER is tearing at the door. The SKINNY

	GIRL screams in a mechanical way. The DOOR opens. He

	nearly falls!

	The SKINNY GIRL screams again. He manages to get back

	inside. She looks at him, safe now. But she screams

	again anyway.

	ROZ struggles to right himself against a pole. A BAG OF

	GROCERIES goes sliding past him. It continues downward

	and out the OPEN DOOR.

	INSERT: The BAG tumbles down through the air. Down, down,

	and down...

	INT. MIDDLE CAR - NIGHT

	SPIDEY'S face appears in the WINDOW upside down.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Hello, everybody...

	He slides the WINDOW down and flips inside. He walks

	through the parting PASSENGERS to the BUILDING WALL. He

	feels it.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Okay, everyone, stand back and stay cool.

	He hurls himself at the fused GLASS portion and bounces

	back onto the floor. He rolls over, flexing his shoulder.

				WOMAN

			(whining)

		Is that the real Spider-Man?

	SPIDEY does a TRIPLE FLIP to his feet. He reaches up for

	the overhead RAILING and pulls it down easily. Oohs and

	aahs. SPIDER-MAN points it at the GLASS and hefts it.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Somebody wanna give me a hand with this?

	First the WOMAN, and then all of them, take up positions

	on the BATTERING RAM.

				SPIDER-MAN

		On three. One... Two... Three!

	They ram the GLASS and it shatters.

	INT. THE LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	HENRY stands at the open DOOR of the TRAIN in his bedroom

	as they all come rushing through into the room.

	HENRY

	Come on. Come on. That's it. Step

	lively now.

	WIFE

	Henry, the rugs!

	HENRY

	Oh, shut up!

				SPIDER-MAN

		Have a nice evening, Ma'am... and you

		too, Henry.

	EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

	The FIRE TRUCKS arrive and begin assembling a LADDER.

	INT. THE LAST CAR - NIGHT

	SPIDEY arrives at the DOOR at the top of the CAR. He sees

	ROZ at the bottom. THREE PEOPLE are between them. The

	SKINNY GIRL sees SPIDEY. She screams.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Okay, folks, just hang on...

	He scampers down the GRAB-HANDLES to the people below.

	FOUR PASSENGERS cling to SEATS and BARS.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Okay, one at a time. You first, Ma'am...

	A FAT WOMAN makes a "who me?" gesture. SPIDEY throws her

	over his shoulder.

	INSERT: THE COUPLING which holds the two CARS at right

	angles begins to bend open.

	SPIDER-MAN, the FAT WOMAN over his shoulder, goes hand

	over hand to the top and the WOMAN is dumped into the

	MIDDLE CAR.

	INSERT: THE COUPLING bends open a little more.

	SPIDEY helps the TEENAGER and the SKINNY GIRL out of the

	CAR. She takes the dreadful step between cars. She looks

	down. She screams. She steps across.

	EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	The FIRE LADDER is up. But it is about TEN FEET short of

	where it's aimed at. The end of the CAR. A FIREMAN

	stands at its apex.

				FIREMAN

			(into walkie)

		Gimme more ladder! I need more ladder!

	WALKIE

	Negative on that, you're at full

	extension!

	INT. LAST CAR - NIGHT

	Now only ROZ is left. SPIDEY approaches him. He clings

	to a POLE.

	INSERT: The COUPLING bends open! The CAR is hanging there

	from memory!

				ROZ

		This is Doctor Otto Octavius' work. I

		must get back to my university. I must

		stop Ock... he's gone crazy. Can you

		help me?

				SPIDER-MAN

		Sure thing, just don't take the train.

		Come on... give me your hand.

				ROZ

		Spider-Man! Listen to me! If he can do

		this with the train, if he's come this

		far, then I can pretty well predict his

		next step. He'll go to Plutonium SL 270

		for the power. He must be stopped... or

		else he'll destroy our world.

	The COUPLING shrieks and the CAR lurches.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Let's get you out of here first,

		Professor.

				ROZ

		Wait Spider-Man. I don't think I can

		make it... You mustn't waste time saving

		me... you must save the world! You must

		go and stop Ock!

				SPIDER-MAN

		Where can I find him...?

				ROZ

		He is looking for Plutonium SL 270 I'm

		sure...

	The CAR lurches on its side and ROZ flies out of the DOOR.

	SPIDEY THWIPS out a WEB that girdles ROZ'S waist.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Think Rosomorf, think where one can find

		Plutonium? Where could he find SL 270...?

	EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

	ROZ is hanging in mid-air on the WEB.

	ROZ shouts.

				ROZ

			(shouting)

		There's only one place he can get the

		Plutonium SL 270...

				SPIDER-MAN

		Where...?

				ROZ

		Toxic... toxic dump... any toxic dump

		would have SL 270.

	SPIDEY swings ROZ in an arc to the FIREMAN. He misses ROZ

	on the first pass. ROZ looks up at SPIDEY who stands in

	the doorway, manipulating the WEB.

	The FIREMAN grabs ROZ. Then, with an awful SCREECH of

	steel, the CAR pulls loose from the COUPLING. With

	SPIDER-MAN inside it, the CAR plunges ten stories to the

	street below.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	COPS, FIREMEN, PRESS, the works. The CROWD GASPS. CAMERA

	STROBES pop as the LAST CAR crashes to the SIDEWALK. We

	hold several beats on the incredible rubble.

	Then, a WEBBED HAND. SPIDER-MAN groggily pulls himself

	from the wreckage.

				COP (V.O.)

		Put your hands up, Spider-Man.

				SPIDER-MAN

		You're making a big mistake.

				COP

		And you're looking at twenty years.

	SPIDER-MAN shoots a WAD of WEB GOO onto the COP'S GUN and

	leaps up onto the LUXURY CONDO... and swings up out of the

	frame. The COP aims and shoots. The BULLET makes a

	THWUMP noise. The WEB GOO stretches out about three feet

	and falls limp.

				COP

		What the hell!

	EXT. BACK OF BUILDING - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN swings painfully, one handed and limp, at the

	end of a WEB STRAND. After falling ten stories, he is

	groggy and weak. He can't think. He can't focus. He can

	barely hold onto his WRIST GIZMOS. This bug is spent.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Must go on... must find Ock... SL 270

		Plutonium... must get that crazy old

		loony... before he gets to the

		Plutonium... toxic dump... where are the

		toxic dumps...?

	He hangs there with two hands to catch his breath and

	thinks. He shoots a WEB up diagonally and swings across

	on it. This time he catches on and holds, but barely.

	INT. AUNT MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

	LIZ is standing. AUNT MAY is seated on the COUCH, she

	looks weak, pale and alone.

				AUNT MAY

		You're as lovely as Peter said you were.

				LIZ

			(embarrassed)

		Thank you. He really wanted so badly to

		come see you. He called me up out of the

		blue.

				AUNT MAY

			(great concern)

		Tell me about Peter. What's he been up

		to? He seems so preoccupied.

				LIZ

		Oh, you know Peter... he's all caught up

		in some kind of study he's doing. Things

		are really crazy at the university now.

		Things are crazy... everywhere. I guess

		Peter's just... well, you know... pulled

		into his shell.

				AUNT MAY

			(reminiscing)

		When Peter was little, he loved to hide.

		In the closets. Under the sink. He

		always needed a secret place. But when

		I'd look for him, he'd always laugh... he

		wanted to be found.

				LIZ

		Yeah... well. I don't think he wants me

		to find him... Well, I'd better be going.

		My friend Flash is picking me up.

				AUNT MAY

		This Flash... he isn't your boyfriend, is

		he?

				LIZ

		No... not really... I think you can guess

		why...

	They smile knowingly at each other.

	LIZ goes toward the DOOR.

				AUNT MAY

		Elizabeth...?

		She turns.

				AUNT MAY

		Finders keepers, losers weepers.

				LIZ

		What?

				AUNT MAY

		That's what I used to say to Peter when I

		found him.

	EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN swings high above it. This is not the

	confident swinger with LIZ in his arms. This is a guy

	who's making it by the narrowest of margins. There is a

	traffic jam below.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Got to find Ock... got to find the toxic

		dumps.

			(grabs his head)

		Oh! Oh! Oh... yeah!

	He looks down at the traffic. We PAN across the many CARS

	until we come to a non-descript GREEN CAR.

	INT. GREEN CAR - NIGHT

	OCK is honking the HORN. Something lands on his ROOF.

	Then SPIDEY sticks his head, upside down, in the

	windshield.

				SPIDER-MAN

		What's up, Ock?

				OCK

		You!!!

	A WALDO smashes through the WINDSHIELD but misses SPIDEY.

	OCK leaps from the CAR.

				OCK

			(on the run)

		You're a doomed bug, Wall Crawler. I've

		no time to waste on you now.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	OCK runs through HONKING TRAFFIC. SPIDER-MAN leaps from

	CAR to CAR.

	OCK turns to see SPIDER-MAN leap to a LIMO at the curb.

	OCK turns tail and runs down an alley. A FEMALE COP pops

	out of a DOORWAY. Her partner, a BIG, YOUNG COP, pulls

	his GUN.

				FEMALE COP

			(gun poised)

		Alright! Freeze! Up against the wall

		and spread 'em

	OCK complies. He raises his hands... and spreads the

	WALDOS to full extension! The BIG COP screams and faints.

	The little FEMALE COP'S eyes POP. OCK swats the GUN from

	her hand. He starts to choke her.

	SPIDEY comes swinging to the rescue. He lands on the ROOF

	nearby.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Hey, you big OCK, why don't you pick on

		someone your own size?!

				OCK

		Alright Spider-Bug... here I've come for

		you...

	OCK leaves the COP and attacks SPIDER-MAN, shooting his

	iron fist at him. OCK runs to the end of the alley.

	SPIDEY staggers to his feet and resumes the chase.

	OCK breaks into a red Corvette convertible, starting it

	with a WALDO.

	SPIDER-MAN comes out in time to see the Vette drive away.

	A CHINESE LAUNDRY TRUCK is passing. SPIDEY THWIPS it and

	is whipped away.

	He crawls over to the WINDOW.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Hey, driver. Could you follow that red

		Vette for me?

	The surprised CHINAMAN lets loose a stream of CHINESE

	expletives, complete with appropriate suggestive gestures.

	SPIDER-MAN crawls to the top of the TRUCK and surveys the

	situation. He sees a sea of moving traffic. He THWIPS up

	a WEB and swings away.

	SPIDEY swings along from BUILDING to BUILDING. The RED

	VETTE is making headway. Suddenly, SPIDER-MAN spots a

	blue MG with its top up.

				SPIDER-MAN

			(swinging)

		Flash Thompson... I never thought I'd be

		happy to see you.

	EXT. BLUE MG - NIGHT

	SPIDEY swoops down on the BLUE MG.

	INT. BLUE MG - NIGHT

	SPIDEY wedges down into the car, right between FLASH and

	LIZ. She WHOOPS. FLASH is thrilled.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Sorry about that!

				FLASH

		Spider-man! This is unbelievable...!

				SPIDER-MAN

		Flash, I need your help.

				FLASH

		You got it.

				SPIDER-MAN

		You any good with this thing?

				FLASH

		I'm the best.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Okay... catch that Vette!

				FLASH

		Roger, wilco, over and out.

	He swerves. SPIDEY falls all over LIZ. They begin to

	careen through traffic, three peas in a very small pod.

	EXT. WEST SIDE CAR CHASE MONTAGE - NIGHT

	With SPIDEY jammed in between LIZ and FLASH, the MG chases

	the VETTE. Since neither OCK nor FLASH is any good at

	this, both cars quickly careen into POLES, FENCES, HOT DOG

	CARS and begin falling apart.

	On RIVERSIDE DRIVE the MG begins to lurch and STEAM. The

	VETTE looks eaten away. The GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE

	looms ahead.

	The VETTE roars through the TOLL BOOTH. They spot OCK

	stuck in traffic.

				FLASH

		Why is he going to New Jersey, and who is

		it in that shitty red car...

				LIZ

		Don't you recognize him... it's Ock!

				SPIDER-MAN

		New Jersey has the largest toxic waste

		dump in the world.

				FLASH

		What does he want with toxic waste?

				SPIDER-MAN

		He's looking for Plutonium, my dear...

		The car has to slow down... it's in a traffic jam.

				FLASH

		Sorry... can't do anything about this

		traffic.

	SPIDER-MAN jumps out of the car.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Try to stay with me. I don't want to

		lose him!

	Speeding along the BRIDGE, OCK sees no one. But high

	above, SPIDEY swings from TOWER to TOWER after him. At

	the last TOWER, SPIDEY leaps down onto a BIG TRUCK. The

	VETTE weaves and SPIDEY crosses to another BIG TRUCK. For

	a moment he is caught between the TWO TRUCKS, but he makes

	it across.

	The VETTE takes an exit. SPIDEY leaps to the next SIGN.

	He aims his WRIST GIZMO and waits for the next car to take

	the exit, but none does. Deflated, he drops to the

	ground. He looks up to see a sign on a CYCLONE FENCE. It

	says, "DUMP NUMBER 7 -- KEEP OUT -- RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!"

				SPIDER-MAN

		Bingo.

	INT. TOXIC WASTE DUMP - NIGHT

	The landscape has a nightmarish vision, weirdly lit by

	"safety lights." VATS and DRUMS ooze all kinds of bad

	stuff. A light is on in a dilapidated SHACK.

	INT. THE SHACK - NIGHT

	OCK is tossing away the CANISTERS until he comes to one

	marked, "HAZARD!! PLUTONIUM SL 270 HAZARD!!"

				OCK

		Okey, dokey...

				SPIDER-MAN

		Open that now, and you'll spoil Christmas.

	SPIDEY'S peering in from a HOLE in the ROOF.

				OCK

		Insect! I am going to squash you to

		death... Once I lay my Waldos on your

		skinny bones...

	OCK hurls a DRUM at SPIDEY. It erupts in a sizzle of

	LIQUID and GAS. Then the SIX-ARMED FIEND runs for the

	door with his SL 270.

	EXT. THE SHACK - NIGHT

	OCK comes flying out and SPIDER-MAN grabs a WALDO.

	SPIDEY does a back flip and whips OCK so hard the WALDO

	snaps off! OCK recoils it and reacts in horror.

	With a roar, OCK attacks SPIDER-MAN. They battle as

	SUPER-ADVERSARIES. OCK gains the upper hand and tosses

	SPIDEY into a pile of RUSTING DRUMS. A GAS envelopes

	SPIDER-MAN and he begins coughing.

	EXT. THE DUMP - NIGHT

	OCK'S WALDOS are coiled around SPIDER-MAN'S neck as the

	WEB SLINGER is dragged through the dump. His WHITE EYES

	narrow and blink. There is a capped WELL behind a WARNING

	SIGN. OCK tears off the CAP and then hurls the groggy

	SPIDEY down the WELL.

				OCK

		Goodbye, Spider-Man!

	INT. THE WELL - NIGHT

	SPIDEY falls. He cannot grab onto the slimy WALLS. At

	the bottom of the foul pit is a bubbling BLUE luminescent

	POOL. SPIDEY claws frantically at the WALLS.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Noooooooooooooo!

	He gets a hold and slides down to within a foot of the

	POOL. Its weird light shines up at him. He looks up at

	the starry sky.

				SPIDER-MAN

			(to himself)

		Okay now, Spidey. Easy does it.

	He shoots a WEB about halfway up the PIT. It hits the

	wall, sizzles, and drops back down.

				SPIDER-MAN

			(to himself)

		Don't give up, Spidey. Don't give up.

	The WEB GIZMO squirts out a pathetic patooey of WEB GOO.

	Then it hisses, empty!

				SPIDER-MAN

		Empty... now what do I do?

				OCK

		So you've avoided the nuclear pool, have

		you, Spider-Man?

				SPIDER-MAN

		Well, so far so good. But I can't hold

		on much longer.

				OCK

		Pity...!

				SPIDER-MAN

		Oh, come on, Ock, be a good sport. Let's

		talk this over face to face... throw me a

		line...

	SPIDEY reaches out.

				OCK

		Okay... face to face... Catch this!

	OCK, way up at the opening above, raises a huge DRUM above

	his head. The DRUM leaks toxic waste in ORANGE TENDRILS.

	He is about to drop it down on SPIDER-MAN...

				FLASH

		Don't do it, Professor!

	We now see FLASH and LIZ in the BLUE MG.

				OCK

			(puts down the drum)

		I know you... and you, young lady. Both

		of you are in my physic class, aren't

		you...? Come... you can help me. I need

		to get some of these drums to my

		laboratory... help me... and I'll give

		you special grades. What'd you say?

	Suddenly he catches FLASH with a WALDO and starts to choke

	him. LIZ screams and tries to help FLASH.

				LIZ

		Leave him alone!!!

	Another WALDO grabs her.

	ROZ now appears on the scene.

				ROZ

		Leave them alone Otto!

				OCK

		But, they won't help me. Everybody is

		trying to destroy my experiment. And so

		are you, Rosomorf.

	Another WALDO grabs ROZ by his arm.

				ROZ

		Otto... I was wrong. I've gone over your

		research. It's brilliant, Otto. It's

		mad, but it's brilliant. You have much

		work left to do. I want to help you,

		Otto. For the sake of science, go and do

		your experiment. Leave... these kids

		alone and I'll help you.

				OCK

		You will? You too?

	Both FLASH and LIZ shake their heads okey dokey. OCK

	gestures to FLASH and LIZ.

				OCK

		Help me with these drums, I need to get

		them to my laboratory immediately.

				ROZ

		Do as he says.

	OCK pushes FLASH and LIZ with his iron arm. Gripping LIZ

	be her hair, he shoves her into the CAR.

				OCK

		Drive, Flash, before I flush your girl

		right down the toilet!

				SPIDER-MAN

		Professor Rosomorf, it's no good, double

		dealing... why did you help him...?

	ROSOMORF finds a rope and looks into the well.

				ROZ

		Don't lose your energy screaming. Catch

		this rope and climb up, come on!

	INT. ROZ'S CAR - NIGHT

	They drive along the highway. SPIDEY is recovering,

	working his neck.

				ROZ

		I've been through the Octavius data. He

		has enough power with his Plutonium.

		Especially if he gets his hands on

		Parker's data, there he has enough power

		to do what he wants to do. And we are

		not going to stop him in time before the

		Planetary Conjunction occurs tonight...

				SPIDER-MAN

		Stop the car. I have an idea.

	They're in the middle of RIVERSIDE DRIVE but a PHONE BOOTH

	is coming up on the right.

	INSERT: ROZ'S foot stabs the BRAKE.

	INT. ROZ'S CAR - NIGHT

	SPIDEY gets out of the car. Then he pats himself where

	his pockets ought to be.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Do you have a dime?

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	HARRY is there, working on the COMPUTER, PHONE RINGS,

	HARRY picks up.

				PETER

		Harry?!

				HARRY

		Peter, where are you?

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

				SPIDER-MAN

		Listen, Harry. You must get my paper

		before Ock uses it...

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				HARRY

		Your Planetary Conjunction data? It's

		too late... Ock's got your paper, it's in

		his computer already.

	INSERT: The COMPUTER SCREEN displays a graphic of the SUN,

	EARTH, and MOON lining up with JUPITER and SATURN.

				HARRY

		But don't worry... he can never use it

		without Plutonium.

				SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)

		He's got the Plutonium, and he's on his

		way back to the lab! And he's got two

		prisoners with him... Liz and Flash!

				HARRY

		Don't worry... he needs a huge amount of

		power... thousands of volts of

		electricity... to get to the Anti-Force.

				SPIDER-MAN

		He can get to the power. Electrical

		power... to the max. Nuclear power... SL

		270. And now, at the moment of full

		Planetary Conjunction. When all the

		planets line up with the sun... maximum

		gravitational power. The Conjunction is

		Ock's final power source.

				HARRY

		Damn... the Conjunction is due at

		midnight! What are we going to do?

	EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT

	The BLUE MG arrives and comes to a stop. OCK looks at his

	two prisoners in the back seat and smiles to himself...

	Picks up one DRUM on each shoulder.

				OCK

		Okey, dokey... have fun, young ones...

		for the last time.

	OCK leaves. LIZ and FLASH are tied together in the back

	seat of the CAR.

				LIZ

			(still ministering)

		What do we do now?

				FLASH

		We kiss the world goodbye. If he is

		right, all there is left to do is...

				LIZ

		Wait... I think I can release my right

		hand...

	INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				HARRY

		How much time is left? Wait... I can

		find out... my God... 59 minutes!

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

				SPIDER-MAN

		The only way we can interfere with Ock's

		plan is to find a computer center... fast.

				HARRY (V.O.)

		Our University has the biggest center in

		town.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Yeah, but who's gonna work 'em?

	EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT

	Professor OCK comes for some more drums. He sees that LIZ

	and FLASH have disappeared. OCK picks up TWO DRUMS.

	HARRY seeing FLASH and LIZ come running to the school

	grounds.

				HARRY

		I think I can get some help... I can

		teach anyone how to work a code in five

		minutes.

				SPIDER-MAN (V.O.)

		Then do it!

	INT. COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT

	The LIGHTS are off, but the COMPUTERS are on. HARRY looks

	over LIZ'S shoulder as she cracks through a code. Her

	SCREEN reads out, "CONNECTICUT. TECH. Fully Op, Line

	Backlog, Security Max Level." The last line is FLASHING.

				KIM

		Hey, this is easy.

	They all run from COMPUTER to COMPUTER.

				FLASH

		Hey, Harry I need help.

				HARRY

		Coming!

	HARRY types in KARNAKY LTD and gets the same response. He

	looks at his DIGITAL WRISTWATCH. "01:00:02" becomes

	"00:59:59" as we watch. Then a WARNING BUZZER!

				KIM

		I got one! I got one!

				LIZ

		Harry! Get over here!

	HARRY hurries to KIM'S side and elbows her out of the

	CHAIR. The SCREEN is flashing "WARNING, Security Breach!"

	HARRY'S hands fly over the keys. The KIDS gather around.

	LINE DRAWINGS of the CYCLOTRON (progressing from large to

	small detail) appear one after the other. Finally, a

	PIPE. There is a CIRCLE around a JOINT. And the legend

	"H20".

				HARRY

		A goddamn water leak...

				FLASH

		Hey, look at this. Empire State

		University. This is our cyclotron,

		right?

				HARRY

			(serious)

		What does it say?

				FLASH

			(hits two keys)

		It says "no information on net."

				HARRY

		Damn... we can't do it...

				KIM

		You mean... we can't stop loony Ock...

				HARRY

		I mean the world is in danger...

				FLASH

		We must find Peter, he knows these

		computers better than all of us.

				HARRY

		Yes, but where the hell is he?

				LIZ

			(mysteriously)

		I bet he is with Spider-Man...

	Suddenly the lights dim. A heavy noise. An earth quake.

	EXT. OUTER SPACE - PERPETUAL DARK

	The EARTH is moving into line with the other PLANETS of

	the CONJUNCTION.

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	HARRY and FLASH and LIZ and KIM, (the EARTH is SHAKING)

	come out running from the building beneath an enormous

	HANGING MOON. They are frightened.

	Suddenly it all stops. It's quiet, the kids look at the

	sky.

				LIZ

		Look at the moon... I have never seen it

		so big.

				FLASH

		What is that...

				HARRY

		Must be the sun.

	We now see the sky. With the sun on one side, and the

	moon on the other. They watch it, shocked, frightened out

	of their wits.

	EXT. END OF THE WORLD MONTAGE - NIGHT

	Suddenly from OCK'S basement lab a BLUE BEAM of LIGHT

	breaks through. A WHINE starts, it moves magically out of

	the WINDOW and PANS around a sleepy NEW YORK which doesn't

	know that the end is upon it. The dreaded WHINE builds

	throughout! People stop in their tracks, look up to the

	strange looking skyline. Camera comes down to a street

	where ROZ is DRIVING SPIDER-MAN fast toward the

	UNIVERSITY.

	INT. ROZ'S CAR - NIGHT

	ROZ looks out over the skyline of NEW YORK. Lighted

	buildings FLARE UP and then GO DARK. The LIGHTED SPIRE of

	the Empire State Building FLARES UP and EXPLODES.

				SPIDER-MAN

		It's started. Step on it Professor, or

		we'll never make it.

	They look across the campus and a strange LIGHT is coming

	out of the SCIENCE CENTER.

				ROZ

		Our campus... right there... see those

		beams from Ock's lab. We're late... it's

		coming... the Conjunction will happen in

		a few seconds.

	SPIDER-MAN massages his arm.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Stop the car...! Come with me.

				ROZ

		Where...? What...?

	SPIDER-MAN SHOOTS out a WEB and flies toward the SCHOOL

	BUILDING taking ROZ with him.

	INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT

	It is a patchwork of make-shift repairs. OCK looks in

	through a WINDOW that's been melted out. He is lost in a

	mad rapture.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	RED POWER THROTTLE is at 95% POWER!

	SPIDER-MAN and ROZ enter, shielding their eyes from the

	GLARE. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:08:18".

				OCK

			(looking back, madly)

		Aha! You never included the Conjunction

		in your calculations, did you?! Rosomorf!

				ROZ

		Damn the calculations! My God, Otto, you

		have to hear me! The world we know will

		collapse! Everything we have devoted our

		lives to... all the patterns, all the

		harmonies... everything will be destroyed.

				OCK

		A new world waits! Rosomorf! It is my

		destiny!!!

				ROZ

		It is cosmic suicide! You have no right!

	ROZ flings himself through the MELTED WINDOW into the

	EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER. He grabs for the "BULLET" but the

	WALDOS grab him and throw him back. ROZ staggers

	backward... into the arms of SPIDER-MAN.

				ROZ

		You have to stop him... Spider-Man you

		have to stop him.

				SPIDER-MAN

		I'm afraid we're too late.

	SPIDER-MAN attacks OCK, trying to push him away from the

	THROTTLE. OCK pushes SPIDER-MAN away from him so strongly

	that SPIDER-MAN is knocked down. OCK nudges the POWER

	THROTTLE forward and the WHINE increases to an ear

	shattering pitch. The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:06:48".

	We are at 96% POWER!

	EXT. THE SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	We PAN down from the MOON to a STREET full of SIRENS and

	SHADOWY FIGURES running in the night. LIZ and KIM and

	HARRY come nearer. A very WEIRD light is emanating from

	the CENTER.

				LIZ

		He's in there. I know Peter is in there.

		She breaks into a run.

				FLASH

		Liz, don't... Liz come back... come back!

		LIZ runs inside. They run after her. A BOLT OF

		ELECTRICITY flashes across the doorway, stopping them.

	INT. THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The PLANETS are playing on the COMPUTER SCREEN. Things in

	the room begin to rise, weightless. The ENERGY STORM is

	brewing!

				OCK

		Okey, dokey!! My energy storm has

		started. My Anti-Force is on! History

		is being made... Spider-Man, Rosomorf

		cheer up friends... we're on our way to

		the unknown cosmos... we three are about

		to visit heaven... real Gods heaven.

				ROZ

			(sees the sky through the window)

		Spider-Man! The Conjunction! It's

		happening!

	EXT. THE SKY - STRANGE COLORS - NIGHT

	The CONJUNCTION is now happening.

	INSERT: Surreal DIALS spin madly.

	INT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	LIZ runs into a HALLWAY gone berserk. Stuff is flying

	everywhere. TILES pull from the WALLS and crash to the

	ceiling.

				LIZ

		Peter! Peter, where are you?!

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK throws the RED POWER THROTTLE to 97% POWER.

	Cacophony! The "BULLET" begins to PULSE and THROB! The

	DIALS spin! The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:05:58".

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	The FULL MOON hangs over the building. FLASH and HARRY

	and KIM stand at the entrance to the CENTER.

	FLASH starts to run to the building.

				FLASH

			(screaming)

		Liz! Liz come on out!

	They run forward but as they reach the FRONT STEPS the

	building lurches upward. The bottom step becomes a wall

	of STONE and DIRT, six feet high.

				HARRY

		Get back! Flash... get back!

				FLASH

		Wow...!

	Then the building lurches upward again! This time it

	pulls FREE from the ground. The KIDS take cover as WATER

	LINES BURST and ELECTRICAL WIRES SPARK.

	INT. SCIENCE CENTER HALLWAY - NIGHT

	LIZ opens a door.

				LIZ

		Peter!

	The building lurches throwing her back across the HALL

	where she crashes through another door.

	INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - NIGHT

	All manner of stuff is flying around. LIZ comes sliding

	across the floor. She crashes into a CABINET. GLASSWARE

	starts to fall on her, but crashes into the CEILING

	instead. She is dragged up the WALL. She kicks and

	screams against the Anti-Force.

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	FLASH, KIM and HARRY look on as heavy ELECTRICAL CABLES

	stretch upward to the rising CENTER and then snap in

	showers of sparks. As they fall away the CENTER becomes

	airborne. The CABLES wave up at it, shooting arcs of

	ELECTRICITY directly at the building.

	INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - NIGHT

	LIZ slides down the WALL. She grabs at the WINDOW and

	looks out. The rest of the university recedes beneath

	her, now a hundred feet below. And they're still rising!

	FLASH and HARRY look up.

				FLASH

		Oh my God... Liz is inside there!

				HARRY

		And Professor Rosomorf and crazy Ock.

				FLASH

		What about Peter? Is he there with them?

				HARRY

		No, but I bet Spider-Man is.

	EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

	People look up at the SCIENCE CENTER. A CYCLIST, riding

	and looking, crashes into a TAXI. MAX REISS leaps out

	with the BEAUTIFUL STARLET from the TAXI.

				MAX

		That's some show... if ever I saw one.

	INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	He's looking out his window seeing the University's Lab

	Building flying by. Up and up toward the sky.

				JAMESON

			(shouting)

		Tear out the front page! Change the

		headline... The biggest news is happening

		right now... we need photos... a camera...

		get me a camera...!

	EXT. SKY - NIGHT

	A very long shot of the SCIENCE CENTER rising into the

	CLOUDS.

	INT. AUNT MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	She pulls aside a CURTAIN and watches the SCIENCE CENTER

	rise.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	OCK works the COMPUTER as the CONSOLE sends up SHOWERS of

	SPARKS. He glances at the "BULLET" which now PULSES.

	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK at "00:04:18".

				ROZ

		Where is it going Otto?

				OCK

		Other worlds, Roz, other times, other

		dimensions, who knows? Who cares?

				ROZ

		Then... why?

				OCK

		Truth, Rosomorf. Look at it! The new

		truth! The new way!

				SPIDER-MAN

		Don't listen to him Professor Roz.

				OCK

		No, you don't listen to that clown, he

		can't save you, or the world for that

		matter.

	A WALDO reaches in and rips ROZ off SPIDEY, flinging him

	back against a WALL. ROZ lands in a heap beneath a FIRE

	STATION (HOSE, EXTINGUISHER, AXE).

	We see the WALDO reach out for SPIDER-MAN. It wraps

	around his FOOT and begins to tug, slowly...

				OCK

		Once and for all, Spider-Man... once and

		for all we'll end the legend of your

		powers.

	OCK knocks SPIDER-MAN with a real BIG BLOW with his WALDO.

	OCK is slowly dragging SPIDER-MAN to a HUGE HOLE that's

	been ripped in the floor by the BEAMS of ELECTRICITY.

	We see New York a half a mile down through the hole. We

	see SPIDEY being drawn across the HOLE. Then ROZ comes

	flying in with the FIRE AXE.

	ROZ hacks away at the WALDO and chops it off! The stump

	withdraws. OCK examines it in pain and fury!

				OCK

			(ultimate betrayal)

		You!! You were my teacher!!!

	ROZ doesn't even look back. He and SPIDEY are at the edge

	of the HOLE and he's shaking SPIDEY furiously.

	OCK sends out his other WALDO and begins banging it on the

	floor in a frenzy on either side of ROZ and SPIDEY. Like

	a child denied, he smashes his steel fists against the

	floor again and again.

				OCK

		You were my teacher! And you want to

		destroy my experiment. You are a

		scientist for heaven sake... don't you

		want to know what's up there?

				ROZ

		Yes, but not on account of our world. We

		have only one world... only one life.

		The floor begins to craze and then crack like ice around a

		hole on a pond. BANG! BANG! SPIDEY comes to just as the

		section of floor beneath himself and ROZ gives way and

		falls through.

	SPIDEY grabs hold of the edge and dangles. He looks down

	and sees ROZ falling away beneath him, disappearing into

	the dark.

				ROZ

			(calling back from the dark skies)

		Spider-Man! Only you can save us now...

				SPIDER-MAN

		Roz!!!

			(turns to Ock)

		Murderer!!!

				OCK

		Forget that old fool, insect. My

		Spider-Man... Come join me on my

		fantastic voyage to the 7th heaven.

	EXT. OUTER SPACE - PERPETUAL DARK

	The PLANETS are virtually in line!

	INT. SCIENCE CENTER HALLWAY - NIGHT

	LIZ comes running through it. A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY

	shoots from the right to the left in front of her. She

	slams on the brakes and runs the other way.

				LIZ

		Peter! Peter!

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at, "00:02:59". OCK throws the

	POWER THROTTLE to 98% POWER. He laughs and a WEB splats

	against his GLASSES. SPIDEY scrambles to his feet. OCK,

	still trying to get the WEB GOO off his GLASSES, is

	slammed into the CONSOLE by SPIDER-MAN. SPARKS fly and

	WALDOS flail blindly, smashing things. OCK tears off his

	GLASSES and squints through the FIRE and SMOKE and GLARE.

	SPIDER-MAN THWIPS the ceiling and swings into a drop kick!

	OCK recovers. He grabs SPIDEY and slam dunks him through

	the hole in the floor.

	EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE BUILDING - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN falls through the air. He shoots up a WEB and

	THWIPS, it sticks to the ROCKY bottom of the FOUNDATION.

	OCK appears in the HOLE. He sees SPIDEY'S dilemma,

	hanging on a thread of WEB. A half-broken WALDO snakes

	down and CLIPS the WEB.

	But the WEB sticks to the WALDO! OCK shakes it, but he

	can't get loose. SPIDER-MAN shoots out another WEB at the

	ROCK BOTTOM and, with the leverage, he pulls OCK out.

	OCK swings down in a wide arc and his WALDOS catch on the

	ROCK upside down. He holds on fiercely.

	OCK scrambles out to the side of the CENTER and begins

	looking for an entry. SPIDER-MAN is right on his tail.

	The building pitches sideways! OCK turns to face SPIDER-

	MAN, his broken WALDOS out for BATTLE.

	SPIDEY grabs an EXPOSED PIPE and breaks it off,

	brandishing it like a broad sword.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Let's have it, old boy!

		A bizarre DUEL takes place. The CENTER pitches this way

		and that. SPIDEY and OCK move from foothold to foothold,

		from WINDOW to LEDGE to PARAPET.

	Now the CENTER pitches to a 45 degree angle. They DUEL

	upside down! A WINDOW GRATE crashes open and LIZ comes

	flying out, holding onto the GRATE for dear life!

				SPIDER-MAN

		Liz!!

		OCK seizes the opportunity to whack SPIDEY across the

		head. SPIDEY loses his footing but the building now

		lurches back and LIZ goes flying back inside. SPIDEY

		ducks inside too and pulls the GRATE.

	SPIDER-MAN uses his great strength to move a HUGE PIECE of

	SCIENTIFIC MACHINERY in front of the GRATE.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Come on.

				LIZ

		Where's Peter? He must be here somewhere.

				SPIDER-MAN

			(pulling her ahead)

		He's around, don't worry... we'll find

		him.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at, "00:01:00" as SPIDEY comes

	flying in with LIZ in tow.

				LIZ

		This building is flying. I'm in a

		goddamn flying building...

				SPIDER-MAN

		I think we have to pull some of these

		cables. Try those over there. I'll work

		on these. We gotta slow this thing down

		somehow. We got helicopters coming.

	LIZ looks at some WIRING, apprehensive about even touching

	it.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Pull!

	She yanks out a CABLE. The building pitches. But when

	SPIDEY pulls one out, it rights itself.

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	The BIG BEAMS start cutting out one by one. The CENTER

	begins to PITCH and YAW. The CHOPPERS are getting closer.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK reads, "00:00:15" as SPIDEY and LIZ

	continue to pull WIRES and CABLES. TWO WALDOS erupt

	through the floor and grab SPIDEY. They pull SPIDEY to

	the floor. Entangled in these molybdimum pythons, SPIDEY

	struggles valiantly. LIZ leaps to his aid.

				LIZ

		Oh my God...

	A third WALDO, a broken one, snakes up from the HOLE and

	begins feeling blindly around on the CONSOLE for the POWER

	THROTTLE.

				SPIDER-MAN

		The power!

	LIZ sees the damaged WALDOS heading for the RED THROTTLE.

	The COUNTDOWN CLOCK is at "00:00:10". LIZ leaps and tries

	to wrestle it away. It whips in her arms and she holds on

	tight. It bangs her against the wall and then the

	CONSOLE. She holds on. "00:00:03". The WALDO crashes

	LIZ against the wall which erupts in SPARKS. She lets go

	of it. It heads for the POWER THROTTLE! "00:00:01!"

	SPIDER-MAN can't break the grip of the WALDOS, but he can

	pull with super-human strength. He yanks OCK up through

	the STONE floor. OCK hits the ceiling of the CONTROL

	ROOM. ONE WALDO grabs on. The other one throws the RED

	POWER THROTTLE!

				OCK

		Spider-Man. You're end is coming. Life

		in its present form is ending... new

		dimensions, new horizons...

	The UNIVERSAL BULLET begins to GLOW. The GLOW sharpens to

	a POINT of LIGHT. SPIDER-MAN holds on tight against a

	rushing ENERGY FLOW that's pulling everything in the room

	towards the POINT of LIGHT.

				LIZ

			(bracing against the storm)

		What is happening?

				SPIDER-MAN

			(similarly braced)

		I don't know!!!

	LIZ starts to slip away into the flow. She struggles

	against it.

				LIZ

		I can't... hold on!

	SPIDEY THWIPS her and she grabs onto the WEB.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Hold tight, Liz, hold tight!

	OCK drops calmly, beatifically, to the floor of the room.

	He moves slowly, under his own power, into the LIGHT.

				OCK

			(spaced out)

		You cut my power... there's too little

		power... It's so tiny... so tiny...

		there's only space... for me. But I've

		done it, Spider-Man. I have broken

		through... I've broken through!

				LIZ

		Don't do it, Dr. Octavius!

				OCK

		Okey... dokey... Now that's what I call

		an experiment!!!

	As he nears the LIGHT he actually becomes a part of it.

	He radiates LIGHT. He shimmers and shines. He fills the

	room with BLINDING LIGHT.

	SPIDEY and LIZ shield their eyes, and as the light

	diminishes, the storm subsides. They're safe. Except for

	the fact that they're in a floating building, 10,000 feet

	above the city!

	EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - NIGHT

	Against the backdrop of the MOON, a SQUADRON of

	HELICOPTERS approaches the CENTER. From their POV, a HUGE

	CRACK opens across the face of the building. The CENTER

	begins to drop in PULSING SURGES.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	SPIDER-MAN is at the CONSOLE pulling and putting back

	WIRES. LIZ, fascinated, looks in at the WINDOW where OCK

	disappeared.

				SPIDER-MAN

		I can't control her. She's dropping too

		fast! Alright... let's go!

				LIZ

		But what about Peter? We've got to find

		Peter!

				SPIDER-MAN

		Peter will be okay, I promise you...

		Let's go before it's too late.

			(he grabs her)

				LIZ

		Go where?

	EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT

	It rotates and drops. The HELICOPTERS come in like the

	cavalry.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	Trying to leave it, LIZ and SPIDEY are confronted with a

	nightmare. The room is tilted at a 45% angle. PIPES are

	bursting. SPIDEY helps LIZ through the obstacles. Debris

	rains down. They come face to face with a diagonal maze

	of PIPES.

				SPIDER-MAN

		Maybe there's another way...

	A HUGE CRACK opens above them.

				LIZ

		It's breaking apart!

				SPIDER-MAN

		Alright, keep moving, a step at a time!

	They scale the maze, but as they emerge on the other side,

	half the floor falls away! Central Park awaits, 8,000

	feet below.

				LIZ

		We have to go back.

				SPIDER-MAN

		We can't go back.

	He looks across at the door. It is midway up a diagonal

	wall. He shoots a WEB up at the ceiling between

	themselves and the door. Then he extends a hand to LIZ.

				LIZ

		Forget it...

				SPIDER-MAN

		Okay, have it your way.

	He swings across and lands on the LEDGE of the DOOR. Then

	he swings the WEB back to her like a trapeze.

	LIZ catches the WEB and looks across at SPIDER-MAN,

	furious.

				LIZ

			(shouting across)

		What am I supposed to do with this!

				SPIDER-MAN

			(shouting back)

		Go ahead. It's easier than it looks!

		We've got to try the fire escape.

	LIZ swings across like TARZAN and SPIDEY gathers her in on

	the LEDGE. She does a comic "phew" and the LEDGE buckles

	beneath them but holds. SPIDER-MAN tries to open the

	door, but it's stuck.

				LIZ

		The door is stuck.

	SPIDER-MAN bends his back to the task. It take all his

	strength, but with a comic AAAAARGGHH! He bends the DOOR

	open.

	EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

	They burst out onto the ROCK FOUNDATION of the building.

	New York is rushing up to meet them. The WIND created by

	their fall buffets them. The HELICOPTERS arrive, and the

	falling building plunges right past them. The HELICOPTERS

	look across at each other, helpless.

	EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT

	It drops like a stone.

	EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT

	SPIDEY and LIZ are falling away from the DOOR, sliding

	along the ROCK. LIZ is stopped by a RETAINING WALL.

	SPIDEY keeps sliding. He THWIPS the wall and then

	disappears over the edge. LIZ screams!

	LIZ fights to her feet and grabs onto the WEB STAND. She

	pulls on it with all her strength. She pulls and pulls

	and pulls. We see the WEB running up between the ROCKS.

	She gives one last pull and comes up with an EMPTY WEB

	END.

	A long, long beat.

				PETER (V.O.)

		Liz, Up here!

	LIZ looks up and sees PETER hanging out the WINDOW two

	stories above her. He throws out a ROPE LADDER. LIZ

	grabs it. She begins to climb.

	INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT

	PETER pulls LIZ through the WINDOW. There is no time for

	an embrace.

				PETER

		Come on. I've found a way down.

				LIZ

			(at long last, love)

		I knew you were going to say that.

	They run out of the ROOM. We PAN down and see, crumpled

	beneath the WINDOW, the SPIDER-MAN suit.

	INT. LARGE PHYSICS LAB - NIGHT

	This is the LAB we saw in the opening sequence. PETER has

	turned on the lights. He's got a handful of ROPE.

				LIZ

		Where's the way out?

				PETER

		Right there!

	We are looking at the HUGE AMERICAN FLAG.

				PETER

		Come on, help me with this.

	EXT. THE FOUNDATION - NIGHT

	LIZ is already down the ROPE LADDER and is holding it for

	PETER. He comes down with a HUGE bundle of RED, WHITE &

	BLUE.

				PETER

		Okay, stand still.

	He ties some ROPE around her waist.

				LIZ

		Is this going to work?

				PETER

		How do I know?

				LIZ

		I just adore confidence in a man.

				PETER

		Come on...

	They move to the edge of the ROCK and look down. CENTRAL

	PARK is still a couple thousand feet down.

				LIZ

		What is it you say when you jump?

				PETER

		Your prayers.

	They SCREAM as the building lurches again, knocking them

	to the ground. They start to slide across the ROCK. They

	reach out for each other but their hands don't quite

	reach.

	Slowly, they inch back together, but the FOUNDATION cracks

	between them.

	EXT. THE CENTER - NIGHT

	It spins and falls beneath us. Down, down it goes. And

	then it crashes into the GREAT LAWN. A huge cloud of

	debris shoots upward.

	EXT. THE SKY - NIGHT

	There is a beautiful FULL MOON. PETER and LIZ float down

	into the frame lit by its wonderful light.

	The AMERICAN FLAG which has turned into a huge parachute.

	They hold each other tight. They can hear SIRENS below.

	They begin to laugh with relief. Then they stop. The

	wind billows LIZ'S skirt and plays with PETER'S hair, and

	snaps in the AMERICAN FLAG.

				LIZ

		We have a lot to thank your friend

		Spider-Man for.

				PETER

		Somehow, I don't think we've seen the

		last of him.

				LIZ

		Peter...! Finders, keepers...

				PETER

		What...? What is it? Why do you look

		like that?

				LIZ

		I think I'm in love.

				PETER

			(even his eyes blush)

		You are...

				LIZ

		With your friend...

				PETER

		Spider-Man? You're in love with

		Spider-Man?

				LIZ

		I am... you think we'll see him again?

				PETER

		We might... you never know.

		He kisses her.

				LIZ

		Oh.

			(bittersweet)

		This may be the end of a beautiful

		friendship you know?

				PETER

		Nah.

	They land in the center of the park under the parachute.

	They stay there and kiss... completely covered by the

	flag. Camera pulls up to show the building floating away.

	THE END
