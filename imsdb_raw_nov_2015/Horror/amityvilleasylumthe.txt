          We slowly pan through a suburban neighbourhood located on

          the south shore of Long Island. The still shroud of night

          blankets the village of Amityville in the early morning

          hours.

          Stray house pets are the only signs of life as families and

          neighbours slumber. We reach 112 Ocean Avenue, a large Dutch

          Colonial house. The home is a classic piece of Americana,

          two stories plus an attic, several rooms, and a boathouse on

          the Amityville River. There are quarter round windows on the

          top floor that give the appearance of eyes staring back at

          us.

          A signpost in the front yard reads "HIGH HOPES", a testament

          to what the home symbolizes for the family that live there.

          2.INT. BASEMENT  112 OCEAN AVENUE  CONTINUOUS

          We move slowly through the basement, past various crushed

          beer cans and a table full of drug paraphernalia, until we

          reach a bearded man in his early twenties. RONALD DEFEO

          JUNIOR, known to his family and friends as BUTCH. He sits on

          a ragged sofa, dozing off in front of a small Television

          that displays white static.

          There is a digital clock on a small table by the side of the

          sofa. It reads 3:14am. We hold on the clock and the time

          changes to 3:15am. We can see DeFeo's breath drift from his

           3.

          lips as cold air sweeps through the room. His eyes snap

          open.

          A hooded figure, face shrouded in darkness, steps from the

          shadows. The figure carries a .35 caliber lever action

          Marlin 336C rifle. Hands clad in black leather gloves, the

          mysterious person holds the rifle out in front of Butch. A

          voice emerges from beneath the hood that is so deep as to be

                         INHUMAN:

                          FIGURE

           Kill them. Kill them all.

          Butch stands and takes the rifle. The figure retreats back

          into the shadows.

          3.INT. HALLWAY  CONTINUOUS

          The house is silent. Butch quietly stalks the hallways, the

          rifle grasped tightly in his hands.

                         CUT TO:

          4.INT. MASTER BEDROOM  CONTINUOUS

          Butch quietly pushes the door aside and observes his parents

          as they sleep. RONALD DEFEO SENIOR, age forty three, is a

          heavy set Italian American man and his wife LOUISE DEFEO is

          a slender woman, aged forty two, with flowing blonde hair.

          Both are lying flat on their stomachs. Without hesitation,

          Butch raises the rifle to his shoulder and pulls the

          trigger. The BLAST is deafening. The first shot rips into

          his fathers back, tearing through his kidney and exiting

          through his chest. Butch fires another round, again hitting

          his father in the back. This shot pierces the base of Ronald

          Senior's spine, and lodges in his neck.Louise DeFeo's eyes

          open, but she barely has a few seconds to react. Butch aims

          the weapon at his mother as she lays prone on the bed, and

          fires two shots in quick succession. The bullets shatter her

          rib cage and collapse her right lung. Both bodies now lay

          silently in fresh pools of their own blood.

          Butch, in an almost trance like state, walks down the hall

          and quietly nudges the door to another bedroom.

                         CUT TO:

          6.INT. BOY'S BEDROOM  CONTINUOUS

          Butch enters the bedroom that his two brothers MARK, aged

          twelve, and JOHN, aged nine, share. He walks between their

          two beds as they lie on their stomachs, sleeping soundly.

          Standing directly above his two helpless brothers, Butch

          fires one shot into each of the boys as they lay sleeping.

          The bullets tear through their young bodies, ravaging their

          internal organs, laying waste to the lives that lay ahead of

          them. Mark lays motionless, while John, whose spinal cord

          has been severed by his brother's heartless attack, twitches

          spasmodically for a few moments after the shooting.

                         CUT TO:

          7.INT. HALLWAY  CONTINUOUS

          Stangely, the loud shots have not roused the remaining

          members of the DeFeo family, and Butch skulks unchallenged

          to his final destination-the bedroom shared by his sisters

          DAWN, eighteen years old, and ALLISON, aged thirteen.

          8.INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM  CONTINUOUS

          As Butch enters the room, Allison stirs. She looks up just

          as Butch lowers the rifle to her face and pulls the trigger.

          Butch then aims his weapon at Dawn's head and squeezes the

          trigger again, literally blowing the left side of her face

          off. Both girls die instantly. The white sheets and walls

          are splattered with blood and brain matter. Butch is unmoved

          and expressionless. He surveys the carnage for a moment,

          then calmly walks out of the room.

           5.

          Butch walks past a photograph hanging on the wall in a red

          frame. It shows all seven members of the DeFeo family in a

          group, hugging each other with smiles on their faces. The

          sound of children singing the nursery rhyme "Ring Around a

          Rosie" in a slow, haunting manner echoes through the house.

          We push in on the photograph and:

          A young girl in her mid twenties is driving the car. She is

          attractive yet she dresses very conservatively in a thick

          sweater and baggy combat trousers. This is LISA TEMPLETON.

          She consults a crumpled piece of paper. Directions are

          building which casts a dark shadow over the grounds. Outside

          a sign reads HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL.

          Lisa is sat on a bench in a long empty corridor. She has a

          file in her hand and taps her fingers on it nervously. A

          door opens and a middle aged man dressed in a crisp white

          shirt and tie steps out. He is well groomed and his eyes are

          warm and inviting. This is DOCTOR ELLIOT MIXTER.

                          MIXTER

           Lisa Templeton?

          Lisa stands abruptly, dropping her file in the process.

                          LISA

           Me! Sorry-

          Lisa scrambles to pick up the file and papers fall out of

          it.

                          LISA

           Shit!

          Mixter smiles.

                          LISA

           Oh God, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to

           say that!

                          MIXTER

           It's quite alright. I'm Doctor

           Elliot Mixter. Come into my office.

          Lisa manages to retrieve the file and papers from the floor

          and compose herself. Mixter holds the door open and Lisa

          enters the office.

          14.INT. MIXTER'S OFFICE  CONTINUOUS

          Lisa stands in the office. Mixter enters and shuts the door.

                          MIXTER

           Please, take a seat.

          Lisa sinks into a chair next to a large oak desk. Mixter

          walks to the opposite side and sits in a large leather chair

          facing her.

                          LISA

           I've uh... brought my resume and

           some references. I know I already

           sent a copy with my application but

           just in case.

           7.

                          MIXTER

           Thank you.

          Mixter takes the file from her and opens it on his desk. He

          glances over it.

                          MIXTER

           Very good. I see you've had lots of

           experience cleaning private homes.

                          LISA

           Yes, I uh... I've done a lot of

           them.

                          MIXTER

           Well an institution such as this

           one is a very different

           proposition.

                          LISA

           Oh yes. Yes I know. You'll see I've

           also worked cleaning a school, so I

           am used to big areas.

                          MIXTER

           Yes I've seen that. When I say this

           is a different proposition I mean

           in terms of the sensitivity

           required due to the nature of what

           we do here.

                          LISA

           Oh yes, yes of course.

                          MIXTER

           You would mainly be working night

           shifts at a time when patients are

           on lock down. But many of our

           patients here have psychological

           disturbances so there may be

           situations where you have to clean

           up things you may not be used to

           cleaning up. If you know what I'm

           saying.

                          LISA

           I know what you mean, yes.

                          MIXTER

           Would that bother you?

                          LISA

           It may be strange at first but I

           actually have some experience in

                          8

          that area. I would clean my mother

          when she lost control of her bodily

          functions during her illness. It's

          something I got used to very

          quickly. It became routine.

                          MIXTER

          I see. How is your mother now?

                          LISA

          Well... she passed away.

                          MIXTER

          I'm sorry to hear that. So... it's

          important to me that every employee

          here, whether they are a

          psychiatrist, an orderly or a

          cleaner, needs to fully understand

          what our mission statement at this

          hospital is.

                          LISA

          Okay.

                          MIXTER

          High Hopes was only built two years

          ago and as an institution we have

          only been running for just over a

          year now. So we're still building

          our reputation. But I am very clear

          on what I want that reputation to

          be. I intend to make this

          institution one of the foremost

          centres for mental health treatment

          in the country. If you look into my

          history you'll know that I have a

          stellar reputation in the field of

          psychiatry and I want to use that

          to help others. That is why I have

          put my own money into the creation

          of this institution. We are only

          just starting out but we have a

          long term ambition to be considered

          the best. So what I require is that

          every person who works at this

          institution, in any capacity, must

          be professional and sensitive to

          the needs of the patients. Unlike

          other institutions, the welfare and

          care of our patients comes first

          here.

           9.

                          LISA

           I really admire that and I promise

           I would not let you down if I was

           given this job.

                          MIXTER

           I'm sure you wouldn't.

          Lisa's face quickly contorts. Mixter looks puzzled. Suddenly

          Lisa sneezes. It shoots out so rapidly she has no time to

          cover her mouth and nose. She sneezes all over Mixter. Lisa

          looks horrified.

                          LISA

           Oh my God, I'm so sorry!!

          Lisa rushes to Mixter's side and grabs a tissue from a

          Kleenex box on his desk. She frantically wipes the saliva

          and snot from his face.

                          MIXTER

           It's quite alright, please sit

           down, I can take care of it.

          Lisa, completely mortified, sits back down. An unimpressed

          Mixter wipes the spittle off his face with a tissue. When

          he's done he stares at Lisa.

                          MIXTER

           Okay... well thanks for coming in.

           I'll let you know.

                          LISA

           Look I'm so sorry, I really am!

                          MIXTER

           It's fine. We'll be in touch.

          Such is her embarrassment, Lisa can't get out of the office

          fast enough.

           NANCY (O.S)

          You should take my advice and show

          a little cleavage at these

          term, maybe I should go back to

          school. Get better qualified for

          something.

           NANCY (O.S)

          How come you don't do something

          with your writing? You could try

          and get something published. Or

          write a book or something?

                          LISA

          I dunno, I just... it's like I just

          haven't been able to bring myself

          to write since ... you know...

           NANCY (O.S)

          I know. It's a cliche, but time

          really is a healer. I'm sure the

          passion you had for it will come

          back.

                          LISA

          Maybe.

           NANCY (O.S)

          You wanna talk about it?

                          12

                          LISA

           Not really. I just think I'm gonna

           get myself a nice big tub of ice

           cream from the freezer and watch

           some TV.

           NANCY (O.S)

           Comfort eating!

                          LISA

           [Smiles] I know but if there's ever

           a good time for ice cream it's

           today!

           NANCY (O.S)

           Can't argue with that! Give me a

           call tomorrow, let's go for coffee

           soon yeah?

                          LISA

           Sure. Night.

                         CUT TO:

          16.INT. KITCHEN  LISA'S HOME  LATER

          Lisa is rummaging in her freezer for some ice cream. She

          pulls out a tub and tosses it on the counter. She opens the

          cutlery drawer and grabs a spoon. The phone rings.

                         CUT TO:

          17.INT. LIVING ROOM  CONTINUOUS

          Lisa walks over to the phone and picks up the receiver.

                          LISA

           Hello?

           MIXTER (O.S)

           Lisa this is Doctor Mixter at High

           Hopes Hospital.

                          LISA

           Really? Oh, I uh... Hi!

           MIXTER (O.S)

           Hello! I'm just calling you to say

           it was great to meet you today and

           I'd like to offer you the job.

           13.

          Lisa is stunned into silence.

           MIXTER (O.S)

           Are you there?

                          LISA

           Um... is this a joke or something?

           MIXTER (O.S)

           No joke, I'd like to offer you the

           job.

                          LISA

           Seriously?

           MIXTER (O.S)

           Absolutely.

                          LISA

           Oh my God I... I can't believe it.

           MIXTER (O.S)

           I'm pleased to welcome you to High

           Hopes Hospital. If you can be here

           at 9am tomorrow for an induction

           please and we'll go from there.

                          LISA

           Oh God, thank you so much! I really

           appreciate this, I won't let you

           down!

           MIXTER (O.S)

           I know you won't. We'll see you

           tomorrow!

                          LISA

           Okay, see you tomorrow!

          Lisa puts the phone down with a smile.

                         CUT TO:

          18.INT. RECEPTION AREA  HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL - DAY

          Lisa enters the hospital. A man in his thirties dressed in a

          boiler suit is stood on a step ladder. He is attempting to

          change a light bulb in the hallway but seems to be making

          hard work of it. The bulb drops from his hand and smashes to

          the ground. Lisa looks up at him.

                          14

                          MAN

           Gswno!

          Lisa averts her eyes but the man is now aware of her

          presence. He has a Polish accent but his English is very

          articulate.

                          MAN

           Can I help you?

                          LISA

           Yeah, I'm here for an induction

           into the cleaning job.

                          MAN

           You must be Lisa?

                          LISA

           Yes, that's right.

                          MAN

           Doctor Mixter said you would be

           coming. I'm Delaney, we'll be

           working together.

                          LISA

           Oh great.

          Delaney climbs off the step ladder and shakes Lisa's hand.

                          DELANEY

           We work nights so today we'll just

           show you around, okay?

                          LISA

           Okay, thank you.

                          DELANEY

           I'll clean this up and we'll get to

           it.

                         CUT TO:

          19.INT. STORAGE CUPBOARD  LATER

          Delaney opens the cupboard door and for a moment he and Lisa

          are silhouetted in the doorway. Delaney pulls a string

          hanging near the door and a light comes on. The cupboard is

          packed with various cleaning products.

                          DELANEY

           This is the storage cupboard.

           Everything you will need for each

           15.

          task is here, each shelf is

          labelled.

                          LISA

          Okay.

                          DELANEY

          The most obvious task is hoovering.

          This is our hoover here, it's

          straight forward. You'll be

          surprised that although it's

          powerful it's very quiet, because

          we are working when everyone's in

          bed so obviously we don't want to

          wake them up! It has a Telescopic

          suction tube and six stage filter

          system. So a lot more powerful than

          you may be used to.

                          LISA

          Okay.

                          DELANEY

          The mop and bucket is here, we

          usually use standard bleach to mix

          with the water so that's straight

          forward. But there is this

          specialist stain remover that you

          must use if there are any stains on

          the floor or carpet. It needs to be

          sprayed and left to set for twenty

          minutes before scrubbing or

          mopping. It's a special formula for

          tea, coffee, water marks and other

          yellow and brown discolourations on

          the carpets or floors. It's pretty

          strong so wash your hands after you

          use it!

                          LISA

                         OKAY

                          DELANEY

          One of the worst parts of the job

          is we have to remove chewing gum

          from lots of surfaces. They don't

          just stick it underneath the

          tables, it ends up everywhere!

                          LISA

          Gross!

                          16

                          DELANEY

           Yes! I think a lot of the time it's

           the staff doing it, not the

           patients! But we have this GumCart,

           which is a bit complicated but it's

           easier than just scraping the gum.

           The steam is super heated to one

           hundred eighty degrees and

           delivered at seven point zero bar

           pressure. It can produce a hundred

           and fifteen litres of superheated

           steam per minute.

                          LISA

           Is it okay if I watch you use it a

           few times first so I know exactly

           what I'm doing? I don't want to end

           up burning myself or any furniture!

          Delaney smiles.

                          DELANEY

           No problem. Now here we come to the

           most dangerous chemical we have.

           This is a concrete cleaner, very

           toxic stuff, so you have to wear

           the face mask and gloves we have

           here, okay?

                          LISA

           Okay.

                          DELANEY

           This is for cleaning and descaling

           brick, stone and concrete and for

           metal de-rusting. For concrete you

           must mix it one part to four parts

           water. Brush or spray it on with

           the equipment here then leave it

           five to ten minutes to set, then

           rinse it off. But for those

           stubborn son-of-a-bitch marks use

           it neat!

                          LISA

           Okay.

                          DELANEY

           Don't worry if anything seems

           complicated, you'll get used to it.

           But you'll mostly be mopping and

           hoovering in your first few weeks.

           17.

                          LISA

           Yeah that's fine.

                         CUT TO:

          20.INT. WARD B  LATER

          Lisa follows Delaney into the communal area of Ward B. The

          walls are white and clinical. Various patients are scattered

          across the room, each with a look of resignation in their

          eyes. Many stare blankly out of the window.

                          DELANEY

           This is Ward B, one of two wards

           you'll be responsible for cleaning

           each evening. Essentially the main

           duties will be emptying the bins,

           hoovering the carpeted areas and

           mopping the hallways. The patients

           in here are Category B. They're

           mainly people who have had nervous

           breakdowns and those who are

           catatonic. They're harmless. Like

           Missus Hardesty here.

          Delaney and Lisa walk over to an old woman who is sat still

          in the chair. Her eyes are open yet she appears lifeless.

                          DELANEY

           Hello Missus Hardesty.

          No response or acknowledgement of other people's presence.

                          DELANEY

           She hasn't spoken a word in all her

           time here. The orderlies just lift

           her from the bedroom to the day

           room and back again every day.

                          LISA

           Why did you just talk to her?

                          DELANEY

           We've still got to treat them like

           human beings. Otherwise they just

           become like furniture and we all

           lose our humanity. I like to think

           she can hear me, even if she won't

           talk to me. See you later Missus

           Hardesty.

                          18

          Missus Hardesty continues to stare into nothingness. Delaney

          and Lisa exit.

                         CUT TO:

          21.INT. HALLWAY  CONTINUOUS

          Delaney and Lisa stroll down the long corridors.

                          DELANEY

           The patients are locked in their

           rooms on our night shift, but now

           and again they might have an

           accident we gotta clean up.

                          LISA

           Okay.

                          DELANEY

           In the day time there are nurses

           who often clean up but in the night

           we may be called to provide fresh

           linen or mop up. Not the most

           pleasant of jobs but it happens

           from time to time.

                          LISA

           Yeah I understand.

          Delaney and Lisa arrive at a doorway.

                          DELANEY

           Now here we come to the most

           difficult part of the job.

                          LISA

           Cleaning crap up isn't the most

           difficult part?!

          Delaney smiles.

                          DELANEY

           Oh no, that's very easy compared to

           what's behind this door.

                          LISA

           What's behind it?

                          DELANEY

           This leads down to Ward X.

           19.

                          LISA

           Sounds ominous.

                          DELANEY

           You could say that. It's where

           Category A patients are held. The

           criminally insane.

                          LISA

           Really? Doctor Mixter didn't

           mention that.

                          DELANEY

           Yes, well, these patients are

           beyond help so they've become athe

           hospital's secret. Many of them

           were transferred from prisons and

           other institutions. Doctor Mixter

           probably thought he could help

           them. He can't. The staff call this

           place Blood Row.

          Delaney opens the door.

                         CUT TO:

          22.INT. STAIRCASE  CONTINUOUS

          Lisa follows Delaney down a winding staircase. As they

          descend down the steps, the light fades.

                         CUT TO:

          23.INT. WARD X  CONTINUOUS

          Delaney and Lisa enter a long dark corridor with a row of

          thick metal doors either side. Two light bulbs hang from the

          ceiling at each end of the corridor, providing only minimal

          illumination. Lisa's nose twitches.

                          LISA

           What's that smell?

                          DELANEY

           It always hangs in the air. No

           matter how much we bleach the floor

           there is always that smell of

           death.

                          20

          Lisa looks concerned.

                          LISA

           These patients are dangerous?

                          DELANEY

           Yes. But don't worry, we never have

           to interact directly or anything

           like that. You will just be mopping

           the corridor and dusting.

          Delaney walks over to the first door on the right. There is

          a hatch on the door. Delaney slowly slides it open and

          beckons Lisa over. She peers inside. The cell is very basic,

          white walls with the only furniture being an uncomfortable

          looking bed and a toilet without a seat. There are thick

          iron bars on one small window. A skinny man in his thirties

          sits on a basic bed in a white vest, rocking back and forth.

          He has wild hair and a scraggly beard.

                          DELANEY

           That's Jerry Kimble. He was

           convicted of stabbing a young

           mother forty-nine times in front of

           her two year-old son, then killing

           and sexually assaulting a woman

           before smothering her four-year-old

           daughter. They call him the Green

           Chain Rapist. He was in Sing Sing

           but was certified insane and his

           lawyer got him transferred here. He

           doesn't make any noise or fuss, but

           he is a dangerous man. Especially

           towards women. This next inmate is

           even worse.

          Delaney slides the hatch shut and walks over to the next

          door. He slowly slides open the hatch and Lisa peers inside.

          Another basic white cell with only a bed and toilet. A man

          stands in the centre of the room with his hands behind his

          back. His hair is slicked back, as jet black as the eyes

          that stare at Lisa. He smiles. Delaney slides the hatch

          shut.

                          DELANEY

           That's Dennis Palmer. Also known as

           The Long Island Cannibal. He was

           abused as a child so his targets

           were always paedophiles and

           rapists. He'd track them down and

           torture them. He would eat parts of

           their body while they were still

           alive.

           21.

                          LISA

           That's horrible.

                          DELANEY

           The most horrible thing is that a

           lot of the public thought he was a

           hero.

          Delaney walks over to a door on the opposite side of the

          hallway. He slides open the hatch.

                          DELANEY

           Sadie Krenwinkel.

          Lisa looks inside. Inside the basic cell a woman sits cross

          legged on her bed. She has long flowing black hair, intense

          eyes and a pentagram carved into her forehead. She looks up

          and smiles at Lisa. Delaney slides the hatch shut.

                          LISA

           What's her deal?

                          DELANEY

           She was a member of a Witchcraft

           cult. They kidnapped six people for

           a demonic ritual. Five were killed

           but one got away and led police to

           the cult. She turned her trial into

           a circus, talking about lots of

           crazy stuff. The media enjoyed it

           but she got certified insane by the

           court. She's been around a few

           institutions since. Now she's here.

                          LISA

           Some strange stories here.

                          DELANEY

           Well those aren't the strangest.

                          LISA

           Really?

                          DELANEY

           This last patient is the strangest

           case.

          Delaney walks over to the last door on the left. He slides

          open the hatch. A singular shaft of light coming from a tiny

          barred window barely penetrates the darkness of the cell.

          Lisa peers inside to see a man sat in the shadows.

                          DELANEY

           This is our resident John Doe.

           Sometimes we have people with

                          22

           amnesia. Often we find out who they

           are. Not so with this man.

                          LISA

           Why is he down here?

                          DELANEY

           They first brought him in about six

           months ago. No one knows where he

           came from, he literally just turned

           up late one night. An orderly found

           him wandering the grounds. First of

           all he was like Missus Hardesty

           upstairs-catatonic. Then a few

           weeks later he started to respond

           to Doctor Mixter and the nurses

           through facial expressions and

           gestures. But soon, he got violent.

           Very violent. He'd have bursts of

           rage and beat other patients. One

           day he appeared to have a seizure

           and collapsed. A young doctor tried

           to take his vital signs. Patient X

           here throttled him so hard he

           crushed his larynx. It took six

           orderlies to restrain him. Now they

           won't even let him out for the

           obligatory hour a day exercise. We

           still don't know who he is.

                          LISA

           Oh God.

          Delaney stares at Lisa.

                          DELANEY

           God has nothing to do with this

           man.

          Delaney slams the hatch shut. Lisa looks disturbed.

                          DELANEY

           I haven't put you off have I?

                          LISA

           I guess not... it's just a lot to

           take in. I've obviously never been

           around stuff like this before.

                          DELANEY

           This is the reality of this place.

           We don't deal with these people

           directly but we may have to clean

           up their mess. If you can't handle

           23.

           that then I understand. You know

           that it's not too late to back out?

          Lisa considers for a moment.

                          LISA

           I'm not a quitter.

          25.INT. WARD B  CONTINUOUS

          Lisa hoovers the carpet in the empty communal room. She then

          empties the bins. A Clock on the wall ticks towards 3:15am.

                         CUT TO:

          26.INT. HALLWAY  A LITTLE LATER

          Lisa is mopping. As she reaches the end of the hallway a

          young girl walks around the corner carrying a teddy bear.

          Lisa is STARTLED.

                          LISA

           Ooh, you made me jump! Should you

           be out of bed this late?

                          GIRL

           I don't know.

          The girl has flowing blonde hair and an angelic face, yet

          there is a haunting sadness in her eyes.

                          LISA

           I don't think you should be.

                          GIRL

           Do you want to play with me?

                          LISA

           I'd love to sweetheart, but it's

           very late now. I think you better

           go back to bed.

                          24

                          GIRL

           Okay.

          The girl walks away.

                         CUT TO:

          27.INT. STORAGE CUPBOARD  NIGHT

          Lisa is returning the mop and bucket to the storage

          cupboard. She knocks a bottle off the shelf and leans over

          to pick it up.

          POV SHOT: Someone is approaching Lisa, edging closer and

          closer. A hand stretches out and touches her shoulder. Lisa

          JUMPS and SMACKS her head on the underside of the bottom

          shelf.

                          LISA

           Fuck!!

          Lisa turns around to see Delaney standing there.

                          DELANEY

           Sorry, I didn't mean to startle

           you.

                          LISA

           It's okay.

          Lisa rubs her head.

                          DELANEY

           Are you okay?

                          LISA

           Yeah, just hurt that's all!

                          DELANEY

           Sorry.

                          LISA

           I'll live.

                          DELANEY

           Do you want to grab a coffee?

                          LISA

           Sure.

                         CUT TO:

          28.INT. HALLWAY  LATER

          Delaney and Lisa are sat on a bench in the hallway sipping

          coffee from plastic cups.

                          DELANEY

           Did you change the bins in the Day

           Room?

                          LISA

           Yeah.

                          DELANEY

           Good. I've got a light bulb to

           change in Room Twelve upstairs

           soon. We're making good time.

                          LISA

           Cool. It's funny, I never thought

           I'd get this job. The interview

           didn't go well!

                          DELANEY

           Doctor Mixter told me you were the

           only person he interviewed for the

           job.

                          LISA

           Really?

                          DELANEY

           Yeah. I'm sure he felt you were

           right for the job and didn't need

           to interview anyone else.

                          LISA

           Cool.

          Lisa looks down at a distinctive tattoo on Delaney's wrist.

                          LISA

           Nice tattoo.

          Delaney pulls his sleeve down to cover it up.

                          DELANEY

           Oh yeah. I forget I have it

           sometimes.

                          26

                          LISA

           What does it mean?

                          DELANEY

           Well... it represents a lot of

           wrong turns in my younger years.

                          LISA

           Like what?

          Delaney doesn't answer and takes a long sip of coffee.

                          LISA

           Sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

                          DELANEY

           It's okay. Let's just say the past

           is better left there.

                          LISA

           Fair enough.

                          DELANEY

           So how is the first night going for

           you?

                          LISA

           Not bad. I ran into a young girl in

           the hallway earlier. Sweet little

           girl, she was only about twelve or

           thirteen. I told her to go back to

           bed. I guess they don't lock the

           kids in at night huh?

          Delaney appears confused.

                          DELANEY

           You sure it was a young girl of

           that age?

                          LISA

           Yeah definitely. She was carrying a

           teddy bear. She was about thirteen

           at the most.

                          DELANEY

           Umm... okay.

                          LISA

           What?

                          DELANEY

           Well... there are no children of

           that age here.

           27.

          Now it's Lisa who is confused.

                          LISA

           What?

                          DELANEY

           In fact, there are no children of

           any age in this place. I think our

           youngest patient is about twenty.

                          LISA

           You're kidding right?

                          DELANEY

           No, I'm serious.

                          LISA

           Then who was that girl in the

           hallway?

          Delaney contemplates for a moment.

                          DELANEY

           You sure you saw a girl that young?

                          LISA

           I'm positive.

                          DELANEY

           I better tell the orderlies. This

           is no place for a little girl to

           be.

                         CUT TO:

          29.INT. WARD B  LATER

          Lisa is polishing a table. Delaney walks in with

          HARDCASTLE,a well built man with a skinhead and visible

          tattoos on his arms.

                          LISA

           Did you find her?

                          DELANEY

           No.

                          HARDCASTLE

           So you're the one who saw the

           little girl huh?

                          28

                          LISA

           Yes.

                          HARDCASTLE

           You sure you saw a little girl?

                          LISA

           Of course.

                          HARDCASTLE

           Well I've had to pull staff off

           other wards to search this goddamn

           place top to bottom. We found

           nothing.

                          LISA

           That's strange.

                          HARDCASTLE

           A big fucking inconvenience is what

           it is! Do me a favour, the next

           time you think you see something be

           absolutely sure before you go

           running to Jumpsuit here! I ain't

           got time to be running around this

           place looking for shit that isn't

           there! You understand??

                          LISA

           Yes.

          Hardcastle exits. Lisa looks embarrassed.

                          LISA

           Sorry.

                          DELANEY

           Don't worry about it. Better safe

           than sorry.

          30.INT.STAIRCASE  HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL-NEXT NIGHT

          Lisa walks tentatively down the staircase carrying a mop and

          bucket. A clock on the wall reads 3:15am.

          31.INT. WARD X  CONTINUOUS

          Lisa walks into Ward X. She looks down the dimly lit hallway

          and pauses for a moment. Overcoming her nerves, she places

          the bucket on the floor and starts mopping.

          As she edges through the hallway Lisa notices a light

          flickering from underneath one of the cell doors. She walks

          over and slowly reaches for the hatch. Sliding it open Lisa

          peers inside. In the centre of the floor she sees a needle,

          a piece of paper and a piece of red wool surrounded by Six

          lit candles. She looks around and nobody seems to be in the

          cell.

          Suddenly SADIE jumps up right in front of the hatch! Lisa

          FALLS backwards, letting out an involuntary SCREAM! She

          stumbles to her feet as Sadie laughs. Lisa slams the hatch

          shut and rushes towards the exit.

                         CUT TO:

          32.INT. STORAGE CUPBOARD  NIGHT

          Delaney is sifting through a tool box. Lisa stands in the

          doorway.

                          DELANEY

           Hey, can you do me a favour?

                          LISA

           What?

                          DELANEY

           Can you empty the rubbish in Doctor

           Mixter's office? I've got to check

           the boiler, there's been complaints

           about the heating not working.

                          LISA

           No problem.

          Lisa grabs a roll of bin bags from the shelf.

                         CUT TO:

          33.EXT.MIXTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          Lisa knocks on the door.

                          30

                          LISA

           Doctor Mixter? Hello?

          She knocks again. No answer. Lisa tentatively turns the

          handle. The door slowly creaks open. The office is empty.

          Lisa walks in.

                         CUT TO:

          34.INT. MIXTER'S OFFICE  CONTINUOUS

          She looks around for the bin, finally locating it by the

          side of the desk. Lisa pulls the full bag out and ties it up

          before replacing it with a new bag. With her task complete,

          Lisa's curiosity gets the better of her. She looks around

          the office. There is a shelf full of psychology books and a

          filing cabinet. Lisa touches the top drawer of the filing

          cabinet and it opens.

          Lisa looks at all of the names on the files and finds one

          marked 'Patient X'. She reaches for it and suddenly a HAND

          grabs her shoulder! A startled Lisa turns around. An orderly

          in his thirties is stood in front of her. He is thin but

          muscular, with slicked back hair. This is PEMBERTON.

                          PEMBERTON

           here?

                          LISA

           Uh... I was just emptying the

           garbage.

                          PEMBERTON

           Funny, I don't remember Doctor

           Mixter keeping the garbage in the

           filing cabinet.

                          LISA

           Look I... it was just open and I ...

           I dunno.

                          PEMBERTON

           Well, y'know I'm gonna have to

           report this.

                          LISA

           Oh please don't, I didn't see

           anything I just opened it.

          Pemberton smiles.

           31.

                          PEMBERTON

           Well new girl, it's hospital policy

           to report this kind of thing.

                          LISA

           But I've only just got this job and

           I really need it.

          Pemberton looks her up and down.

                          PEMBERTON

           Perhaps we can come to some

           arrangement.

                          LISA

           What do you mean?

                          PEMBERTON

           Well, I'd be doing you a big favour

           if I kept this to myself. So

           perhaps you can do me a favour.

                          LISA

           What kind of favour?

                          PEMBERTON

           A blow job.

          Lisa's face contorts with disgust.

                          LISA

           You're disgusting!

          Lisa tries to leave the room but Pemberton stands in her

          way.

                          PEMBERTON

           Oh come on, I bet you'd love it.

                          LISA

           Look, you better get out of my way

           or I'm going to report you for

           sexual harassment.

                          PEMBERTON

           You've been working here for five

           minutes. You really think Doctor

           Mixter is gonna believe a fucking

           cleaner over a medical

           professional?

                          DELANEY

          Pemberton spins around. Delaney is stood in the door way.

                          DELANEY

           Leave her alone.

          Pemberton laughs.

                          PEMBERTON

           She ain't no prisoner here! I was

           just talking, what's the problem?

                          DELANEY

           No problem. Lisa, come with me,

           we've got a job up on Ward B.

          A grateful Lisa brushes past Pemberton and exits the room.

          Delaney glares at Pemberton for a moment before leaving the

          room. Pemberton smirks.

           You okay?

                          LISA

           I'm fine. It was just a little bit

           intimidating, y'know?

                          DELANEY

           Pemberton can be like that. He

           works nights with that other son-

           of-a-bitch Hardcastle. They like to

           throw their weight around. You'll

           get used to it.

                          LISA

           People like that shouldn't be in

           charge of patients.

          steps down and walks past a clock on the wall. The time hits

          3:15am.

          Lisa walks into the day room and is STARTLED to see Mrs

          Hardesty sat in a chair.

                          LISA

           Missus Hardesty, you scared me!

           What are you doing up at this time?

          No response from the catatonic pensioner.

                          LISA

           Sorry, I forgot you don't talk.

           I'll just go and get an orderly.

          Lisa heads for the exit. Missus Hardesty's head turns to

          look at her and her mouth opens. An unnaturally deep voice

                         EMERGES:

                          MRS HARDESTY

           You're going to die in here.

          Lisa stops in her tracks. She slowly turns to face Mrs

          Hardesty, who stares blankly into space.

                          LISA

           What did you say?

          Lisa stares at her but there is no response.

           Yeah. She even spoke to me!

          Hardcastle bursts out laughing.

          Hardcastle steps out into the hallway. A few moments later

          Hardcastle re-enters the day room with Pemberton.

                          LISA

           Hello?

          Lisa looks around. The hallway is empty. She walks forward

          and turns the corner just in time to see the young girl,

          carrying a teddy bear, push open the door. She enters the

          staircase that leads down to Ward X.

          Lisa pushes open the door to Ward X. She peers down the dark

          hallway. The girl is nowhere to be seen.

                          LISA

           Little girl?

          Lisa slowly walks down the hallway, passing the cell doors.

          She can hear whispering. Lisa is drawn to the last door on

          the left. She approaches with caution. Stood in front of the

          door she slowly slides the hatch open and peers inside. John

          Doe sits in the corner, cloaked in shadow. Lisa peers down

          and in the centre of the floor, illuminated by a single

          shaft of light from the small window, is a TEDDY BEAR. Lisa

          slides the hatch shut and walks backwards. She is seriously

          unnerved. As she steps back from the door she hears a

          whispering from Kimble's cell. She edges closer to his cell

          door and listens.

           KIMBLE (O.S)

           Palmer... Hey Palmer...

          Palmer can be heard from the next cell. His voice is calm,

          in stark comparison to Kimble's which sounds extremely

          agitated.

           PALMER (O.S)

           Yes?

           KIMBLE (O.S)

           My cock is so hard Palmer. It's so

           hard that I can't contain it any

           more. I'm going to break through

           this wall and do bad things to you.

           Very, very bad.

           PALMER (O.S)

           I must advise you Mister Kimble-

           threats will not be well received.

           I'm touching myself Palmer. You

           Stay out of my psyche Mister Kimble

           and I'll stay out of yours.

          Kimble starts to chuckle. Then he stops suddenly. Lisa leans

          closer to the cell door and she hears Kimble sniffing. THUD!

          Lisa jumps back as Kimble kicks the cell door.

           KIMBLE (O.S)

           I know you're out there girlie. I

           can smell your pussy. How about you

           join me in here. Come on!

          Kimble bangs the door continuously. The racket echoes

          through the corridor. Sadie soon joins in, her and Kimble

          laugh maniacally as they thump on the doors. A horrified

          Lisa rushes towards the exit.

          large t-shirt. The morning sun bursts through the window,

          filling the room with an orange hue. Lisa shuts the curtains

          and slides under the duvet cover into the welcome sanctuary

          of her bed. Lisa drifts to sleep.

          Lisa is sleeping fast as night falls outside. All we can

          hear is the rhythm of her breathing and the gentle ticking

          of the clock by her bedside table.

          Suddenly her EYES snap open. We pull back and see that Lisa

          is now stood in front of LARGE WOODEN DOORS. The doors open

          and she steps inside.

          45.INT. CHURCH  NIGHT

          Lisa enters a Church full of powerful religious imagery. On

          the right side of the entrance she notices a Font. A drop of

          blood pierces the blessed water. As Lisa walks down the

          aisle we realise that everything has slowed to a crawl and

          she is moving in slow motion. White feathers cover the

          aisle, bouncing around her bare feet. An open Bible rests on

          the Lectern, the pages fluttering as if there is a strong

          breeze blowing them. Lisa looks up at a crucifix on the

           39.

          wall, the contorted face of a crucified Jesus Christ stares

          at her. Blood seeps from the crown of thorns and runs down

          Christ's face. As Lisa gets closer to the altar she sees a

          female figure sat in the front pew. Lisa ebbs closer. The

          figure turns. It's LISA'S MOTHER.

                          LISA'S MOTHER

           Don't you grieve for me?

                          LISA

           Of course I do.

          Suddenly tears of BLOOD run down Lisa's cheeks.

          Lisa's mother reaches out a hand. Lisa stretches her arm out

          to grab her mother's hand. Everything is in slow motion, it

          seems to take Lisa forever to reach her mother's hand.

          Suddenly a BLACK GLOVED HAND grabs her outstretched arm. She

          turns to see a HOODED FIGURE, face shrouded in darkness,

          standing next to her. A deep voice echoes around the church:

                          FIGURE

           Kill them. Kill them all.

           That's normal, it frightens me

           sometimes. But I've got to go up to

           a patient's room in Ward A.

           Apparently they've had a little

           accident. Surely you wouldn't

                          LISA

           Well... maybe not.

                          DELANEY

           I know Ward X is a scary place. But

           you'll get used to it.

                          LISA

           I can hear them talking. It's kinda

           unnerving.

                          DELANEY

           I know, I hear that too when I'm

           down there. But trust me, once you

           get used to it things will get

           easier.

          49.INT. WARD X  LATER

          The door creaks open. Lisa looks nervous. She walks in with

          her mop and bucket and heads to the end of the corridor. She

          begins mopping the floor. As she mops past Sadie's cell she

          hears a knock on the inside of the cell door.

                          SADIE

           I can hear you out there.

           41.

          Lisa is creeped out but she makes an effort to ignore it.

          She continues to mop the floor and starts moving past

          Sadie's cell.

                          SADIE

           I've been talking to your mother

           Lisa.

          Lisa stops dead in her tracks. She looks back at the cell

          door.

                          SADIE

           She's here with me Lisa. She's told

           me all about you.

          Lisa walks over to the cell door.

                          SADIE

           I know you're out there Lisa. Talk

           to me.

                          LISA

           What... what do you expect me to

           say?

                          SADIE

           Perhaps you can tell me all about

           the summer trips to Key West with

           your mother? Those were your

           favourite memories of your mother

           weren't they? Or perhaps you'd

           prefer to tell me about when you

           sat at your mother's bed side for

           six months, watching on helplessly

           as the cancer ravaged her body and

           sucked the life out of her?

          Lisa is horrified. She is shaking.

                          LISA

           How... how do you know all this?

                          SADIE

           Because your mother is speaking to

           me from the flames of hell!

                          LISA

           You sick fuck!

          Tears stream down Lisa's face.

                          SADIE

           She has a message for you Lisa.

           Want to hear it?

                          42

          Lisa wipes away the tears and tries to compose herself.

                          SADIE

           Want the message?

                          LISA

           What is it?

          There is a pause for a moment before an unnaturally deep

          inhuman voice emerges from Sadie's throat on the other side

          of the cell door:

                          SADIE

           GET OUT!!

          A distraught Lisa rushes towards the exit.

          50.INT. STAFF BATHROOM  CONTINUOUS

          Lisa rushes into the bathroom. A wave of emotion rises to

          the surface and she sobs into her hands. After a few moments

          the tears subside and she takes a deep inhalation of breath,

          desperately trying to compose herself. Lisa walks over to

          one of the sinks. She looks at her tear stained face in the

          mirror above it. Lisa turns the tap on and water rushes out.

          She leans down and splashes the water on her face.

          Lisa looks up and is STARTLED to see her face reflected in

          the mirror as an OLD HAG! Lisa clutches her decrepit face in

          horror! She closes her eyes and opens them again. Her

          reflection has returned to normal. Lisa hears Sadie's

          maniacal chuckle echo around the bathroom. She rushes out.

                         CUT TO:

          51.INT. HALLWAY  LATER

          A visibly upset Lisa rushes down the hallway towards

          Delaney.

                          DELANEY

           What's wrong Lisa?

                          LISA

           I'm not going down to Ward X again,

           I'm really sorry I just can't

           handle it down there!

           43.

                          DELANEY

           Okay, just calm down okay. Tell me

           what happened.

                          LISA

           They say things to me through the

           doors. Horrible things!

                          DELANEY

           I know, they've done it to me too.

                          LISA

           But that woman Sadie, she says

           things she couldn't possibly know

           about me.

                          DELANEY

           Like what?

          Lisa checks herself.

                          LISA

           I sound crazy don't I?

          Delaney smiles.

                          DELANEY

           No. This place just gets under your

           skin sometimes.

                          LISA

           I'm starting to wonder if I'm

           losing my mind.

                          DELANEY

           Well it's not healthy to think too

           much about what those crazy son-of-

           a-bitches say. Believe me you don't

           want them inside your head.

                          LISA

           It's hard to keep them out

           sometimes.

                          DELANEY

           Listen, take a break from Ward X

           for a while. I'll go down there for

           the next week or so.

                          LISA

           I'm really sorry about this, I

           didn't think it would effect me so

           much.

                          44

                          DELANEY

           Don't worry, it gets to everyone at

           first. But the last thing I want is

           for you to dread coming to work.

          Delaney puts his hand on Lisa's shoulder in a comforting

          manner.

                          LISA

           Thank you. I really appreciate

           that.

          Delaney smiles.

                          DELANEY

           No problem.

          53.INT. WARD X  HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL  NIGHT

          Continual thumping on one of the cell doors echoes around

          Ward X. Pemberton enters and walks over to Palmer' cell. He

          slides open the hatch.

                          PEMBERTON

           What's with all the fucking racket

           Palmer?

                          PALMER

           Sorry to bother you Mister

           Pemberton. But I wondered if it

           would be possible to get some

           medical attention?

          Palmer holds up his arm and it's been slashed open. Blood

          pours from the wound.

                          PEMBERTON

           Now how the hell did that happen?

          Palmer holds up a makeshift knife.

                          PALMER

           I believe it was this rather crude

           weapon that did the damage.

           45.

                          PEMBERTON

           Jesus Christ Palmer! Now put the

           weapon on the floor and back away.

          Palmer obliges with a smile on his face. Pemberton unhooks a

          truncheon from his waist belt.

                          PEMBERTON

           Put your hands on your fucking head

           and face the wall! Now!!

          Palmer willingly follows the instructions. Pemberton takes a

          set of keys from his belt and unlocks the cell.

                          PEMBERTON

           I'm coming in dipshit, one fucking

           move from you and I'll cave your

           fucking skull in! You understand??

                          PALMER

          Pemberton walks in with the truncheon raised above his head.

                          PEMBERTON

           Don't you fucking move!!

          A nervous Pemberton fumbles at his belt, trying to unhook a

          pair of handcuffs. Palmer slowly starts to back into him.

                          PEMBERTON

           I said don't fucking move!

          Palmer moves faster. Pemberton swings for him but Palmer

          ducks it and spins around, pushing Pemberton into the wall

          knocking him to the floor. Palmer aims a swift and savage

          stamp at Pemberton's head. His skull crushes against the

          cold hard floor. Blood spatters all over the white cell.

                          PALMER

           I'm terribly sorry about this.

          Palmer reaches down, takes Pemberton's keys and exits the

          cell.

          Palmer stands at the entrance to Kimble's cell. He selects

          the key marked with the corresponding cell number. Palmer

          puts it into the keyhole and opens the door.

                          PALMER

          Hardcastle looks down to the base of the staircase.

                          HARDCASTLE

           Pemberton? Pemberton, what's taking

           you so long man??

          No response. Hardcastle rushes down the steps.

                         CUT TO:

          58.INT. WARD X  CONTINUOUS

          Hardcastle enters. He sees the door of Palmer' cell open and

          slams a large red button on the wall next to the entrance.

          Hardcastle takes out his truncheon and cautiously approaches

          Palmer' cell. Looking inside he sees Pemberton crumpled on

          the floor in a pool of his own blood.

                          HARDCASTLE

           Shit!

          A SCREAM emerges from the next cell. Hardcastle rushes over

          to Kimble's cell door. Five orderlies rush onto the Ward.

                          HARDCASTLE

           We got a major code six over here!

          The orderlies rush to Hardcastle's side, truncheons at the

          ready. Hardcastle puts a key in the lock and prepares to

          open Kimble's cell.

           47.

                          HARDCASTLE

           Stay alert!

          Hardcastle turns the key and kicks open the door. They are

          met by the sight of KIMBLE's corpse positioned upright on

          the toilet. There is a hole in his head with part of his

          BRAIN seeping out. Palmer stands next to him, with blood on

          his lips and a plastic spoon in his hand. He smiles, blood

          covering his teeth.

                          PALMER

           Good evening gentleman. I believe

           we will be one short at roll call

           tomorrow morning.

          Hardcastle and the orderlies charge Palmer. He doesn't

          resist as they viscously tackle him to the ground.

          Lisa is walking down the hallway. She hears a SCREAM emerge

          from one of the rooms. She puts her ear to the door and

          hears the SCREAM again. Lisa kneels down and peers through

          the keyhole. In a clinical white room Palmer is strapped

          down on a table. His face is severely cut and bruised but he

          is conscious. Four orderlies hold his arms and legs while a

          fifth smears conductor on Palmer temples.

                          ORDERLY #1

           Do we need to put the bit in his

           mouth?

                          ORDERLY #2

           No. We're not giving him the

           methohexital either.

          The orderly places electrodes either side of Palmer' head.

          He then turns the dial on the ECT device up to full power.

          Palmer SCREAMS as he violently convulses, salivating heavily

          from his mouth. Suddenly the saliva turns to blood as he

          bites his own tongue off. Lisa is horrified as she watches

          the orderlies laugh as Palmer experiences a severe seizure.

          POV Shot: Someone is approaching Lisa as she crouches in

          front of the door. A hand reaches out and GRABS her by the

          hair,YANKING her to her feet. Lisa SCREAMS. She turns to see

          Hardcastle standing in front of her. He invades her personal

          space in an intimidating manner.

                          HARDCASTLE

           I just heard something so I ... I was

           just curious.

                          HARDCASTLE

           What are you seeing in there?

                          LISA

           Oh nothing, I didn't see anything.

                          HARDCASTLE

           You make sure it stays that way.

           That guy is a fucking menace and he

           deserves everything he gets. So you

           don't talk to Mixter or anyone else

           about anything you've seen in

           there. You understand?

                          LISA

           I won't say anything.

                          HARDCASTLE

           Good. Now don't you got some

           cleaning to do somewhere?

                          LISA

           Of course.

                          NANCY

           So what's wrong with the place?

                          50

                          LISA

          A lot of things. The way they run

          things for starters, the orderlies

          are complete bastards.

                          NANCY

          They usually are in those places.

                          LISA

          Some of the patients are extremely

          violent.

                          NANCY

          You haven't been hurt by anyone

          have you?

                          LISA

          No, nothing like that. Some of the

          things they say though... it's

          pretty frightening. The weirdest

          thing is... Oh I dunno, maybe it's

          just me. I wonder if I'm seeing

          things.

                          NANCY

          What do you mean?

                          LISA

          I think the place might be haunted.

          Either that or I'm losing my mind.

                          NANCY

          Well I wouldn't be surprised if it

          was haunted.

                          LISA

          What do you mean?

                          NANCY

          I told my father about your new

          job.

                          LISA

          Yeah?

                          NANCY

          Well, y'know they only built that

          Asylum a couple of years ago?

                          LISA

          Yeah.

          One Twelve Ocean Avenue.

                          LISA

          What's that?

                          NANCY

          You never heard of it?

                          LISA

          No.

                          NANCY

          It was a famous house. Or should I

          say infamous. Some guy shot his

          whole family there back in the

          seventies. Parents, brothers,

          sisters. Wiped out his entire

          family with a shotgun. Then the

          next owners of the house only

          lasted there about a month. They

          said they were driven from the

          house by evil spirits. The house

          became known around the world.

          That's why the recent owners sold

          the land, they had enough of all

          the media interest and constant

          tourists. Have you seriously never

          heard of the Amityville horror

          house?

                          LISA

          I vaguely remember hearing some

          stuff a while ago, but I never

          really took it in. I honestly

          didn't realise that the hospital

          was on the same land.

                          NANCY

          Yup, right on the spot where the

          house was demolished. You really

          think the place is haunted?

                          LISA

          Either that or I'm going crazy.

                          NANCY

          Well you're not crazy, hun. Perhaps

          the stories about hauntings at the

          house were true. Maybe the house is

          gone but the spirits stuck around.

                          52

           You believe in ghosts?

                          NANCY

           I dunno, never seen one. But I like

           to think I'm open minded. Plus

           you're the most intelligent girl I

           know. If you say you've seen

           something, I believe you.

          Lisa smiles.

                          LISA

           Thanks Nanc.

                          NANCY

           So what are you gonna do? Are you

           gonna quit?

                          LISA

           Part of me says I should. There's a

           lot about the place that frightens

           me. But I dunno... I think I've

           seen too much to be able to just

           walk away and forget the place.

                          NANCY

           If I was you I'd just walk away.

           Who wants to work at a place that

           frightens them?

                          LISA

           Well I need the money for starters.

           But now it feels like I need to

           find out more.

                          NANCY

           Maybe you are crazy after all!

          Lisa is sitting on her bed studying a laptop. On screen she

                         IS READING:

          "Ronald Joseph "Butch" DeFeo, Jr. is an American mass

          murderer. He was tried and convicted for the 1974 killings

          of his father, mother, two brothers and two sisters."

           hundred bucks on Mark and I gotta

           come beg you for money all the time

           What's the matter with you, boy?

           Your brother's broken his leg, he

           needs that wheelchair.

                          BUTCH

           Well I need money too!

                          RONALD SENIOR

           Butch, you get a wage from the auto

           dealership every Friday and it's

           gone by Monday. Why is that?

                          BUTCH

           get everything you want for nothing

          Ronald Senior stands there, axe in hand, eye-balling his

          son.

                          BUTCH

           This ain't over.

          Butch storms back towards the house. Ronald Senior brings

          the axe forcefully down on a piece of wood, splitting it

          cleanly in half.

          There is a knock on the door. A pale looking man in his

          way holding a brown paper bag.

          Butch uses a lighter to boil a spoon full of heroin. On his

          right arm is a belt. He then loads the heroin into a

          syringe. Butch tightens the belt and taps his arm. He sinks

          the needle into a prominent vein and plunges the heroin into

          his blood stream. His eyes sink and he lies back onto the

          crusty carpet of the apartment, staring up at the ceiling.

          From a bird's eye view we slowly move down towards Butch.

          Suddenly a chorus of voices chatter around his ears.

           VOICE #1 (O.S)

           It's kill or be killed.

           VOICE #2 (O.S)

          Butch puts his jacket on and prepares to open the front

          door. Suddenly a large hand GRABS the back of his jacket.

          Butch swipes the hand away and spins around to see his

          father red with rage.

           god-damn it!

          Ronald Senior grabs Butch by the scruff of the neck and

          SLAMS him against the door. LOUISE DEFEO rushes in.

           What the hell's going on??

                          RONALD SENIOR

           Our son's a fuckin' junkie thief,

           that's what's going on!! He robbed

           the fucking dealership!!

                          BUTCH

           Don't listen to him Ma, I ain't

          Ronald Senior and Butch fall to the floor and start

          grappling.

                          LOUISE

           Stop it!! Stop it now!!

          Louise attempts to pull Ronald Senior off Butch. Her nails

          dig into her husband's neck and draw blood. An enraged

          Ronald Senior grabs his wife's arms as she starts to slap

          him. Butch scrambles to his feet and rushes down the

          hallway. Ronald Senior remonstrates with Louise who is still

          trying to slap him.

           57.

          Suddenly Ronald Senior feels cold metal pressed against the

          back of his head. Louise SCREAMS and steps back. Ronald

          Senior freezes. Ronald Senior slowly turns to see Butch, his

          eyes bloodshot and his face emotionless, aiming a MARLIN

          RIFLE at his head.

                          BUTCH

           I've had enough of you fat man!!

           Ronnie, don't!! Please!!

          Ronald Senior's trembles with fear as he stares into his

          son's cold eyes. Butch places his finger on the trigger.

                          LOUISE

           No!!

          Butch pulls the trigger. Louise SCREAMS. The gun JAMS.

          Ronald Senior breathes a sigh of relief. Butch lowers the

          gun and storms off towards the basement. Louise embraces

          Ronald Senior, who appears to be in shock.

           RONALD SENIOR (O.S)

           I want him out of this house

           tomorrow. He's gone.

           LOUISE (O.S)

          Well I don't know that it was

          haunted. Lots of people think

          that's lies. I know about the kid

                          DELANEY

          Really? It's a famous case.

                          LISA

          How come you never mentioned it?

                          DELANEY

          You seem spooked already. I didn't

          want to make it worse.

                          LISA

          Y'know why I'm spooked?

                          DELANEY

          Because of the patients on Ward X.

                          LISA

          It's not just that Delaney. I think

          this place is haunted. In fact, I'm

          sure of it.

                          60

                          DELANEY

          You've seen something?

                          LISA

          Remember I said I saw a little girl

          roaming the hallways here? I know

          who she is. She's one of the DeFeo

          children who were killed. You ever

          seen her?

                          DELANEY

          No.

                          LISA

          Honestly?

                          DELANEY

          To be honest I don't believe in all

          that ghost stuff.

                          LISA

          Well I wasn't a huge believer, but

          I know what I've seen.

                          DELANEY

          I believe that you've seen

          something. Some people are more

          open to that kind of thing, y'know?

          But me? I'm closed off to that

          extra terrestrial stuff.

                          LISA

          Extra terrestrial is aliens.

                          DELANEY

          Whatever it's called, I don't know.

                          LISA

          So what do you believe in? Do you

          believe in God?

                          DELANEY

          Serious questions tonight.

                          LISA

          I'm just curious.

                          DELANEY

          Why do you ask?

                          LISA

          It's something I've been thinking

          about. How can evil exist in a

           61.

           world that many people believe was

           created by a loving God?

                          DELANEY

           I don't believe that God is a

           bearded man who lives in the sky.

           Or that the Devil is a red demon

           with horns. I believe God and Satan

           are within all of us. God is our

           human side. Satan is our animal

           side. Whether we become good or

           evil depends which side of us we

           feed.

                          LISA

           It's a frightening thing to believe

           that if God exists he is not

           powerful enough to stop evil.

                          DELANEY

           Free will in the hands of a person

           who feeds the Evil inside them.

           That's what frightens me.

          Lisa ponders for a moment.

                          LISA

           Doctor Mixter must have known what

           stood on this land before the

           hospital.

                          DELANEY

           Of course he did. He bought the

           land and organised the demolition

           of the house himself.

                          LISA

           Why would he build on this land

           knowing the history of the place?

                          DELANEY

           He's not superstitious. He's a

           doctor, they don't usually believe

           in those things. Amityville is full

           of local legends, going back even

           before the DeFeos.

                          LISA

           Like what?

                          DELANEY

           There's stories about the Native

           Americans being slaughtered on this

           land many years ago. Some people

                          62

           even believed the Indian Chief

           possessed that kid who killed his

           family.

                          LISA

           Really?

                          DELANEY

           I don't think that's true. If I've

           learnt anything from the patients

           on Ward X, it's that some people

           have a mind that works in a

           different way to other people.

           Those people who do bad things have

           fed the evil within them more than

           the good. It's not possession, it's

           sickness. Sickness of the soul.

                          LISA

           I don't know what to think.

                          DELANEY

           Just don't let your imagination run

           away with you Lisa. You're a person

           who feeds that good within you.

           Don't let this place feed the evil.

          Lisa enters the Library. She approaches a stuffy looking

          middle aged woman with glasses perched on the end of her

          nose.

                          LISA

           Hi, sorry to bother you but my

           name's Lisa Templeton. I rang

           yesterday to set up a meeting with

           No problem, nice to meet you! I've

           set up a table in the back. I've

           63.

           got a few books that may help you

           with your inquiries.

                          LISA

           Thank you, that's great.

                         CUT TO:

          71.INT. LIBRARY  LATER

          Lisa and Gloria are sat at a table in a secluded corner of

          the Library. Various books are spread out on the table.

                          GLORIA

           So you wanted to know about the

           history of Amityville dating back

           to the Native Americans?

                          LISA

           Yes that's right. I'm writing a

           college paper and I had heard some

           rumours in the neighbourhood about

           Native Americans being killed on

           the land down on Oceans Avenue.

          Gloria's demeanour instantly turns from jovial to serious.

                          GLORIA

           Well that area has quite a dark

           history.

                          LISA

           You mean the DeFeo murders at One

           Twelve?

                          GLORIA

           Yes. Terrible business that. Those

           young children. Breaks my heart to

           think about such a tragedy.

                          LISA

           Yeah it's awful.

                          GLORIA

           You know most of the town was very

           upset when they decided to build

           that mental institution on the

           land. That used to be a nice

           suburban neighbourhood, now there's

           this big eye sore there. We had a

                          64

           thousand names on a petition. But I

           guess that Doctor who runs the

           place has enough money to pay off

           the people in high places.

                          LISA

           So what about the native Americans?

           Is that story about them being

           killed on that land true?

                          GLORIA

           There's something on that here.

          Gloria flips through one of the books.

                          GLORIA

           Ah yes, here it is. (Reading) In

           the 18th Century there existed a

           group of Native Americans in

           Amityville known as "The Satchem

           Tribe" led by Satchem Takapausha,

           the Chief. The tribe had fled Salem

           in Massachusetts to escape

           persecution by the Christians who

           were persecuting members of the

           tribe because of their Witchcraft

           practices. These practices included

           a ritualistic human sacrifice of

           six people (The significance of Six

           being related to the biblical

           number of man and creation) in

           order to induce the spirit of their

           God, The Dark Master, who they

           believed manifested his powers

           through his devoted followers,

           giving them immortality. The

           hundred strong tribe settled in

           Amityville but were later chased

           off the land by local Christians.

           Satchem accused the Christians of

           not properly compensating his tribe

           for the land. A war started and the

           Christians hired a hunter called

           John Underhill from Salem. At the

           site where One Twelve Oceans Avenue

           was later built in Amityville,

           Underhill killed all of the tribe.

           The Indians were buried in a mass

           grave on the site. Before he died

           Satchem vowed revenge. According to

           local legend, Chief Satchem is

           believed to have subsequently

           haunted the land. Various

           parapsychologists and mediums have

           65.

           claimed that Satchem's vengeful

           spirit influenced the 1974 DeFeo

           murders at One Twelve Oceans Avenue

           and the haunting of the subsequent

           owners. Although such assertions

           are widely disputed.

                          LISA

           So the legend has basis in

           historical fact?

                          GLORIA

           Absolutely.

                          LISA

           You told me the other night that

           you think evil is within us all.

           But do you think that people can be

           influenced by an evil that comes

           from outside of themselves?

                          DELANEY

           Are you still thinking about this?

                          LISA

           I guess I am yeah.

                          DELANEY

           I worry that you're thinking too

           much. This place is getting to you.

                          LISA

           There's something going on in this

           place. Something sinister. And I

           don't just mean the patients on

           Ward X. Have you not noticed that?

                          DELANEY

           I've noticed some things.

                          LISA

           Why haven't you said anything? Or

           done anything?

          Delaney contemplates for a moment.

           It's like the honey bee.

                          LISA

           What do you mean?

                          DELANEY

           The honey bee is fine when it's

           just flying from flower to flower.

           Then they think that a person is a

           threat and they sting them. They

           might leave a sting but the person

           will recover. The bee dies. So I

           ask myself... is it worth it?

          Delaney returns his attention to the cup of coffee in his

          hands as Lisa disappears into her own thoughts.

          73.INT. LIVING ROOM  LISA'S HOME  DAY

          Lisa is sat in an armchair with a laptop resting on her

          thighs. On screen she is reading a Wikipedia entry:

          "The Satchem Tribe was a tribe of Native American origin

          that existed in the 18th Century. They fled Massachusetts and

          settled in Amityville where they were ultimately murdered

          over a land dispute. The Tribe was renowned for practices in

          line with Witchcraft and worshipped a God called The Dark

          Master. In 2009, it emerged that a modern cult incarnation

          of the tribe existed. They have adopted the traditional

          beliefs of the Satchem tribe but the modern followers are

          not required to be of Native American origin."

          Lisa scrolls down to the References section. She clicks on a

          link. A Blog appears on screen entitled The Dark Master: An

          Ancient Vision for A Modern World. She reads the latest Blog

                         POST:

          "Our time is at hand. On November 13th 2013, 6 souls will be

          her computer. November 13th is the day after tomorrow. Lisa

          refers back to the blog and notices the author of the last

          blog post: "SisterSadie".

           67.

          Lisa's mind is racing. Lisa types 'Sadie Krenwinkel' into a

          Search Engine. The first result is a Wikipedia entry. Lisa

          clicks on it. She reads:

          "Sadie Krenwinkel is a convicted murderer and former member

          of The Satchem Cult, a modern incarnation of a Native

          American tribe who practiced Witchcraft in the 18th Century.

          In 2009, Krenwinkel led ten members of the cult to 1005

          Dennison Drive where they subsequently tortured and murdered

          five individuals. One potential victim managed to escape and

          lead police to Krenwinkel. At her trial in 2010, Krenwinkel

          outlined the beliefs of the Satchem Cult, claiming the human

          sacrifice of six individuals would have given them

          immortality. As a result her lawyer submitted a plea of

          insanity and Krenwinkel was subsequently sentenced to

          indefinite incarceration in a mental institution."

          of the Doctor who testified to her insanity at her trial:

          Lisa slides open the hatch and looks inside. The cell is

          covered in lit candles with Sadie sat cross legged in the

          centre of the room.

                          LISA

                          SADIE

           Our time is at hand!

          Lisa slides the hatch shut. She walks over to the last door

          on the left. Lisa slides the hatch open and peers in. The

          resident John Doe sits in the shadows. Suddenly he sits

          forward and a bright shaft of daylight illuminates his face.

          Lisa is shocked to see a face she recognises from the

          internet article staring at her. The face of RONALD "BUTCH"

          DEFEO JUNIOUR. Lisa slams the hatch shut and backs down the

          hallway, her mind racing as fast as her pulse rate.

                         CUT TO:

          76.INT. HALLWAY  LATER

          Lisa knocks on the door to Doctor's Mixter's office.

           MIXTER (O.S)

           Come in.

          Lisa pops her head inside.

                          LISA

           Doctor Mixter.

                          MIXTER

           Oh Lisa, Hello. What brings you

           here?

           69.

                          LISA

           I just wondered if I could speak to

           you for a moment sir. It's very

           important.

                          MIXTER

           Of course, come in.

                         CUT TO:

          77.INT. MIXTER'S OFFICE  CONTINUOUS

          Lisa enters and sits down opposite Mixter, who is sat behind

          his desk filling out a form.

                          MIXTER

           What can I do for you Lisa?

                          LISA

           Well... what I'm going to tell you

           will sound really strange but I

           need to tell you.

                          MIXTER

           Okay, go ahead.

                          LISA

           Do you know the history of the land

           the hospital is built on?

                          MIXTER

           What are you referring to exactly?

                          LISA

           Well, first of all. The DeFeo

           murders and the infamous house that

           people said was haunted.

                          MIXTER

           I am aware of the DeFeo murders

           yes. The hauntings... well I think

           it's common perception now that a

           lot of that was exaggerated by the

           media.

                          LISA

           Maybe. Are you aware of the history

           of the land dating back to the

           eighteenth century?

                          MIXTER

           No, I can't say that I am.

                          70

                          LISA

           There were a group of Native

           Americans in Amityville known as

           "The Satchem Tribe". They were

           massacred by Christians after a

           dispute over the land.

                          MIXTER

           Okay. I'm sure there's a point to

           all this?

                          LISA

           Yes. Sadie Krenwinkel down on Ward

           X. She shares the beliefs of the

           Satchem Tribe. I have reason to

           believe that somehow she has access

           to the internet and Witchcraft

           paraphernalia and she's planning on

           a human sacrifice tonight to try

           and raise the God she believes in,

           The Dark Master, and become

           immortal.

          Mixter chuckles.

                          LISA

           I'm serious.

                          MIXTER

           Have you been reading up on Sadie?

           It's rather outlandish stuff isn't

           it? But I can assure you she has no

           access to the internet or anything

           else.

                          LISA

           Go on the internet and check out

           the Blog! She signs herself Sister

           Sadie.

                          MIXTER

           Well that could be anyone called

           Sadie couldn't it?

                          LISA

           Go down and search her cell!

                          MIXTER

           I don't believe that will be

           necessary. The patients on Ward X

           spend twenty three hours a day in

           the cell. They get an hour of

           exercise in a small yard guarded by

           six of our staff. There's no way

           71.

          that any of those patients have

          access to the internet or any

          paraphernalia.

                          LISA

          Then someone is helping her get

          access to this stuff! Someone who

          works here! Please Doctor Mixter.

          Just check out her cell and speak

          to her. If I'm wrong about this and

          it's all just her delusions then

          fine. I'll accept that. But I had

          to tell you. You testified at her

          trial didn't you?

                          MIXTER

          Yes I did. What are you implying?

                          LISA

          Nothing. I just meant you know how

          dangerous she is.

                          MIXTER

          Yes, I understand how dangerous she

          is and I appreciate you coming to

          express your concerns. One thing

          you need to bear in mind Lisa is

          that there are some very sick

          patients at this institution. We do

          our best to help those who can be

          helped but unfortunately the

          patients on Ward X are beyond help.

          Their personality disorders are too

          advanced, their delusions are too

          grandiose. I worry that perhaps you

          have been rather taken in by one of

          those delusions.

                          LISA

          I know that it might sound like

          that. But can you check her cell

          and speak to her? Look at the blog

          on the internet, see if you can

          connect the IP number of the writer

          with a computer here at the

          hospital.

                          MIXTER

          Okay look. That does take time and

          resources I don't necessarily have.

          But as you've come to me with a

          concern of patient infraction and

          potential threat of violence, I am

          duty bound to investigate.

                          72

                          LISA

           Thank you.

                          MIXTER

           In fact, I'll order a cell search

           immediately. Stay here for a

           moment, I'll be right back.

          Mixter exits. Lisa leans forward and a file on the desk

          catches her eye. She stands up and reaches over for it. Her

          NAME is on it. Lisa opens it up. Inside is a form Committing

          her to the hospital as a PATIENT. Lisa looks down and the

          reason stated is PARANOID DELUSION. The date on the form is

          November 13th. Today. Lisa slams the file shut and the office

          door opens. She turns to see Mixter stood there with

          Hardcastle and another orderly.

                          LISA

           What the hell are you doing??

                          MIXTER

           This is for your own good Lisa. You

           need treatment.

          The orderlies approach her. Lisa lashes out but the two men

          overpower her, grabbing her arms and then tripping her. She

          hits the floor with a thud. Mixter produces a syringe from

          behind his back.

                          MIXTER

           This is for your own good Lisa.

                          LISA

           Fuck you!!!

          Mixter plunges the needle into her neck. POV SHOT: Lisa

          looks up at Mixter and the orderlies and we FADE TO BLACK.

                         FADE IN:

          78.INT. CELL  NIGHT

          Lisa awakens, sat in the corner of a cold white cell. She

          tries to get up before realising she's strapped into a

          straight jacket. Lisa SCREAMS. The hatch opens and Mixter

          peers in. The hatch then closes and the door opens. Mixter

          enters.

                          LISA

           Let me out of here you sick fuck!!

           73.

                          MIXTER

           Now Lisa, let's talk calmly or you

           will be sedated again.

          Mixter walks over and sits on the edge of the bed.

                          LISA

           Why are you doing this?

                          MIXTER

           You're having paranoid delusions.

           I'm also aware that you've been

           having disturbing visions.

                          LISA

           I'm not having delusions, I know

           what I've seen!

                          MIXTER

           Well you think you know. The human

           brain is a powerful thing and I'm

           sure you do believe what you've

           seen. But it's all in your mind

           Lisa, it's not reality. You're a

           very sick girl and you need

           treatment.

                          LISA

           You do this to all your staff huh?

           The minute we speak out we get

           fucking committed??

                          MIXTER

           Staff? You were never staff here

           Lisa. You're a patient here. You've

           always been a patient here.

          Lisa appears confused.

                          LISA

           No, no. You're lying to me, I know

           who I am! I KNOW WHO I AM!!

                          MIXTER

           I'm afraid not my dear. You've

           always been with us here. Initially

           as an out patient but now the

           delusions have progressed I feel

           it's time for you to become a full

           time resident.

                          74

          Lisa becomes upset. Tears stream down her face.

                          LISA

           But... but...

                          MIXTER

           Look, I understand it's a lot to

           process now. I'll leave you to

           think about it and then we'll begin

           counselling sessions tomorrow.

                          LISA

           Okay.

          Lisa sobs.

                          MIXTER

           Listen, how about I take this

           straight jacket off so you're more

           comfortable?

                          LISA

           Thank you.

                          MIXTER

           First you must take this. It will

           help you sleep.

          Mixter hands Lisa a red pill and a bottle of water. She

          takes the pill and pops it in her mouth before taking a gulp

          of water.

                          MIXTER

           Good girl. I know it's a lot to

           take in but together we'll get

           through this. Now I'm going to take

           your restraint off. Remember

           though, if you're violent then I

           promise you it will go straight

           back on. Okay?

                          LISA

           Okay.

          Mixter unties the straight jacket at the back and lifts it

          off.

                          MIXTER

           That better?

                          LISA

           Yes. Thank you.

           75.

                          MIXTER

           No problem. I'm going to leave you

           get some rest now. Tomorrow we

           start the healing process.

          Mixter exits. The echo of the steel door closing

          reverberates around the tiny cell. We hear Mixter's

          footsteps as he walks down the hallway. Lisa's upset

          demeanour disappears immediately. She spits the red pill

          into the palm of her hand.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          79.EXT. HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL  LATER THAT NIGHT

          A storm is brewing in the dark sky above High Hopes

          Hospital.

                         CUT TO:

          80.INT. SADIE'S CELL  WARD X - NIGHT

          Sadie is sat cross legged in the centre of her cell

          surrounded by candles.

                          SADIE

           Adoni, Helumnay, Peenay,

           Adoni, Helumnay, Peenay,

           The gods do command thee

           from thy majesty

           oh mapulamun.

                         CUT TO:

          81.INT. MIXTER'S OFFICE  CONTINUOUS

          Mixter is in his office putting on a large hooded black

          robe.

           SADIE (V.O)

           Adoni, Helumnay, Peenay,

           come forward blessed one,

           know your calling

           come forward oh blessed one.

                          76

          Mixter opens the cupboard and takes out a .35 caliber lever

          action Marlin 336C RIFLE. The CLOCK on the wall reads

          3:15am.

                         CUT TO:

          82.INT. PATIENT X'S CELL  WARD X  CONTINUOUS

          Patient X is asleep in the corner.

           SADIE (V.O)

           Accept our humble gratitude

           for your offering, in death you

           give life, may you find wings to

           the kingdom. The Dark Master,

           keeper of the gate, master of all

           fate, hear us!

          The lock of the door turns. Patient X's eyes snap open. The

          door opens. Mixter is stood in the doorway, dressed in a

          hooded black robe. He holds the Marlin rifle in his hands.

          He approaches Patient X and holds out the rifle and a box of

          shells. Patient X takes them. Mixter walks out.

                         CUT TO:

          83.INT. WARD X  CONTINUOUS

          Mixter walks down the hallway and reaches for a series of

          buttons on the wall. He punches in a combination of numbers

          and all of the doors unlock. Patient X is stood in the

          doorway of his cell, rifle at his side. Sadie rushes out of

          her cell and sees him. A broad smile spreads on her face.

          She turns to Mixter.

                          SADIE

           We did it Elliot, we did it! Our

           time is at hand!! Immortality is

           ours!

          Patient X raises the rifle and squeezes the trigger. The

          BLAST rips through the back of Sadie's head, blowing half of

          her face away. She is killed instantly and her lifeless

          corpse drops to the floor. Mixter smiles and leaves the

          Ward.

           77.

          84.INT. CELL  SAME TIME

          Lisa has her ear pressed to the door. She can hear GUN SHOTS

          and SCREAMING. She starts to panic and rushes over to the

          small window. She slams her hand into the window but the

          glass doesn't break. The lock on the door snaps. Lisa slides

          down the wall, terrified. The door opens and DELANEY walks

          in. Lisa breathes a huge sigh of relief and rushes over,

          throwing her arms around him.

                          DELANEY

           We need to get out of here! One of

           the patients is running around with

           a shot gun down on Ward X!

                         CUT TO:

          85.INT. WARD X  CONTINUOUS

          Patient X kicks open the door to Palmer cell. The

          lobotomised Palmer is lying face down on his bed. Patient X

          aims the gun and a SHOT tears through Palmer' back.

          Hardcastle and another orderly rush onto the Ward. Patient X

          takes aim and shoots Hardcastle in the chest, killing him

          instantly. The other orderly turns to run and is SHOT in the

          leg.

                         CUT TO:

          86.INT. WARD B  SAME TIME

          Delaney and Lisa run through the Ward. They turn a corner

          and are suddenly confronted by a large group of patients in

          white gowns.

                          LISA

           Fuck!!

          Delaney and Lisa run back the other way and turn the corner.

          Two orderlies, brandishing truncheons, are approaching.

                          LISA

           Please help us!

                          DELANEY

           The patients are loose!

                          ORDERLY #1

           We'll take care of them.

                          78

          The orderlies turn the corner and see the large group. The

          orderlies look at each other, fear in their eyes. They turn

          to run but the patients overpower them in a flash, grabbing

          and scratching, deep wounds tearing into their skin. Delaney

          and Lisa look on as the helpless orderlies SCREAM.

                          LISA

           Shouldn't we help them??

                          DELANEY

           We need to save ourselves. Let them

           reap what they've sewn.

          Delaney grabs Lisa and they run down the hallway, as the

          patients beat the orderlies with their own truncheons.

                         CUT TO:

          87.INT. HALLWAY  CONTINUOUS

          Lisa and Delaney rush down the hallway. They turn a corner

          and are stopped in their tracks by the GHOST of ALLISON

          DEFEO stood in the centre of the hallway clutching a teddy

          bear. She has a HUGE bullet hole in the centre of her

          forehead, blood dripping down her face.

                          ALLISON

           Why don't you want to play with me?

          CRASH! A door at the other end of the hallway is kicked

          open. Patient X bursts through and aims the rifle. Lisa and

          Delaney rush back down the hallway. A BULLET HITS the wall

          just as they turn into an open doorway.

                         CUT TO:

          88.INT. HALLWAY  CONTINUOUS

          Lisa and Delaney are running through the hallway. They burst

          through a door.

                         CUT TO:

          89.INT. SHOWER ROOM  CONTINUOUS

          Lisa and Delaney find themselves in the shower room. Mould

          covers the walls and all of the showers are on, gushing

          dirty water. They spot another door on the other side of the

           79.

          shower room but blocking their path to it is a thin middle

          aged man in a white vest and white shorts, facing the wall.

          He is whispering to himself. Lisa and Delaney stop.

                          LISA

           Hey mister, you need to get the

           hell out of here, there's a patient

           going crazy with a gun!!

          The man turns around. His face is weathered and his eyes are

          wild and bloodshot.

                          MAN

           My...my skin's on too tight!

                          DELANEY

           What?

                          MAN

           My skin is on too tight!

          Delaney grabs Lisa and they start ebbing past the man

          towards the door. The man is getting increasingly more

          agitated, scratching at his face.

                          MAN

           My skin's on too tight!!

          The man reaches into the pocket of his shorts and produces a

          scalpel.

                          MAN

           My skin is on too tight!!

          The man STABS his cheek with the scalpel. Lisa SCREAMS! The

          man drags the scalpel around his face in one continuous

          motion, blood seeping from the circular gash. As Lisa and

          Delaney watch on in horror the man RIPS the skin off his

          face, exposing muscles and veins. His white vest and shorts

          are now saturated with blood. The man sighs with relief.

                          MAN

           That's much better.

          A horrified Lisa and Delaney rush towards the door and BURST

          through it.

                         CUT TO:

          90.INT. HALLWAY  CONTINUOUS

                          80

          Delaney and Lisa sprint down the hallway as GUNSHOTS ring

          out in the distance.

                         CUT TO:

          91.INT. RECEPTION AREA- CONTINUOUS

          Delaney and Lisa rush towards the main doors. They're

          locked. Delaney fumbles for a set of keys.

                          LISA

           Come on, hurry, please!!

          Delaney finds the right key. He checks the lock and realises

          that a key has been snapped off in it.

                          DELANEY

           Kurwa!!

                          LISA

           What, what??

                          DELANEY

           A fucking key's been snapped in the

           lock!

          Delaney rushes to the reception desk and grabs a chair. He

          rushes over to a window next to the door and raises the

          chair. BANG! A bullet tears through his back and exits

          through his chest with an explosion of blood. Lisa SCREAMS!

          Delaney drops to his knees and Lisa rushes to his side.

          Patient X loads fresh cartridges in the rifle. Delaney is

          DEAD. Lisa runs down the hallway. Patient X takes aim. Just

          as Lisa bursts through a door, a bullet blasts apart one

          side of the frame.

                         CUT TO:

          92.INT. WARD B  CONTINUOUS

          Lisa runs through Ward B.

          LISA'S POV  Patient X bursts through the door and pursues

          her. Lisa keeps running as Patient X aims the gun.

          Lisa looks back just as he fires and the BULLET narrowly

          misses her, the force sending her crashing into a stack of

          chairs. Her leg catches on the chairs and she falls to the

          ground. Lisa crawls towards a door. Hauling herself up she

          manages to turn the handle and the door swings open.

           81.

          LISA'S POV  Patient X stands just yards away, attempting to

          get a steady clean shot at Lisa. He squeezes off the trigger

          just as she falls through the door, the SHOT blowing the

          door apart.

                         CUT TO:

          93.INT. HALLWAY  CONTINUOUS

          Lisa limps down the hallway. She tries the handles of a door

          but it's locked. She tries another-also locked. Lisa

          finally finds a door that is open and she rushes through.

                         CUT TO:

          94.INT.STAFF ROOM  CONTINUOUS

          Lisa enters a small staff room. She SLAMS the door behind

          her. She clicks the lock. Lisa steps back from the door. She

          JUMPS as Patient X POUNDS on the door from the other side.

          Lisa looks around for a weapon. She limps toward the cutlery

          drawer below a sink. She rustles inside and finds a large

          butcher knife. Suddenly the door EXPLODES, a large hole

          blown through the middle of it by the GUN SHOT. Patient X

          reaches through, groping for the lock. Lisa reaches a large

          window in the room. She tries to lift the window. After an

          unsuccessful attempt at opening it she realises the window

          is nailed down.

                          LISA

           Fuck!!

          Patient X reaches for the lock. Lisa dashes to the storage

          cupboard and ducks inside.

                         CUT TO:

          95.INT. STORAGE CUPBOARD  CONTINUOUS

          Lisa pulls the door shut and falls to the floor of the dark

          interior. Lisa faces the door, bracing herself with the

          knife held upwards. Everything is quiet. Suddenly the door

          SHAKES as Patient X THUMPS on it. The door cracks as Patient

          X SMASHES against it. Lisa crouches down with the knife at

          the ready.

                          82

          The gun BLOWS a HOLE right through the door. Patient X leans

          through the hole, peering down at Lisa crouched on the

          floor. He aims the gun through the hole and prepares to

          fire. Lisa brandishes the knife and thrusts it forward with

          all her might. The blade RIPS through Patient X's right eye.

          He SCREAMS and drops the gun in the cupboard before

          stumbling backwards into the staff room. Patient X clasps

          his hands to his eye which is now gushing with blood. Lisa

          grabs the gun and stands up. Patient X looks at her with his

          remaining eye. Lisa aims the rifle through the hole in the

          door.

                          LISA

           Lights out, you son-of-a-bitch!!

          BANG! The shot gun BLASTS a hole through Patient X's chest,

          blood splatters over Lisa. Suddenly a WHITE LIGHT fills the

          room and ALLISON DEFEO materialises. She is dressed in a

          clean white dress, her angelic complexion bears no wounds.

          Allison takes the hand of PATIENT X's corpse. The WHITE

          LIGHT swarms over Patient X's body and he rises to his feet.

          His head is now intact and he is dressed in a white robe. He

          looks at Allison and they share a peaceful smile. Allison

          walks with Patient X through a doorway filled with a

          blinding WHITE LIGHT. They disappear and the light slowly

          dissipates.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          96.INT. HALLWAY  HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL - LATER

          Lisa, covered in blood, walks through the hallway with the

          rifle by her side. She reaches the door to Doctor Mixter's

          office and kicks it open. Mixter is sat behind his desk, now

          dressed in his usual shirt and tie. Lisa aims the gun at

          Mixter whose hands are beneath the table.

                          LISA

           Get your fucking hands up you sick

           fuck!

          INSERT SHOT: Mixter presses a red button beneath the desk.

          Mixter raises his hands.

                          MIXTER

           I see we've dispensed with the

           usual pleasantries. Come in Lisa.

          Lisa enters, kicking the door shut behind her.

           83.

                         CUT TO:

          97.INT. MIXTER'S OFFICE  CONTINUOUS

          Mixter is very calm. Lisa is trembling, the rifle visibly

          shaking in her hands as she aims it at Mixter's head.

                          LISA

           You gonna tell me it's all in my

           head now huh?? Wanna tell me I'm

           the crazy one??

                          MIXTER

           Well maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

           How would you know?

                          LISA

           Get the fuck out of my head you

           son-of-a-bitch! I know who I am and

           I know what I've seen! You're part

           of all of this. I know you are!

           You're the crazy one!!

                          MIXTER

           You're the one holding the gun on a

           well respected doctor, my dear.

                          LISA

           Why did you do this? Why??

                          MIXTER

           You are part of a great becoming

           tonight. A rising of The Dark

           Master who blesses all of his

           followers with power and

           immortality.

                          LISA

           You fucking believe that do you??

           Sounds like a bunch of bullshit to

           me! You're no better than those

           fucking fundamentalists who kill

           innocent people because they've

           twisted shit they've read in some

           Holy book. It's all shit!!

                          MIXTER

           The plan for the becoming is almost

           complete. Just one more sacrifice,

           that's all we need tonight.

                          84

                          LISA

           How about if I blow your fucking

           head off then huh??

          Suddenly SIRENS can be heard outside. The screeching of car

          wheels. Mixter smiles. Lisa, still holding the gun at

          Mixter, shuffles over to the window and peers through the

          blinds. The car park is full of police cars. A dozen armed

          police officers rush towards the building. Lisa looks back

          to see Mixter chuckling.

                          LISA

           What the fuck are you laughing at?

                          MIXTER

           It's all falling into place.

                          LISA

           The cops coming here? I'm gonna

           tell them everything about you and

           your little sick plan! They're

           gonna lock you up and throw away

           the key!!

                          MIXTER

           If you say so.

          Outside they hear the police rushing down the hallway.

                          MIXTER

           Tell me something Lisa, would it

           help your grief over your mother if

           you knew she was a slut?

                          LISA

           What did you say??

                          MIXTER

           Yes. That's why she's burning in

           hell.

          Lisa, her teeth clenched, moves forward and places the

          business end of the rifle against Mixter's temple.

                          LISA

           You shut the fuck about my mother,

           you don't know anything!!

                          MIXTER

           I know that sometimes you wonder

           why you don't cry enough for her. I

           know you feel guilty for not doing

           more for her when she was alive.

           You feel guilty for moving on with

           85.

           your life and forgetting about

           her!!

                          LISA

           I have not forgotten about her!!

                          MIXTER

           Face it Lisa, you never cared for

           her. You never cared for anyone but

           yourself. She's looking up from the

           bowels of hell now knowing that you

           never loved her!

          Tears stream down Lisa's face. She's crumbling.

                          LISA

           SHUT UP!! SHUT UP!!

                          MIXTER

           She was a whore!

          Lisa HITS Mixter over the head with the butt of the rifle.

          He falls to the ground and looks up at a crazed Lisa.

                          MIXTER

           Your mother's in hell and you don't

           care!!

                          LISA

           Fuck you!!

          Lisa aims the rifle at Mixter's face. Suddenly the police

          burst in. Lisa spins around, the rifle still in her hands.

          POLICE OPEN FIRE! Her body is riddled with BULLETS and she

          falls to the floor in a blood soaked heap.

          A glamorous woman addresses the camera.

                          PRESENTER

           And we're back with our next guest.

           A year ago he was a survivor of the

           High Hopes Hospital mass murder

           when cleaner Lisa Templeton ran

           amok with a rifle, claiming six

           victims and injuring many others.

           Doctor Elliot Mixter has written a

           new book entitled 'Shattered Hopes'

           which provides an account of that

           fateful night as well as some

           background into the mind of the

           murderer. Doctor Mixter, good

           morning.

          Mixter is sat opposite, in a very expensive suit.

                          MIXTER

           Morning Katherine, how are you?

                          PRESENTER

           I'm good thank you. So Doctor, can

           you tell us a little more about the

           book?

                          MIXTER

           Well, it features a blow by blow

           account of the evening. It was

           obviously a very harrowing

           experience and for me it was rather

           therapeutic to deal with my

           feelings about what happened in

           writing.

                          PRESENTER

           How has it affected the hospital

           Doctor?

                          MIXTER

           Obviously we were all left very

           numb by events for a long time and

           I know a lot of people in the town

           felt we should close the

           institution. But that never

           occurred to me. I feel that people

           should be brought closer by tragedy

           and the Staff and I have definitely

           become closer, both as colleagues

           and friends, since the incident.

           That bond makes for a better

           87.

           institution in my opinion, so we

           will continue to go from strength

           to strength.

                          PRESENTER

           You mentioned there that some

           people wanted the place to close. I

           know many were also resistant to

           the opening of the institution in

           the first place given that it was

           built on the site of the infamous

           house, where Ronald DeFeo murdered

           his family in the seventies. I know

           a lot of people associated with

           that case were accused of

           exploiting it for their own ends.

           You've also faced some criticism

           for that, particularly as we heard

           last week that you have sold the

           movie rights to this book. How do

           you respond to that criticism?

                          MIXTER

           Well I know that some people accuse

           me of hurting the memory of the

           victims but I feel I'm helping the

           memories of those involved live on.

           Granted, some victims were

           criminally insane but other victims

           were loyal staff who had families

           and I'm determined that they not be

           forgotten. Each staff member gets

           their own chapter in the book so

           that the readers can get a full

           picture of what wonderful people

           they were. I always say that all

           forms of media, whether it be

           books, newspapers, TV or movies,

           are a preservation of life. Our

           physical bodies may die but our

           images live on when we are famous.

           Our work and our passion is

           preserved, therefore it's as if our

           souls are preserved. Through all of

           these forms of media we are, in

           effect, immortal.

          CUT TO BLACK

                          88

          The sound of children singing the nursery rhyme "Ring Around

          a Rosie" in a slow, haunting manner echoes around our ears.

                         CREDITS ROLL

          THE END.
