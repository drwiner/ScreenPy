	Pg-1

				     RESIDENT EVIL

	PRESENTATION CREDITS appear... then FADE...

	Out of BLACK... SHOCK CUT TO:

	INT   LAB   "A" LEVEL   TIMELESS

	A MAN'S FACE, filling the screen.

				MARCUS (filter)

			Stay away from here!

	We're watching A VIDEO MONITOR. A pre-recorded tape shows

	a view of what is obviously a pristine-RESEARCH LABORATORY.

	DR. JOHN MARCUS, in a lab coat, faces THE CAMERA, disheveled

	and looking like a madman.

				MARCUS (cont. filter)

			This lab must remain sealed!

	INT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS

	Overhead lamps cast pools of LIGHT down onto A CONFERENCE

	TABLE, onto THE HANDS of PEOPLE assembled to observe the

	video. We see NO FACES. But expensive WATCHES, sleeves

	with high-ranking STRIPES, indicate wealth, power, and a

	military presence.

	THE VIDEO: On the wall behind MARCUS, we see SHADOWS darting

	frantically. We hear VOICES rising in panic.

				MARCUS (cont. Filter)

			For God's sake, don't come in!

	The CAMERA is SWATTED by A HAND that lurches suddenly into

	the foreground. We only see it for a few video frames, but

	we might subliminally notice LESIONS on the flesh. The IMAGE

	SWIRLS wildly. The next clear picture we see... is of the

	same laboratory...topsy-turvy. THE CAMERA is lying on its

	side on the floor.

				VOICE IN THE ROOM (o.s.)

			Look.  Here.

	A LASER POINTER casts a RED DOT on a corner of the video

	screen, indicating A HUNCHED FIGURE, leaning over A HUMAN

	BODY, apparently ...feeding! With a GRUNT, the figure turns.

	and LUNGES, it's face covered with BLOOD, at the CAMERA. The

	image SWIRLS again, and the SCREEN GOES BLACK. With a MUSIC

	STING, a single TITLE appears, full across the blackness...

			        RESIDENT EVIL

	Pg-2

	EXT  FOREST LAND   PRE-DAWN

	A DARK SKY ...and in the foreground, profiled against a FULL

	MOON, A DARK FACE ...watching the heavens with piercing black

	eyes, alert, though not predatory. This is CHRIS REDFIELD,

	young, handsome. More than simply an outdoor type, he seems

	perfectly in place, almost part of the environment.

	A band of purple tints the horizon, outlining the tops of

	magnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles. Sitting

	on a ridge, squinting into that band of light, Chris sees ...

	...AN EAGLE coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through

	the hilltops. As the bird moves swiftly closer, it becomes

	recognizable. Chris smiles and jots a note on a pad.

	The regal bird lands on a high rock where ...unexpectedly...

	a freshwater trout lies flapping, three-thousand feet above

	the highest water.

				CHRIS

			Take it, Goliath. It's yours.

	"Goliath" snaps up the fish and flies away with it.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			See ya next year, guy.

	Chris reaches into a water-filled bucket, pulls out another

	trout, climbs efficiently, unerringly, across a precarious

	Cliffside, and deposits the fresh fish on the-same high rock.

	ANOTHER EAGLE, smaller, a female, appears in the sky.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			Cleopatra.

	Chris scrambles back to his place and jots another note.

	"Cleopatra" spots the fish, pumps her wings, and swoops down.

	She's about to snap up the prize, but at the last minute, she

	recoils and climbs again, hovering.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			Come on. Come on down.

	The eagle circles, its sharp eyes scanning. It makes another

	dive, but stops short again.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			What's the matter, beautiful?

	The bird seems frightened.  Of what? It makes one more dive.

	Gets very close to the fish... but suddenly SHRIEKS and peels,

	away from the rock. Chris sees its eyes, looking crazed, as

	it soars right past him, its wings brushing his hair.

	Pg-3

	CLOSE ON: CHRIS, concerned, as he watches the eagle disappear

	over the hills.

	Over his shoulder, we can see the high rock that holds the

	fish. It's out of focus in the background, but the moonlight

	catches SOMETHING MOVING there. Something that lets out a

	sharp INHUMAN SOUND.

	Chris whirls around. There's nothing on the rock. Nothing

	at all. The fish has been taken.

	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   DAWN

	CHRIS walks into a characterless apartment. He quietly

	sheds his clothes. Even in silhouette, we can see that his

	body is in perfect shape, not pumped, but lean and tight.

	Moving lithely, with the natural grace of a cat, he eases

	himself into a bed where...

	...a beautiful young girl, JILL VALENTINE, seems to be fast

	asleep. As Chris nestles in beside her, we see that her

	eyes, facing away, are open. Chris gently drapes an arm

	around her and lets his body relax.

				CHRIS

			(A whisper) Glad you're still 

			here, lady

				JILL

			It's my apartment.

				CHRIS

			(Surprised) You're awake.

				JILL

			I've been awake. Since you left.

				CHRIS

			Sorry.

	His apology goes no further. He's still troubled by what

	happened in the hills.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			There was... something wrong.

				JILL

			What, with my dinner? I never had

			a mother. I'll learn.

	Chris smiles politely. He offers...

				CHRIS

			I'll do the cooking.

	Pg-4

	...but he can't switch focus.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			On the mountain...there...must

			have been something... prowling

			around up there.

				JILL

			There are probably all kinds of

			things prowling around up there.

			In the middle of the night.

	Chris apologizes again, this time more sincerely.

				CHRIS

			I'm sorry. Really. You...have to

			be there at dawn. They ride the

			wind over the ridge.

				JILL

			Dawn? You left at one A.M.

				CHRIS

			I had to go fishing. It's the fish

			that bring them down, so I can get

			a close look at them. (Enthused)

			I've tracked a dozen of them, Jill.

			Twelve of those big bruisers. I can

			actually recognize them. I've even

			given them names, over the years.

				JILL

			You've been doing this for years?

				CHRIS

			Only in the early Autumn. When

			they're' migrating.

				JILL

			I'II set the alarm for next. October.

	Jill rolls over and faces him.

				JILL (cont.)

			I wish I could get excited. Really.

			That's the truth. As excited as you,

			over such... simple things.

				CHRIS

			Beauty... isn't simple. If it was...

			I'd be beautiful.

				JILL

			You are.

	Pg-5

				CHRIS

			No, no, no.  I'm simple.  You, on the

			other hand...(nuzzling closer)...have

			all that... stuff... hiding underneath

			somewhere. That's what fascinates me.

				JILL

			Fascination. Not love?

	Jill is being playful. Chris, taking her question to heart,

	becomes introspective.

				CHRIS

			I... honestly don't know. I guess

			I've been... living alone too long.

			You're the first, the only woman I've

			ever thought of as... a real partner.

	Now Jill becomes introspective.

				JILL

			I've always been...afraid of living

			alone. I've always had... people...

			talking at me... knowing they could

			wind me up and I'd do... (shrug) ...

			whatever they wanted.

	Chris looks into her eyes. She kisses him gently.

				JILL (cont.)

			We all have... something hidden...

			underneath.  Beauty may not be simple.

			But it's not all that complicated,

			Either.  Most of the time, you find

			It... right in the middle of all the...

			confusion.

				CHRIS

			I'm part Mohawk. Indians are never

			confused. At least, they never let

			it show.

	They kiss again, this time more passionately. Rolling over,

	they begin to make love.

	EXT   FARM   DAWN

	The purple horizon is turning orange, but it's still quite

	dark when a crusty old farm-hand, RAKE, opens the creaking

	door of a stable and, with a flashlight, leads THREE HORSES

	out into the morning breeze.

	Two dogs, A LAB and A SPANIEL, romp at his heels as Rake

	opens a log gate.

	Pg-6

	-

	Two of the untethered horses trot obediently into a large

	corral. The third, a beautiful stallion, resists, snorting,

	tossing its head in high spirit.

				RAKE

			Get in there, Lucky. Quit horsin'

			around. Get in.

	"LUCKY" moves into the corral, strutting proudly.

				RAKE (cont.)

			Swear. If I didn't know you was

			just an animal, I'd say you was all

			full of yourself. GET IN THERE!

	Rake waves his flashlight, not meanly, there is clearly a

	great deal of affection here. Rake shuts the gate behind

	the stallion, who begins to gallop around happily inside

	the fence. All seems lovely, until...

	...the dogs suddenly go on point. Their ears perk. They

	sniff the air...and begin to WHINE.

				RAKE (cont.)

			What's wrong with you two?

	KER-RAAKK! A startling SOUND. Rake turns to find Lucky and

	the other horses, their eyes flaring, trying to KICK their

	way out of the fencing. They seem terrified.

	CUT TO :

	A WIDE SHOT:  of RAKE, and the frightened ANIMALS, from

	two hundred yards away. THE CAMERA MOVES IN, slowly at

	first, then gaining speed... extraordinary SPEED. We are

	seeing THROUGH THE EYES OF... whatever it is that's running,

	charging, SLATHERING HUNGRILY...

	...reaching the corral, DARTING through the fence, past the

	KICKING HORSES, and LEAPING at Rake, who whirls around...and

	CRIES OUT in pain as his flashlight BLINDS us with WHITENESS.

	EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN

	The WHITENESS becomes the GLARE of HALOGEN LIGHTS. We are

	overwhelmed by the SOUND of AIRCRAFT ENGINES. We see MEN,

	armed SOLDIERS, scrambling into combat HELICOPTERS.

	A RADIO MAN runs right toward THE CAMERA, holding out an

	open receiver.

				RADIO MAN

			Top brass, sir!

	Pg-7

	ANOTHER MAN, in the foreground, takes the radio-phone. We

	can't see his face. Only his forearm, which bears A TATTOO

	of a grinning SKULL.

				MAN WITH TATTOO

			Alpha Leader.

				VOICE ON PHONE (o.s. filter)

			How long before you get in there?

				MAN WITH TATTOO

			Fifteen minutes.

	INT   AN OFFICE   DAWN

	A SUIT talks on a red telephone. Once again, we see no face.

	An ostentatious diamond RING kicks light as the man snips off

	the end off a Monte Cristo.

				MAN WITH RING

			You're good, soldier. But not that

			good. It's five hundred miles away.

			In the backwoods of Pennsylvania.

				MAN WITH TATTOO (o.s. filter)

			We have troopers on site. A first-

			strike force. Under cover.

	The flame from a wooden match lights the Monte Cristo.

				MAN WITH RING

			Very resourceful.  You have my

			permission activate them.

	EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN

				MAN WITH TATTOO

			I've already done that. You have my

			permission... to say that you gave me

			permission.

	THE TATTOOED MAN runs off to join the other SOLDIERS.

	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING

	CHRIS sleeps. JILL is awake, deep in thought, when...

	...BRRRRT! It's not a ring, it's a vibration. Jill reaches

	down and extracts something small and black, the size of a

	box of Tic-Tacs, from one of her shoes. She gets out of bed,

	checking to see that Chris is still asleep, and moves into...

	Pg-8

	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   BATHROOM   MORNING

	...a bathroom. Closing the door behind her, she puts the

	small box to her ear, extracts a wire from it, with a tiny

	microphone on its tip, and...

				JILL

			(Softly) Valentine.

	We can't hear the voice that speaks to her.

				JILL (cont.)

			If this is just another a drill,

			I'll strangle you. (She listens)

			Shit. Give me the activation code.

	JILL pulls a small ENVELOPE from a toiletry bag. She breaks

	open a wax seal...and takes out a thick paper on which is

	printed... 29-RC-6735.

				JILL (cont.)

			(Gaping, not believing) Th-that's

			a match. (Beat) I'm on my way.

	Jill clicks off. She dumps something else from the envelope

	into her hand... A BLUE PLASTIC CARD, the size of a Visa,

	blank except for a mag-stripe. There's a small hole in one

	corner, through which a chain is strung. Jill slings the

	chain over head, wearing the blue card like a pendant.

	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING

	CHRIS is still asleep. JILL comes out of the bathroom and

	looks down at him longingly.  Should she wake him?  Tell him

	what's happening?  She wants to, but duty prevents it.  She

	pulls herself away.

	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   CLOSET   MORNING

	TCHIK TCHIK TCHIK...JILL pushes aside hangers which hold her

	clothes. She types numbers into a hidden KEYPAD. A SECRET

	PANEL OPENS, revealing a CLOSET WITHIN THE CLOSET, packed

	with COMBAT UNIFORMS and WEAPONS.

	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING

	The sound... TCHUNG... of the front door closing snaps CHRIS

	awake.  His first thought is for his lover.  He reaches out

	and finds that... she's not in bed.  He jumps up, rushes to

	a window, looks down, from the second story, and sees...

	Pg-9

	EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING

	...JILL, heavily ARMED, in UNIFORM, wearing a beret that has

	an insignia... S.T.A.R.S. She rushes down the front path and

	jumps into A HUMMER with THREE OTHER TROOPERS on board. The

	vehicle pulls instantly away...

	...leaving Chris, looking through the window, puzzled, angry,

	and very much wounded.

	INT/EXT   HUMMER   MORNING

	RUSSO drives. WILLIAMS and DISIMONE sit in the back, all

	tough Special-Forces types. JILL, in the front passenger

	seat, though the only female, ranks the highest.

				DISIMONE

			Another practice run, right?

				RUSSO

			We been practicin' six months!

			For what?

				JILL

			For this. This is the real deal.

				WILLIAMS

			Honest to God?

				JILL

			Based on my experience, Williams,

			God isn't always honest

				DISIMONE

			Where we goin'?

				JILL

			In there.

	Jill points into THE ARKLEY FOREST which lies ahead. Miles

	of old growth-trees shrouded in a ghostly morning mist.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT   THE FOREST   MORNING

	DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE MIST... THE HUMMER bounces over

	non-roads and stops fifty yards from...

	...A PAIR OF IRON GATES, each wrought with the letter "A".

	Beyond, the shifting fog offers momentary glimpses of...

	A MANSION.  Huge.  Like Xandau.  THE TROOPERS, amazed,

	climb out and approach the gates.

	Pg-10

				RUSSO

			If you had the jing to build a place

			like this, would you build it in the

			middle of fuckin' nowhere?

				WILLIAMS

			Paris.

				DISIMONE

			Manhattan. Upper west.

				JILL

			(Wistfully) Some people prefer...

			a quiet life. (Back to business)

			Our orders are to secure the area.

				DISIMONE

			From what? This area's been 'secure'

			since the French and Indian War!

	A deep, animal SNARL comes from the woods.  The troopers

	raise their weapons as they peer into the underbrush.  The

	fog keeps sunlight from penetrating.  The forest is a maze

	of dark shadows. Leaves flutter.  Limbs SNAP.  Then...

	DARK SHAPES can be seen moving, circling.  A half-dozen

	of them.  Maybe more.  Jill whips out a transmitter and

	quickly types an access code.

				JILL

			(Into radio) This is Valentine,

			Bravo Team. We, er... we might be

			in trouble, here.

	KRITCH! Something LEAPS out of the brush. Automatic

	WEAPONS SPIT reflexively.

	KRITCH KRITCH KRITCH...more lunging SHAES appear. The

	troopers scatter, firing, as they are attacked from all

	sides. Jill dives for the shrubbery, shouting into her

	transmitter.

				JILL (cont.)

			WE ARE IN TROUBLE!

	CUT TO :

	INT   HUEY   MORNING

	JILL'S VOICE stutters over a headset which is pressed against

	A MAN'S EAR.

				JILL (o.s. filter)

			Under attack... by.. .assailants...

			Unidentifi...

	Pg-11

	Static. Hissing air. The SHOT WIDENS as the man lowers his

	headset. First we see the TATTOO on his arm... a grinning

	SKULL which we recognize. Then, gradually, we see his face.

	Lean and mean, wearing dark sunglasses, this is ALBERT

	WESKER, a hard-assed career officer.

				WESKER

			Can you get a trace?

	The pilot, LAGUARDIA, responds.

				LAGUARDIA

			Lost the beacon. It just cut out.

			Like it was...swallowed by something.

	Oddly, Wesker smiles.

				WESKER

			I do believe, gentlemen...that we're

			gonna be earning some combat pay.

	There are three other MEN on board. The closest to Wesker

	is BARRY BURTON, a muscular black man, as big as a grizzly,

	with the heart of a Teddy.

				BARRY

			Damn, if you don't love a fight.

				WESKER

			Hey, if I didn't... you'd be a dead

			man. (To the pilot) Call in a nine-

			nine. I want Raccoon City e-vacked.

	Wesker and the men fly from the lens.  THE CAMERA passes

	Out through one of the helicopter's windows as the chopper soars

	away.  When the SHOT WIDENS, we see OTHER HUEYS...black,

	unmarked, keeping formation.  Three... six...ten of them.

	EXT   FOREST   MORNING

	GUNS BLAZE. THE TROOPERS are under assault by thrashing,

	inhuman SHAPES...GROWLING, SNAPPING. JILL rolls into a

	natural trench.  DISIMONE is behind her, WILLIAMS is

	crawling just ahead, his legs pumping.  Jill scoots past

	him and sees that...

	...those legs aren't moving on their own.  They've been

	RIPPED AWAY FROM WILLIAMS' TORSO and are being dragged into

	the underbrush by some... BEAST... concealed in the thick

	brush, so we never get a clear look at it.

	OTHER BEASTS attack DiSimone.  Then Russo.  We see only

	details.  Jill fires her pistol, point blank... to no avail.

	RED-RIMMED EYES, SNARLING JAWS, DROOLING TEETH descend on

	her as we CUT TO:

	Pg-12

	EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT BUILDING   MORNING

	CHRIS steps out of Jill's building. Suddenly, incongruously,

	camo-painted HUEYS swoop down out of the sky.

	EXT   RACCOON CITY   MAIN STREET   MORNING

	THE CHOPPERS land where they can. COMMANDOS leap out and

	begin to cordon off the town.  Bullhorns blare.

	BULLHORN

	There's been an accident in the

	hills nearby. A military aircraft,

	carrying live weapons, has crashed...

	EXT   RACCOON CITY   SIDE STREET   MORNING

	CHRIS runs down a side-street into AN ALLEY, where he's

	trapped by COMMANDOS, both in front and behind.

				SOLDIER

			Let's go, hayseed. (Aiming his M-16)

			You gonna be a good boy?

	Chris swallows his fury. Gritting his teeth, he goes along

	with the soldiers, prodded, by rifle barrels, out onto...

	EXT   RACCOON CITY  MAIN STREET   MORNING

	...Main Street, where there is CHAOS... an Orwellian sight,

	as CITIZENS find themselves horded into helicopters and

	TRUCKS from the local National Guard Post.

	A sweating man, still in his pajamas, rushes up to the

	SOLDIERS that are escorting CHRIS.

				MAN

			Look here, I'm the Sheriff of this...

				SOLDIER

			Step aside.

				SHERIFF

			But, I'm the Sheriff! An ex-Army man, like you.

				BULLHORN (o.s.)

			There is no immediate danger, but

			as a precaution, we are evacuating

			the area. You will be provided

			shelter until the weapons have been

			removed from the crash site.

	Pg-13

				SHERRIFF

			That's a worn-out scenario. If

			a plane crashed nearby, don't you

			think somebody would have heard

			it go down? Tell us the truth,

			guys. What's this really about?

				SOLDIER

			I said, STEP ASIDE!

	The soldier lifts his rifle. He's about to CLUB the sheriff

	when Chris lunges, grabbing his arm. WHOOMPH! Chris kicks

	the soldier in the balls. The man buckles. Chris bolts.

	One of the other commandos FIRES at him, a loud BURST which

	misses Chris but SHATTERS a shop window, setting off wild

	PANIC on the street. Chris ducks into a building...

	EXT   RACCOON CITY   BACK STREET   MORNING

	...and out a rear door. He runs through a warren of back

	alleyways, arriving at...

	...A JEEP SAHARA which is parked behind Jill's apartment

	building. He jumps in without opening the door, jams the key

	into the ignition, and ROARS off.

	INT   HUEY   MORNING

	Still airborne, in one of the black helicopters that have yet

	to reach the site, WESKER barks orders into a radio.

				WESKER

			Charlie, David, Edward, proceed to

			Raccoon City. Assist the e-vack.

			I'm going on target with Alpha Team.

			All forces stand ready to support.

	EXT   FARM   MORNING

	CHRIS rumbles his jeep onto a picturesque FARM, secluded deep

	in the forest. We don't recognize it immediately. It was

	dark when we last saw the place.

	Jumping out, Chris sees three large SHAPES lying in the grass

	of a corral. Rushing over, Chris realizes...

	...they're HORSES. One of them is LUCKY, his prize

	stallion... DEAD, in a pool of BLOOD, with its belly torn

	open and a huge chunk out of its neck.

				CHRIS

			Aw, no... (Devastated) ...L-Lucky.

	Pg-14

	Chris hears a weak, MOANING SOUND. He turns and sees...

	RAKE, lying near a water pump. Chris rushes to the man's

	side and finds him brutally SLASHED, barely clinging to life.

				RAKE

			(Coughing blood) They... they come

			outta the trees, Reddy. Don't... don't

			know what they was. Figure... maybe

			some kinda... wolves, or somethin' ...

	Examining the man's wounds, Chris realizes they're fatal.

				RAKE

			I... I never seen 'em comin'.

				CHRIS

			Don't try to talk, Rake.

				RAKE (cont.)

			I... ain't... never left this farm...

			untended... since yer daddy first

			took it over.

				CHRIS

			I know. You... kept the place runnin'...

			better than me.

				RAKE

			I just...never seen 'em comin', Reddy.

			Never even...had a chance to...turn

			a gun on 'em.

	There's a THUNDER in the sky. Chris looks up. Wesker's

	Fleet of black HUEYS appears on the horizon.  They split up,

	Seven banking off toward Raccoon City, the remaining three

	grinding ahead over the forest, slowing down, dropping in

	altitude.

				CHRIS

			Where are they going? There's

			nothing in there... except...

				RAKE

			Y'oughta... remember it... real good.

			I do.  From... when you was a kid.

				CHRIS

			The... the old Arkley place?

				RAKE

			I remember them days. I surely do...

			Remember them... them old days.

	Chris looks back down at the old man, who is drifting,

	starting to lose it.

	Pg-15

				CHRIS (cont.)

			I'm not gonna bullshit you, Rake.

			You're...in a bad time. If there's

			any way to save you, I'll find it,

			I swear. You just... hang in there,

			old guy. I'll be right back.

	Chris jumps to his feet and runs into...

	INT   FARMHOUSE   MORNING

	...the great-room of the FARMHOUSE. Rustic. Cozy. CHRIS

	snatches up a telephone. There's no dial-tone. The line

	is dead. Chris rushes to a gun cabinet and pulls out an old

	WINCHESTER rifle. He scoops ammo from a drawer into a

	shoulder bag and runs back outside...

	EXT   FARM   MORNING

	...where his eyes catch MOVEMENT in the corral. LUCKY,

	entrails spilling, is trying to stand.

				CHRIS

			Oh, God, Rake. Oh, Jesus, the poor thing's still alive.

	Chris shoulders his ammo bag, reaches inside, and quickly

	reloads the Winchester. Stepping forward, he aims carefully.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			Sorry, old hoss.

	BLAM!  A clean shot to the horse's brain drops the animal.

	It takes Chris a long moment to recover... then, he looks into

	the trees. The helicopters are no longer in sight, but their

	THUNDER remains.  They haven't landed yet.

	Chris turns and rushes back to Rake's side, only to find...

	...he has died. Chris' jaws tighten, but he has no time

	to mourn. He closes Rake's eyes. Digs through the grass.

	Pulls up a handful of dirt. Stuffs it into the old man's

	hand, and closes his stiffening fingers over it.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			The earth keeps us.

	Conquering his emotions, Chris runs to his jeep and jumps in.

	He shifts into four-wheel-drive and, ignoring the road, heads

	straight over the field for the trees.

	As the jeep disappears, THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN, ZOOMING

	IN ON...

	Pg-16

	...one of the farm dogs. The SPANIEL. Not the entire

	animal, but one of its three SEPARATE PARTS... it's front

	end... CRUSHED head, BLOODY neck, and a single BROKEN paw...

	...which is trying to CRAWL.

	Fifty yards away, RAKE'S HAND relaxes. The earth spills out

	through his fingers as the dead man's eyes... POP OPEN.

	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MORNING

	THE FIRST OF THE BLACK HUEYS drops, hazardously, into a

	small clearing with barely enough space. Unable to land

	on the scrub-brush, it hovers ten feet off the ground. Its

	rotors CLIP TREE LEAVES as WESKER, BARRY, and TWO OTHER

	S.T.A.R.S. COMMANDOS jump out, heavily armed. The chopper

	lifts off, placed by HUEY NUMBER TWO.

	NOT FAR AWAY, CHRIS navigates through undergrowth until he

	can see THE HELICOPTERS through the trees. The THUNDER from

	their rotors masks the grinding of Chris' jeep. He pulls

	within a hundred yards and, leaving his vehicle in the bush,

	moves closer, cautiously, on foot.

	THE THIRD HUEY air-drops TWO MEN and TWO WOMEN in S.T.A.R.S.

	uniforms. There are TWELVE COMMANDOS in all... ALPHA TEAM.

	Wesker looks up at the Huey's PILOT, using his radio to speak

	to the man.

				WESKER

			You'll have to rotate or you'll run

			out of fuel, but I want one chopper

			to remain in the air at all times.

			We might need help in a hurry.

	A "Roger that", squaks back as the Huey banks away.

	Barry looks worried. His instincts are asking... "We might

	need... 'help'".  Against what? We only see this in his eyes,

	he says nothing as...

	...Wesker leads the team through the woods, unaware of...

	...CHRIS, following behind, crouching around trees and

	bushes, not a trained commando, but comfortable with the

	land, a natural warrior using ancestral instincts.

	THE CAMERA TRACKS COMBAT BOOTS as they CRUNCH through the

	low-Lying MIST.. .stopping abruptly when they encounter...

	...WEAPONS, AMMO BELTS, bits of SHRDDED UNIFORMS... and

	HUMAN BODY PARTS... strewn all through the surrounding brush,

	remnants of what was obviously a feeding-frenzy.

	Pg-17

				VICKERS

			Holy... Goh... gaah...

	BRAD VICKERS vomits. Unarmed, he's Alpha Team's computer-

	techie. Not a combat soldier, he's a bit of a coward.

	Another non-combatant, REBECCA CHAMBERS, is the team's

	medical officer. She digs an ammonia capsule from her

	pack and holds it under Vickers' nose.

	RICHARD AIKEN and KENNETH SULLIVAN are buddies, regular

	G.I. Joes, right out of every war movie. Aiken stares at

	the carnage, calmly chewing a wad of gum.

				AIKEN

			You ever eat road-kill, Sullivan?

				SULLIVAN

			Aiken... a guy with a brain your

			size would be better off dead.

				RODRIGUEZ (o.s.)

			Want me to shoot ya, Aiken?

	ROSIE RODRIGUEZ, a tough, body-built babe steps in.

				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)

			I'm ready ta shoot somebody.

				ALKEN

			I'll pass. Shoot Sullivan.

	FOREST SPEYER, a wiry Willem Defoe type, finds a bloody BERET

	and brings it to Wesker.  There's an I.D. tag on the brim...

				WESKER

			(Reading the tag) 'Valentine'. (Beat)

			Radio Washington.  Bravo Team found

			on site. No survivors.

	In the bushes, Chris overhears, not wanting to believe. He

	sees Wesker angrily pitch Jill's beret into the brush.

				WESKER

			We're goin' in.  Watch your backs.

	Wesker advances his troops. When the coast is clear, Chris

	rushes in, picks up the beret, and sees the name tag for

	himself. "Valentine ".

	After what happened at the farm... now this... feeling sucker-

	punched, defeated, Chris hangs his head.

	One of the HUEYS dips in low.

	Pg-18

	Chris looks up. The sight of the war machine lifts him from

	defeat... to rage.  His eyes are soft, for the last time, as

	he tucks Jill's beret into his pack.  When he looks up again,

	those eyes have become newly predatory.  He ducks out of

	sight as the helicopter swings lower.

	Downdraft from the rotors makes the bushes rustle, catching

	Chris' attention.  He realizes that... it's not just the wind.

	The shrubs are being disturbed by...

	SOMETHING DARK which is moving through them.  It pokes

	its head out.  A WOLF! Rake was right.  Chris readies his

	Winchester as the animal stalks forward.

	It's not a wolf. It's A DOG. Mottled, its flesh gray,

	covered with rotting lesions... and it has three bleeding

	BULLET HOLES in its belly, chest, neck.

	GROWRRR!  It LEAPS at Chris... who fires... BLAM!

	Up ahead, Wesker and his commandos freeze.

				WESKER

			Who fired? WHO FIRED?

	Before anyone can answer, the team is ATTACKED by MORE DOGS

	which BURST out of the surrounding woods...DOBERMANS and

	SHEPHERDS... but something is seriously wrong with all of

	them. Their EYES are DEAD, their FLESH decaying.

	Automatics piss streams of lead. Hot rounds TEAR through the

	animals, many of the slugs accidentally blowing out brains.

	of his bullets hits its target... one of the dogs' heads.

	The commandos are backed up against... the IRON GATES we

	saw earlier. The Arkley Mansion stands beyond.

				RODRIGUEZ

			Let's get inside.

				WESKER (cont.)

			NO! (Shouting) I WANT 'EM ALL

			DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? STAND FAST...

			UNTIL THEY ARE ALL DEAD !

	The dogs don't stand a chance. Alpha Team's firepower is

	overwhelming. But there is a human casualty. JOSEPH FROST

	trips and falls. One of the dogs POUNCES on him, chewing

	out his HEART... through his BACK.

	Wesker steps in, RIDDLING the dead man, and the dog, with

	forty rounds from his M-16.

	Pg-19

	In the next instant, ANOTHER DOG LEAPS at Wesker from behind.

	He hears its snarl... too late.  He dives into the grass...

	too late.  The dog is about to land on him when...

	...it's BLASTED out of mid air by... Barry.

				BARRY

			Even-Steven, boss.  You saved my

			ass in the desert.  I saved yours I

			in Pennsylvania.

	Wesker stand, straightening his ever-present sunglasses.

				WESKER

			I don't believe in being... 'Even-

			Steven' with anybody.  A man saves

			my ass...I pay him back.  Before

			this day is over, I'll pay you back,

			Barry.  Just... stick with me, okay?

	Wesker checks his equipment belt. Something is missing.

	He looks to where he rolled in the grass. Using a FLASH-

	LIGHT, he finds...

	...a small electronic unit the size of a cell-phone. But

	it's not a cell-phone. Whatever it is... Wesker clips it

	onto his belt.

	FROM THE BRUSH, Chris sees all this. The guns have gone

	silent. The attack seems to be over. Chris moves stealthily

	to the body of the animal that he shot. It's wearing a

	COLLAR which reads...

				  SPIKE #26

	Alongside the I.D., there's a corporate-looking logo... the

	symbol of an UMBRELLA.

	GRRROWWWLL! ANOTHER DOG is advancing on Chris. He aims

	his Winchester.  CLICK! The magazine is empty.  No time to

	reload.  The dog is on him.  Chris SCRAMBLES away.  The dog

	BOUNDS after him.

	Chris drops to the ground.  Did he trip?  No.  He pushes a

	TREE ROOT, which is FALSE.  It swings open and he dives in,

	pulling the root shut over him.

	The dog arrives an instant later.  It lets out an angry

	howl... and is BLOWN AWAY... by RODRIGUEZ, who neither saw

	Chris, nor where he went.

	The forest goes dead quiet.  Too quiet.  There's not even

	the chirping of morning birds Wesker is SLAPPED startlingly

	on the back... by Barry.

	Pg-20

				BARRY

			Look here, man.  I'd follow you

			into any kind of enemy fire.  But

			these things ain't firin' at us.

			They want us for breakfast!  When

			are you gonna tell us what the

			hell is goin' on here?

				WESKER

			When you need to know.  Just do

			your job, soldier.  That's what

			I'm doin'.  My job.

	Wesker pulls a chain from under his shirt. It holds a card,

	the size of a Visa, like the one Jill found in her secret

	envelope, only Wesker's isn't blue, it's green.

	Stepping away from Barry, he slide the card through a slot

	in the iron gate-frame.  BUZZZZ.  The GATES SWING OPEN with

	a rusty SQUEAL.

	INT   TUNNEL   MORNING

	CHRIS crawls through a long, dark shaft with earthen walls,

	a man-made tunnel.

	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MANSION   MORNING

	AT THE MANSION'S FRONT DOOR, a hand-carved monolith of solid

	oak, WESKER finds another hidden SLOT and swipes his card.

	The giant door CREAKS OPEN.

	INT   MANSION   CENTRAL HALL   MORNING

	INSIDE, the place looks like a HAUNTED HOUSE, a glorious

	ruin, once spectacular, now mysterious and threatening.

	The chandeliers and furniture are covered with sheets that

	ripple on breezes from a thousand faults in the old walls.

	Indistinct NOISES echo within the ceiling, the floor, as

	ALPHA TEAM enters.

				AIKEN

			Old. They probably don't have cable.

				SULLIVAN

			They probably don't have radio.

				RODRIGUEZ

			Who's they? Who's place is this?

	WESKER shuts the front door. The BOOMING SOUND makes us

	wonder if we will ever see it opened again.

	Pg-21

				WESKER

			Guy named Arkley.  Bootlegger.  Built

			this old fortress during prohibition.

			He figured nobody'd ever find him out

			here in the back woods.  Nobody did.

			Till he died.  Feds have had it ever

			since.  Place has been here for eighty

			years... derelict... a safe-house.

				BARRY

			A safe-house... for who? For what?

				WESKER

			There's a... a secret installation.

			Below.  A network of laboratories.

				REBECCA

			What kind of... laboratories?

				WESKER

			(Shrugging) They didn't issue us

			gas-masks, so I figure... it's okay

			to breathe.

				RODRIGUEZ

			Why send in a strike-force?

				SULLIVAN

			Yeah. What are we supposed to do?

			Polish the silver?

				WESKER (cont.)

			There's a man downstairs. A top-

			priority man.  It's our job to...

			bring him out.  Hopefully, there

			are others alive, as well. We'll

			Rescue them, too... if we can...but

			Dr. John Marcus... he comes out alive

			at any and all cost.

	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   MORNING

	Though it's still morning, the windows are sealed over.  No

	sunshine can enter. From this point on... there will be no

	indication of time... except as shown on clocks.  A sense of

	dread takes hold of us as...

	...dark SHADOWS LURCH...FEET SCRAPE sluggishly... not in

	combat boots, but in Nikes, loafers, Dr. Martens... past an

	accordion GATE of corroded bronze.  A motor HUMS.  Behind

	the gate, an old-fashioned service ELEVATOR rises... but stops

	just below floor level. EYES peer out, waiting for the

	shuffling feet to pass.  Then the car rises the rest of

	the way, revealing its occupant...

	Pg-22

	...JILL VALENTINE! She's alive! She deactivates the

	elevator by pulling her blue ACCESS CARD out of an incon-

	gruously modern receptacle. Checking to be sure that the

	coast is clear, she slides the accordion gate aside and

	steps out into the corridor.

	With a ghostly MOAN, something LUNGES at her out of the

	shadows. It's A MAN in a lab coat. His skin is ROTTING,

	his teeth SNAPPING, like the dogs'. He tries to BITE Jill,

	not merely to do injury. He seems HUNGRY!

	Jill leaps aside, lifting her pistol and FIRING... once,

	twice, three times. The man is shot in the stomach, heart,

	neck...but he keeps coming! Finally, Jill shoots him in the

	head...and he falls.

	Jill quickly reloads, on instinct. But as she does it, she

	stares at the corpse, frowning, weighing life-long belief

	against the hideous facts of the moment.

	INT   MANSION   CENTRAL HALL   MORNING

	WESKER and his troopers hear the GUNSHOTS. There are THREE

	DOORS nearby. Wesker selects one that seems to lead to the

	source of the gunshots. Using his card, he unlocks it.

				WESKER

			Three men stay here. Chambers...

				REBECCA

			I'm not a man.

				WESKER

			Rodriguez...

				RODRIGUEZ

			I'm better than a man.

	Wesker grins, but hardly skips a beat.

				WESKER

			Alright. you come with us. Aiken,

			Sullivan, stick here with Chambers.

	The troop moves out. Aiken and Sullivan remain in the

	central hall with Rebecca.

				AIKEN

			Why us?

				SULLIVAN

			I dunno why me. You? I guess the

			C.O. figures you're as worthless

			as a dame, Aiken.

	Pg-23

	Sullivan catches Rebecca's eye.

				SULLIVAN (cont.)

			Er... sorry, ma' am. I... I didn't  ...

			I meant Aiken... Not you.

				REBECCA

			Relax. I get it.

	INT   MANSION LIBRARY   TIMELESS

	WESKER leads his TROOP into an enormous, cobwebbed library

	lined with book shelves, but no books. There are doorways

	on all four walls. Wesker pulls out something that looks

	like a Game-Boy. He types on a keypad. A MAP of the mansion

	appears. Wesker scrolls with the arrow-keys. Barry looks

	on very impressed with the high-tech unit.

				BARRY

			That thing...tells you where to go?

	Wesker doesn't answer. He pockets the "Game Boy".

				WESKER

			One man stays here. Ridley. You're

			it. Shoot to kill. Just make sure

			it's not one of us. The rest of you...

			this way.

	Wesker, leads his squad through one of the doorways. RIDLEY,

	a young rookie, remains.

	INT   UNDERGROUND CAVERN   TIMELESS

	CHRIS reaches the end of the earthen tunnel. There are

	signs that children once played here... TOY SOLDIERS.

	GRAFFITI.  Chris finds his nickname... Christopher Reddy...

	etched in hardened mud.  After a moment of reflection,

	he moves on, into...

	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS

	...a small, sheet-rock chamber.  CHRIS rushes to a DOOR

	that looks like it's been there since the beginning of time.

	As soon as he touches the knob... AN ALARM SOUNDS!

	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS

	RIDLEY, standing guard, hears THE ALARM. He hears Chris

	JIGGLING the knob. But he sees NO DOOR. The walls around

	him seem to be solid slabs.

	Pg-24

	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS

	CHRIS can't get the doorknob to turn. Behind him, a dusty

	ORIENTAL CARPET BULGES upward. One corner flops aside.

	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS

	RIDLEY is spooked by the sound. Frightened, trembling,

	he un-slings his rifle.

				RIDLEY

			Who... who's there?

	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS

	CHRIS doesn't hear the trooper. Behind him, A Decomposed

	HAND pokes out of a drainage ditch beneath the carpet. It

	gropes. Finds purchase on the floor.

	Chris is unaware of the danger. He HURLS himself against

	the door. He can't break through.

	The thing that climbs out of the ditch was once a man, once

	a SCIENTIST. It's wearing a lab coat and a pair of thick

	EYEGLASSES. But it's long dead. It's... A ZOMBIE.

	As it pulls itself up, its eyeglasses strike the side of the

	ditch. They fall, CLATTERING, the rims scraping the zombie's

	cheek, which peels away like onion skin.

	Chris hears the noise. Turns and sees...

	...the dead man, reaching out hungrily.  Chris is trapped.

	He aims his Winchester. CLICK! He forgot. It's empty.

	The zombie pulls itself fully up onto the floor. Chris digs

	in his shoulder bag. Pulls out a handful of bullets and with

	them, accidentally, Jill's BERET. Rising emotion stops him

	for a moment.

	The dead man crawls toward him. Chris might not have time

	to load. As he tries to jam a bullet into his rifle, the

	zombie SWATS at him.  Catches the beret.  Looks at it.

	Sniffs it.  The bullet pops out of Chris' nervous fingers.

	He tries to load another.

	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS

	RIDLEY spots A BLUE ACCESS SLOT in the wall. He levels his

	automatic and CHEWS the thing up with a short burst.

	A PANEL SWINGS OPEN! CHRIS dives out... with the ZOMBIE

	inches behind him. Ridley FIRES off another BURST OF ROUNDS.

	Pg-25

	Stray bullets PIERCE the zombie's head. It drops back into

	the chamber...with Ridley never knowing why.

	Ridley and Chris look at each other, asking rapid-fire

	questions, none of them answered.

				RIDLEY

			Who are you?

				CHRIS

			Who are YOU? What the hell is 

			S.T.A.R.S.?

				RIDLEY

			How'd you get in here?

				CHRIS

			Who sealed the door?

				RIDLEY

			Who knew there a door?

	WHAM! ANOTHER ZOMBIE appears suddenly behind Ridley, BITING

	out the muscle between his shoulder and neck. The trooper

	stands, stunned, for a moment...

				RIDLEY

			Who... who... ?

	...then he drops..

	The zombie, in a uniform, once a security guard, gazes dully

	at Chris.  A wet sound comes from inside its gullet as it

	calmly chews on Ridley's flesh.  Swallowing, it reaches out.

	Chris grabs its arms, FLINGS it into the chamber. Then

	FIRES his Winchester, once, putting a HOLE in the thing's

	head. Chris slams the door.

	INT   MANSION   DINING ROOM   TIMELESS

	In a Hearst-sized dining room with draped furniture, WESKER

	and the OTHER TROOPERS have heard the new gunfire.

				SPEYER

			Where'd that come from?

				BARRY

			Back...where we just were.

				SPEYER

			Shit, man, we're chasin' our tails!

	Pg-26

	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS

	CHRIS hears the CLATTERING of the troopers heading his way.

	What he doesn't hear is... a slight CRACKLING... in the walls.

	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   TIMELESS

	WESKER and his TEAM burst into the corridor with the old-

	fashioned ELEVATOR.  FLASHLIGHTS find... the body of the

	ZOMBIE that was shot by Jill, bullet HOLES allover its body.

				SPEYER

			Damn. Surnbitch took a lotta lead.

				BARRY

			That's not what killed him. Blood's

			still running. Wounds are fresh.

			But look at his skin. This guy's

			been dead for a couple of days.

				RODRIGUEZ

			He was dead... before he was shot?

	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS

	CHRIS checks Ridley.  No pulse.  His own rustling movements

	prevent him from hearing... that soft CRACKLING SOUND.

	The kitchen is lined with fifty-year-old IVY-PATTERNED

	WALLPAPER.  The printed VINES seem to be MOVING!  Chris

	doesn't notice until the vines begin to WIGGLE furiously...

	and RIP THROUGH the paper.  They're REAL.  Sprouts from

	some sort of exotic plant, that have climbed up the walls...

	with INTELLIGENCE!  They seem aware of Chris' presence.

				REBECCA (O.S.)

			Ridley?

	REBECCA has appeared in an open doorway. Chris looks at her,

	with the tips of the vines beginning to brush his shoulders.

				REBECCA (cont.)

			Who... who are...

				CHRIS

			I... I'm one of the good guys, okay

			I'm just trying to...

				REBECCA

			(Calling) SULLIVAN! AIKEN!

				CHRIS

			Shit.

	Pg-27

	Chris, familiar with the room, opens a SMALL DOOR in the

	wall, barely man-sized, and almost invisible because it's

	covered in matching wallpaper. Chris dives in.

	AIKEN and SULLIVAN pop up behind Rebecca, having barely

	caught a glimpse of Chris.

				AIKEN

			Who was that?

				SULLIVAN

			Forget him. What are they?

	Sullivan points at the vines... which are swirling, groping,

	as if alive, making their way toward Ridley's body.

	INT  MANSION   CHUTE   TIMELESS

	In a LAUNDRY CHUTE, propping himself against the sides,

	CHRIS descends...down...down... as he did as a child...

	and comes out onto...

	INT   CRAWL SPACE   TIMELESS

	...a DROP-CEILING, newly installed. Iron frames support

	AIR-FILTRATION SYSTEMS and other heavy MACHINERY. Sheet-

	metal walls have replaced the old soffit and fascia. LIGHT,

	from somewhere below, knifes through gridded iron vents.

				CHRIS

			Somebody did some major remodeling.

	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS

	The VINES continue to advance.

				REBECCA

			We gotta get him out!

	THE TROOPERS rush to retrieve RIDLEY'S BODY. The VINES hover

	around them, occasionally DARTING, then pulling back, as if

	they were timid animals, hungry, but afraid of anew food-

	dish. When AIKEN brandishing his M-16, the VINES RECOIL and

	RETRACT fully... THWIP THWIP THWIP... behind the wallpaper and

	down... somewhere into the bowels of the house.

				AIKEN

			What? Smart fuckin' plants?

				SULLIVAN

			No big deal. Most-plants are

			smarter than you, Aiken.

	Pg-28

	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   TIMELESS

	THE OTHERS are still puzzling over the DOWNED ZOMBIE.

				SPEYER

			Why would anyone shoot a dead man?

				RODRIGUEZ

			Lemme guess. Maybe 'cause he was...

			walkin' around?

	Barry steps closer to the corpse, notes its collapsed skull.

				BARRY

			Head-shot. We were sprayin' those

			dogs outside... but think about it.

			Were any of 'em brought down without

			a head-shot.

	Wesker has been exploring the corridor. Stopping in front

	of the elevator, he shines his light into the car. We expect

	someone... or some-thing... to be lurking inside.

	An attack comes from the opposite direction. A FIGURE BURSTS-

	out of the shadows behind Weasker. Another Zombie?  No.  It's

	JILL! In a rage, she holds her pistol to Wesker's head.

				JILL

			I lost three me.  You killed them,

			Wesker. You did... and I did. Because

			I didn't know what to expect... because

			you... didn't tell me!

				WESKER

			(Calmly) Tell you what?

				JILL

			Anything! I wasn't told anything!

				WESKER

			Put down the gun.

	Instead, Jill CLICKS the hammer back.

				WESKER (cont.)

			Put down the gun.

				JILL

			Not until...

				WESKER

			RELEASE! THAT'S AN ORDER, SOLDIER!

	Jill blinks. Slowly, reluctantly, she lowers her gun.

	Pg-29

	Wesker turns... and recognizes her.

				WESKER (cont.)

			How... did you get in here?

				JILL

			(Sarcastic) How ya doin' , Valentine?

			Good to see ya. Glad you're still

			alive. Same here, colonel, I'm...

				WESKER

			How did you get in here?

				JILL

			(Exploding) The same way those fuckin'

			dogs got out! Through their pens!

			(Relaxing some) I... locked them off.

				WESKER

			Good thinking.

	A VOICE interrupts, from the end of the corridor.

				VOICE (o.s.)

			MAN DOWN!

	The voice is SULLIVAN'S. The troopers run to join him.

	Last to leave the corridor are Wesker and Jill. Wesker

	gestures gallantly.

				WESKER

			Ladies first.

				JILL

			Fuck you.

	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS

	The TROOPERS trickle into the kitchen to find... REBECCA,

	kneeling over RIDLEY'S CORPSE, examining the ragged bite

	on its neck.

				RODRIGUEZ

			Maybe... they're in the house.

			More of them dogs.

				REBECCA

			Diameter's too small. It... almost

			looks as if... it was done by a...

				JILL

			(Arriving) A human?

	Rebecca looks up. The two women make sisterly eye-contact.

	Pg-30

				REBECCA

			Yes, but... what kind of... human...

			would do something like this?

				AIKEN

			Not a vegetarian, that's for sure.

				SULLIVAN

			Aiken, you'd be better off...

				REBECCA

			There was a guy. Not part of the

			team. And there was... some kind

			of... plant... that seemed... alive.

				RODRIGUEZ

			Gimme a fuckin' break.

				AIKEN

			No shit. It disappeared... right

			into the wall.

	Rodriguez cringes when she finds a ragged hole in the wall-

	paper near where she's standing.

				WESKER

			I guess it's... time to spill it.

	WESKER pulls off his dark glasses for the first time.

				WESKER (cont.)

			I don't know... much more than I

			already told you.  I'll tell you

			the rest now.  The labs hare are...

			were...working on special apps for

			bio-eng1neered materials.

				RODRIGUEZ

			Speak English, hombre.

				WESKER

			Marcus has been experimenting with

			an artificial... man-made... virus.

			Coded...the 'T'-virus.  Financing

			came from a private corporation, you

			may have heard the name... Umbrella.

				JILL

			They're... multi-national. Huge.

				WESKER

			So huge that they have... connections...

			in high places.  That's why we're here.

	Pg-31

				BARRY

			This virus... it jumped, right?

				SPEYER

			Shit! We're all dead! We got the

			bug, and we're all dead!

				WESKER

			It's not airborne. It was spread...

			in the water supply. Lab animals

			and... the researchers themselves...

			passed it on... by...

				JILL

			By... biting.

	Wesker hangs his head. It's an affirmation.

				BARRY

			You catch this virus and... what?

				WESKER

			You die. But... not for long. The

			chemical...revives the brain, and...

				RODRIGUEZ

			You stand back up... and chew on

			the first guy you see.

				SPEYER

			Christ, this is like... Night of the

			Living Dead!

				BARRY

			Why, in the name of Jesus, would

			anybody wanna mess with shit...

			that does that shit?

				WESKER

			Victory, friend. Civilization has

			come a long way, but we still have...

			war.  Imagine... a soldier who can't

			die.  That... was the concept.

				JILL

			But the virus... jumped.

				WESKER

			Hopefully... if we got all the dogs...

			we've contained it.

				JILL

			Hopefully?  Jesus... why didn't you

			tell us?

	Pg-32

				WESKER

			By telling you NOW, I've put your

			lives in jeopardy. Nobody has this

			information. Except a few high-and-

			mightys. Me. And now, you.

	The troopers fall silent as all this sinks in.

				WESKER (cont.)

			We have to get Marcus out of here.

			He developed this thing. He's the

			only one who... understands it.

				REBECCA

			I don't know, this all sounds pretty

			shaky to me...

	With a lightning move, Wesker draws his pistol and...BLAM!

	FIRES... at Rebecca. She flinches. The bullet flies past

	her and SHATTERS the skull of RIDLEY, the dead trooper who,

	having stood up, was about to attack Rebecca from behind.

	Ridley drops... dead again.

				RODRIGUEZ

			Guess that proves it. A head-shot

			knocks 'em down.

	Rebecca turns and looks at the blood-splattered body.

				REBECCA

			Th-that man.. .was dead. (Freaking)

			I... I'm a doctor! I should know!

			That man was dead!

	Vickers reaches in Rebecca's bag, pulls out an ammonia

	capsule, cracks it, and holds it under her nose.

				VICKERS

			I hope you have a lot of these.

	INT   CRAWL-SPACE   TIMELESS

	CHRIS crawls across the drop-ceiling, into the up-rising

	light from one of the vents. He looks down through the

	grid work and sees...

	...the same LABORATORY that was behind Marcus in the opening

	video. No longer pristine, it's wrecked, torn apart. Files

	are scattered everywhere along with smashed fragments of

	furniture and computer hardware.

	CAGES that line the walls are filled with LAB ANIMALS making

	NERVOUS CHATTER. Chris watches a MONKEY sip water from a

	dish. Like the other animals, its skin is rotting.

	Pg-33

	Chris is about to move on, when his eye catches...

	...MOVEMENT... outside the cages.  There's A MAN, in a

	lab coat, sitting at a desk, writing on a note pad.

				CHRIS

			(Calling) Hey.

	CLOSE ON: the man's HAND... flaking, decomposing.  The pen

	it holds is making only random, erratic marks.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			HEY!

	The man turns his head, slowly, to look up toward the voice.

	There's NOTHING left of his FACE. RAW TISSUE seeps odd-

	colored fluids. A single eyeball is nested tenuously in

	the ooze. Something like a mouth, recognizable only because

	of its position, opens... and GROANS.

	Chris, pumping his Winchester, hears... KRANG! A NOISE from

	below. He looks down again, just as...

	...the lab door BURSTS open. WESKER and ALPHA TEAM stream

	into the lab. The thing with. the destroyed face turns toward

	the invaders, stands, and shuffles toward them.

	Without hesitation, Wesker, on point, FIRES a quick burst

	into the thing's brain. It drops like a sack. The lab

	animals SHRIEK.

	The team files in, not noticing... ANOTHER ZOMBIE... crawling

	across the floor...heading directly for SPEYER. Chris shouts

				CHRIS (cont. )

			HEADS UP!

	He punches out the grate with the barrels of his rifle

	and... BLAM!...punches a sure-fire HOLE in the zombie's head.

	BRAD VICKERS, his nerves badly frayed, thinks the team is

	being attacked. He SPRAYS the ceiling with his automatic.

	Chris ducks and rolls, narrowly escaping the initial barrage,

	but bullets keep coming, punching a dotted line up through

	the ceiling panels.

	Chris scrambles, as fast as he can, his feet barely escaping

	the punch holes.

	He finds himself on top of an enormous checkerboard of vents

	and Plexiglas panels. Bullets weaken the framework. It

	sags... then CRACKS, dropping away. Chris is plunged into...

	Pg-34

	INT   LAB   LEVEL "A" TIMELESS

	...WATER! CHRIS kicks, paddles with his rifle, righting

	himself, getting his bearings. He's in a huge AQUARIUM

	that's built into one of the laboratory's walls... and he's

	not alone. There are SIX SHARKS in the tank. ZOMBIE SHARKS,

	their flesh rotting, leaking pus.

	The largest of them SNAPS at Chris, but its jaws catch only

	a clump of his swirling hair. Chris kicks with his feet,

	remaining upright, and FIRES his wet Winchester.

	The bullet wimps-out, restrained by the water. It penetrates

	the shark, but barely. We can see the casing lodged in the

	animal's flesh.

	Chris gets an idea. He kicks forward. Plants the barrel

	of his Winchester directly against the aquarium glass...

	only to find himself aiming directly at...

	...JILL, who is aiming back at him with her M-16. They're

	both stunned. They stare at each other for a moment, like

	gunfighters, until...

	...another shark circles in for an attack. Chris swings the

	Winchester away from Jill and FIRES underwater. The aquarium

	glass CRACKS... but holds.

				JILL (cont.)

			Hang on! We're gonna get wet!

	Jill FIRES. More CRACKS, but the glass is resistant.

	Chris out. Water SURGES into the lab, knocking Wesker and

	some of his squad down.

	They stand up again, only to find themselves knee-high in a

	dark pool...with SHARK FINS slicing the surface. Everybody

	opens fire. The dead fish keep coming.

				AIKEN

			Where the fuck is a shark's brain?

				SULLIVAN

			In it's head! I swear, Aiken, you

			would be better off dead.

	In a bizarre frenzy, the sharks KICK their tails, making

	startlingly quick turns, darting every which way, SNAPPING

	at the scent of warm flesh. The troopers, hampered by the

	water, SPLASH around wildly, many of them nearly getting

	bitten. The air above thickens with a fog of graphite from

	ten spitting automatics.

	Pg-35

	The water gets darker as it becomes clouded with BLOOD. But

	thankfully, the level is dropping. The water is seeping out

	through GRATES in the floor. The sharks become more visible,

	moving slower as their bellies scrape the floor.

	The troopers pick them off, one by one. The immediate threat

	passes...but as the water drains away, the troopers become

	aware of... a KLAXON-LIKE SOUND. ANOTHER ALARM. The entry

	door glides shut with a BOOOMMM!

				WESKER

			Nice. Very NICE, Valentine! You

			set off a containment breach!

				JILL

			It must have been the water. God,

			the water! (She turns to Chris}

			Did you swallow any?

				SPEYER

			I did.

				SULLIVAN

			A bunch of us did, man.

				WESKER

			Separate systems. Salt water.

			No germs. But.. .it breached!

	Wesker, looking crazed, his sunglasses gone, is typing on

	his "Game-Boy"... getting no response.

				WESKER (cont.)

			We can go in deeper.  But we can't

			get out.  Not with my card-key.

				RODRIGUEZ

			So...we live here now.

	Rosie finds Sullivan looking at her curiously.

				RODRIGUEZ (cont.}

			Landlords. Shit hills. Kicked my

			family out of six apartments. I

			got use to sayin'...'So...we live

			here now'.

				WESKER

			There are override exits... but I

			can't find them without THIS!

	Wesker FLINGS his "Game-Boy" angrily against a wall. It

	shatters into bits.

	Pg-36

				CHRIS

			That was a smart move.

	Wesker bristles. He's about to confront Chris, but he spots

	his sunglasses where they were deposited on a floor grate by

	the water. He walks over and picks them up, wiping the

	lenses on his shirt. Without looking at Chris, he asks...

				WESKER

			And... you are?

				CHRIS

			Nobody.  Just a...a local guy...

	Chris spots a dry lab-coat hanging on a wall hook. He takes

	it down and uses it to dry his rifle.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			...who gets pissed-off when he finds...

			his farm animals... and his father's

			oldest friend... dead. And the only

			woman he ever cared about turns out

			to be a goddam METAL HEAD!

	Wesker, while seeming to understand, still doesn't look up.

				WESKER

			Valentine...who is this asshole?

				JILL

			His name is Chris Redfield. He was...

			part of my cover, sir.

				CHRIS

			Cover?

	A snappy argument develops, a lover's quarrel, with higher-

	than-normal stakes.

				JILL

			This is not the time to mouth off,

			Chris! You're in deep shit here!

				CHRIS

			Why didn't you let me in on this?

				JILL

			Why did you have to come after me?

			How did you get in here, anyway?

				CHRIS

			I used to play here, when this was

			a fucking laundry room!  And what

			makes you think I came after YOU?

	Pg-37

				BARRY

			(Interrupting) Whoa! Look here.

	Barry is stooped over the faceless zombie that Wesker shot.

	He rips an I.D. badge from the corpse's coat.  He tosses it

	to Wesker, who reads the I.D... "DR. J. MARCUS"

				BARRY (cont.)

			Is this the pile of shit we're

			supposed to bring out of here?

				WESKER

			It...it once was.

				VICKERS (o.s.)

			I got something here.

	BRAD has been quietly working at one of the lab's computers.

	Barry rushes over and looks at the monitor screen.

				BARRY

			A map. Same as on your gizmo. Exits

			marked...blue and green.

	Wesker steps in for a look.

				WESKER

			The greens are the overrides. (To

			Brad) Can you print this out?

				VICKERS

			I can try.

	Chris calmly retrieves his wet shoulder bag from the floor.

	He wrings out the cloth and, using the lab coat, wipes the

	bullets dry.

				VICKERS (cont.)

			(Off the screen) We're on level 'A'.

				WESKER

			We have to get down to level 'D'.

				BARRY

			Hold on. Marcus is dead. If this

			mission was about bringin' him out,

			we're outta here, right?

				WESKER

			I wish we were, but no. We have

			a potential outbreak here. We might

			be the only ones who can stop it.

	Pg-38

				SPEYER

			Stop it? How?

				WESKER

			There's... an antidote.

	Everyone's ears perk.

				WESKER (cont.)

			We can't bring Marcus out, but we

			can bring out the serum. Maybe

			somebody...can analyze it... and

			figure how to beat the virus.

	Jill looks at Chris. Catches him weighing options.

				JILL

			(Privately) Not simple.

				CHRIS

			(Privately) Not complicated, either.

			We only have to decide... what's right...

			and what's wrong.

				JILL

			(Privately) I forgot. You're never

			confused. So...what's right, Mohawk?

			And what's wrong?

				VICKERS

			Shit. (At the computer) There are

			no green exits on this level. Why...

			why would that be?

				CHRIS

			They don't want anybody up here

			to go snoopin' ...upstairs or down.

	Wesker looks at Chris with that odd, confident smile.

				WESKER

			Pretty good guess. You must have

			been in the military, son.

				CHRIS

			Native American. Exempted.

				VICKERS

			(Typing, starting to panic) Fuck!

			There... there's no way out!

				CHRIS

			Yes there is.

	Chris points at the broken grid above the shattered aquarium.

	Pg-39

	Wesker looks up. Then looks back at Chris.

				WESKER

			Not a bad idea. (Turning to

			Vickers) See if you can call

			up... service charts, schematics.

	Brad's fingers fly. He scrolls through menus.

				VICKERS

			Got it. Ceiling grids, ladders.

			The whole infrastructure.

				WESKER

			Print it. Print all of it.

	The young man types a command. Wesker rushes over to the

	H. P. and grabs the first chart that rolls out.

	Rebecca steps over to Brad. She points at his leg.  Seated

	at the computer, his trousers hiked, BLOOD can be seen on his

	sock, just above his boot.

				REBECCA

			What's that from?

				VICKERS

			(Nervous) I...snagged it. On the

			desk. When we were scrambling.

				REBECCA

			Lemme look at it.

				VICKERS

			(Adamant) No. It's just a scratch!

	Chris watches Wesker as he studies the printed charts.

				CHRIS

			There's a... part of an old laundry

			chute. It might not show on there.

			It runs up to the kitchen.

				WESKER

			I'm not going up. I'm going down.

	Wesker, grim-faced, looks at his team.

				WESKER (cont.)

			I'd like to let you guys off the

			hook. But I can't. I need back

			up. You're comin' with me. Any

			objections?

	The troopers exchange glances. Jill is first to speak.

	Pg-40

				JILL

			No objections. We'll back you up.

				CHRIS

			(Disappointed) You said... people

			wind you up and you do whatever

			they want you to do.

				WESKER

			Stay out of this, son. You're the

			only one who doesn't have a choice

			in this. There's no place to lock

			you up. I can't let you go, you're

			a security risk. I could shoot you.

			Legally. But your lady-friend would

			probably get all over my ass. So...

			I'm afraid you're comin' with us...

			whether you like it or not. (To Jill,

			pointedly) He's your responsibility,

			Valentine. See that he doesn't make

			trouble.

	Jill looks at Chris.

				CHRIS

			You up to the challenge?

				JILL

			Try me.

				CHRIS

			(Snappy) I already have.

	INT   CRAWL-SPACE   TIMELESS

	One by one, the members of ALPHA TEAM wiggle up into the

	crawl space above the ceiling. CHRIS climbs up behind JILL.

	OTHER TROOPERS are already away, following WESKER, who guides

	them with the help of his chart. Jill starts after them.

	Chris grabs her arm.

				CHRIS

			Jill, I... I'm sorry. I'm just...

			angry. When I... thought you were

			gone, I... Then... when I saw you.

			Alive. I realized that...

				JILL

			That you were still... fascinated.

				CHRIS

			Stop. Stop!

	He pulls her into an embrace. She goes willingly.

	Pg-41

				CHRIS (cont.)

			Come with me. We can get out of here.

				JILL

			(Tempted) I...I want to. I want...

			nothing more. But... I can't. When

			I'm in this uniform, I'm more than...

			just me. Try to understand...there's

			no "I" in Team, Chris.

				CHRIS

			There's no "I" in DEAD, either.

	Chris pulls away from the embrace and looks at her.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			I should order you to come with me.

			You'd never refuse an order.

				JILL

			You go. You're not part of this.

				CHRIS

			I'm part of it as. long as you are.

				BARRY (o.s.)

				This is very uncomfortable.

	Barry, having overheard, is halfway up through the grate.

				CHRIS

			For me, too, brother.

				BARRY

			I mean this... (indicating the

			iron that's pressing his belly.)

			It's very uncomfortable.

	Chris and Jill help Barry up into the crawl space.

	start off after the troop. THE CAMERA TRACKS them.

				BARRY (cont.)

			This is gettin' old, Man, I swear.

			I been in this Army eighteen years.

				CHRIS

			Eighteen years?

				BARRY

			Yep. Two away from the big re-ti.

				JILL

			Desk job, right? Nobody lasts that

			long if they've seen action.

	Pg-42

				BARRY

			I've seen action in Granada.  And

			Desert Storm.  Would have lost it

			all there... if my buddy didn't bring

			in a team, against orders, to pull

			my ass out.  Buddy named... Wesker.

				CHRIS

			You've been with this asshole since... ?

				BARRY

			Since before that.  We were... kids

			together.  Macon, Georgia.  He's...

			only an asshole some of the time...

	UP AHEAD : WESKER reaches a service ladder. He waves his

	troop on. They start to climb down.

				VICKERS

			Who knows what we'll find down there?

				AIKEN

			Think positive.  The farther down we

			go, the worse it's gonna get.  So...

			until we hit bottom, we're in good

			shape... relatively speaking.

	GRRRAAAAWWWLr.! Distant... but distinct... it sounds like

	the MGM lion.

				SPEYER

			What the fuck?

	Again .GRRRRRAAAAAWWWWLLLL !

				VICKERS

			Whatever it is.. .it can't get us.

			We're in the ceiling!

				AIKEN

			Maybe it's like... really tall.

				SULLIVAN

			Aiken...

	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS

	The lead TROOPERS reach another section of the ceiling.

	Clustering around a vent, they look down into...

	...the "B"-level lab, more streamlined, more high-tech than

	the one upstairs. There are large COMPUTERS, linked by

	metal-shielded conduits to jacks in the walls.

	Pg-43

				WESKER

			Main-frame. Might have some data

			we could use. (A quick decision)

			Fox, Marini, Vickers.  Down.

	WESKER kicks out the vent. He jumps first, through the

	opening, down into the lab. CHRIS watches from behind.

				CHRIS

			The man has balls, I'll say that.

	Wesker grabs a desk and pushes it under the vent.  MARINI

	climbs down, followed by FOX.  BRAD is last.

				WESKER

			Hustle it, Vickers.  You're the guy

			we need.  To cut into the network.

	INT   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS

	WESKER looks around. There are THREE Doorways...open wide

	with only darkness beyond. Wesker runs around closing them.

				WESKER

			Watch these entrances, guys.

	FOX and MARINI take up posts. Brad lowers himself gingerly.

	He drops the last two feet onto the desk, landing on his

	bloody leg.

				VICKERS

			AAAAH ! Shit.

	He topples, falling to the floor, but pops up instantly.

				VICKERS (cont. )

			I'm alright. I'm alright.

	He limps over and attacks the computer keys.

	GRRRRRAAAAAWWWWWLLLL! Another distant snarl.

				WESKER

			Hold tight. It doesn't sound like

			it's on this level.

				VICKERS

			(At the computer) Shit. I'm locked

			out. Any clues for a password?

				WESKER

			Try... Umbrella.

	Brad types rapidly, nervously. Flubs. Types again.

	Pg-44

				VICKERS

			Nothing. Wait. I'm into... No.

			No data. Just some kind of video

			feed. Time-coded. Yesterday.

			It's a play-back. (Watching the

			screen) Holy shit!

	We HEAR it before we see it. The sound of absolute PANIC.

	People SHOUTING! SCREAMING! THUDS and CRASHES! GLASS

	BREAKING! Then A WOMAN'S VOICE .

				WOMAN'S VOICE (o.s.)

			Please...please.. .if anyone is

			receiving this...

	Brad limps around the desk and spins the monitor for the

	others to see. The WOMAN is an ORIENTAL. She's standing

	in the foreground, as Marcus was in the opening video.

	Behind her is a lab we haven't seen yet... with white-

	coated FIGURES... RUNNING... FIRING GUNS.

				WOMAN (cont.)

			the situation is completely.

			out of control. We...

	W

	HAM ! The woman is pushed out of the way by A MAN who is

	trying to protect her from...

	...SOMETHING that BLURS past the lens, like a pendulum,

	from ABOVE.

	In the next instant... SPLAT... the lens is COATED WITH BLOOD!

	As it oozes down, we see a partial image of the same MAN.

	His HEAD is OUT OF FRAME at the top of the screen.

	The thing above must have a hold on it... because the man is

	DANGLING, his arms witching. His back has three GOUGES in

	it, long and so deep that they might have been made by

	piece of heavy machinery. We only see this for an instant...

	before the man is LIFTED, straight UP, with amazing SPEED.

	Wesker clicks off the monitor. The other men instinctively

	look up above their heads.

				FOX

			Maybe the ceiling's not such a

			safe place, after all.

	CRASH! The door behind Fox BURSTS open. Before he has

	time to react A ZOMBIE is on him, BITING his cheek, neck,

	shoulder. The two figures fall to the floor, grappling.

	Wesker can't get a clean shot.

				WESKER

			Scram! SCRAM!

	Pg-45

	Marini is first to reach the desk, but he helps the limping

	Brad up ahead of him. TWO MORE ZOMBIES lurch in through the

	open doorway. Wesker shoots them, but he sees MORE... can't

	tell how many...shambling toward the open doorway from the

	darkness beyond.

	Wesker focuses on Fox, who is still being MAULED, BITTEN.

	Fox SCREAMS. Wesker still has no safe shot.

	Brad is YANKED up into ceiling by SULLIVAN and AIKEN. CHRIS

	leans out of the opening, reaching for Marini.

	Wesker KICKS the mauling zombie in the head. It takes three

	hard BOOTS to attract the thing's attention. When it finally

	looks up at him, Wesker BLOWS out its skull.

	Fox is lying on his stomach, writhing, BLEEDING profusely

	from a half-dozen bites. Wesker stoops down, trying to roll

	him over, lift him up. Fox resists. He's gone insane.

	Chris pulls Marini up to safety. BARRY leans down through

	the opening.

				BARRY

			Haul ass, boss!

	The zombies are heading for Wesker. There are three of them.

	Barry shoots at the one in front. Misses. His second shot

	hits the thing's brain.

	Wesker again tries to hoist Fox who, this time rolls over on

	his own. He has drawn his pistol. Before Wesker can stop

	him, he eats the barrel and BLOWS out the back of his head.

	One zombie is dangerously close. Barry fires two more

	rounds. No head shot, but the zombie staggers and, though

	not dead, FALLS...directly toward Wesker. The colonel rolls

	on his back, kicking himself away, managing to get clear.

	He uses his own pistol to BLAST the zombie.

	He scrambles to his feet, darts toward the desk, and jumps

	up. The third zombie grabs his legs. From above, Barry

	risks a dangerous shot. BLAM! Wesker hears the bullet

	WHIZZZ past his head like a mosquito.

	The zombie is hit in the skull. It drops. There are MORE

	of them coming out of the darkness. Barry takes hold of

	Wesker and, with a single strong arm, pulls him up into...

	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS

	...the crawl space, where WESKER breathes heavily for a

	moment... then looks up at his old friend.

	Pg-46

				WESKER

			That's...two I owe ya.

				BARRY

			One. We were all... 'Even-Steven' .

				WESKER

			Two. Remember? 'Even-Steven' ...

			is not in my vocabulary.

	A horrible MOANING SOUND comes from below, in the lab.

	THREE MORE ZOMBIES can be seen clustering around the desk,

	dumbly trying to climb up, sensing the "food" above.

				WESKER (cont.)

			Let's move.

	Wesker takes off. SPEYER, RODRIGUEZ, AIKEN and SULLIVAN are

	quick to follow. The others lag behind when CHRIS says...

				CHRIS

			Those things could get up here.

			We can't let that happen. This

			is our way out...

	Chris swings his legs through the grate and JUMPS down...

	INT   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS

	...ONTO THE DESK. He BOOTS one of the ZOMBIES away and

	tries to LEAP over the others. One of them catches his foot

	in mid air. CHRIS isn't hurt, but he TOPPLES to the floor,

	sprawling, losing his Winchester.

	The zombies have him cornered. He crawls toward his rifle.

	Reaches it. Pumps a shell into the firing chamber. Aims

	at the closest of the walking dead...

	...which was once a young man, a simple laborer, wearing

	overalls, with a name tag...

				CHRIS

			(Reading) Caruso.

	Chris looks empathetically into the thing's dead eyes.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			Can you hear me?

	The zombie lumbers forward hungrily.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			Caruso! Can you hear me?

	Pg-47

	Chris has come late to the realization that these things

	were once human. Now he comes late to the realization...

	that they are human no longer.

	The zombie grabs the barrel of the Winchester, pushing it

	aside. Chris can't bring it back to bear on the monster's

	head. He BLASTS a round through the thing's belly. It has

	no effect. The zombie reaches for Chris' throat. Starts to

	lean in to bite him.

	BLAM! The thing's skull explodes. JILL has jumped down

	onto the desk. She FIRES another accurate pistol round.

	The SECOND ZOMBIE falls.

	Jill leaps to the floor and starts to push the desk. Chris

	gets to his feet, rushing in to help her. Together, they

	shove the desk out from under the open ceiling grate.

				CHRIS

			Thank you.

				JILL

			Any time. How do we get back UP?

				CHRIS

			Shit, if you didn't have a plan, you

			shouldn't have jumped down here.

				JILL

			We have a real problem here, Chris.

	Jill nods toward the open doorway. There are more stuttering

	FIGURES approaching out of the dark.

				CHRIS

			How big is this place? How many

			people were down here? How...

				JILL

			HOW DO WE GET UP?

	With a startling SOUND, A DARK SHAPE swing down from above

	and GRABS Jill! Is it the thing we saw on the video?

	No. It's BARRY! His mighty arms lift Jill. She's caught

	by Aiken and Sullivan and pulled up to safety. Barry grabs

	Chris and lifts him as well.

	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS

	CHRIS grabs the edge of the grate and pulls himself up.

	He reaches back down through the opening. Below, BARRY

	squats... and makes a mighty leap-with his muscular legs.

	Chris grabs his arms... and is nearly pulled back down.

	Pg-48

				CHRIS

			(Straining) Big. Heavy.

	Jill grabs on, then Sullivan. But one of the ZOMBIES has

	reached Barry. It GRABS his kicking legs. It's TEETH SNAP!

	And CATCH! The commandos lift Barry clear, but the zombie

	ends up with a CHUNK of something in its mouth.

				JILL

			It got you!

	Barry checks his leg. His trousers are torn, but...

				BARRY

			No skin broken. I'm alright.

				CHRIS

			We owe you a pair of pants.

	They crawl away. The zombies below reach up, their fingers

	clutching, at the ceiling, but with the desk gone, there's

	no way they can get up.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT   STORAGE AREA   TIMELESS

	THE COMMANDOS climb down a steel access ladder into a storage

	room stacked with CRATES and CARTONS. There's only one door.

	The place seems secure.

				WESKER

			Stand down. Five minutes.

	WESKER sits on a crate and pulls out his printed charts.

	Gradually the whole troop makes it down into the room.

	They relax. A few light cigarettes. But not SPEYER.

				SPEYER

			I'm through, Wesker.

				MARINI

			Me too, man. This ain't nothin'

			I signed on for.

				WESKER

			(Calm) You want to wait here, fine.

				MARINI

			Wait here? No. We're gettin' out!

				WESKER

			You can't. (He flashes his access

			card.) Not without this.

	Pg-49

				SPEYER

			Fuck you! And your fancy doors and

			your green key! The choppers have

			rockets. They can blow out a wall

			if they have to. I'm callin' 'em in.

	Speyer pulls out his radio and starts to punch a code.

				WESKER

			You wanna see a wall blow, I'll

			blow all of 'em for ya.

	Wesker reaches down to the electronic unit that he lost and

	retrieved in the woods. He pulls a long wire out of it, with

	a small sensor on the end.

				WESKER (cont.)

			I'll put a crater in this forest that

			takes out Racoon City and everything

			else for twenty miles... with this.

	He jams the little sensor into his ear and pushes a button

	on the belt unit. Small red LIGHTS blink.

				WESKER (cont.)

			It's a radio detonator...to set off

			explosives that are...buried under

			neath us somewhere. The ultimate

			containment measure. Incinerate the

			place. (Smiling again) It has a...

			dead-man mechanism... .(he taps the

			ear-piece) ...that reads my pulse.

			My heart stops, and... boom.

				CHRIS

			You...lunatic! That damn thing can

			slip out of your ear by accident!

				WESKER

			That's right. It's your job...all

			of your jobs...to see that it doesn't.

			And to see that my heart... doesn't

			skip any beats.

	Wesker looks over the tops of his sunglasses... at Speyer

				WESKER (cont.)

			Give me the radio, soldier.

	Speyer hesitates. Wesker explodes, for the first time.

				WESKER (cont.)

			GIMME THE FUCKIN' RADIO, OR WE

			ALL GO UP!

	Shocked silence. Sullivan is the first to speak.

				SULLIVAN

			Sumbitch might do it, Speyer.

				WESKER

			I'II be obliged to do it! If I don't

			get that antidote, I'll have to burn

			this place out! (Beat) Valentine.

			The radio.

	Jill steps over to Speyer and takes the radio from him.

				CHRIS

			(To Jill) What are you, this guy's

			flunky? He just threatened to blow

			us all up, for Christ's sake!

				JILL

			That's what I'm trying to prevent!

	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   IN THE AIR   DAY

	WHAP WHAP WHAP... one HUEY is in the air..., THE CAMERA MOVES IN

	on a window. LAGUARDIA is flying, his RADIO MAN beside him.

				LAGUARDIA

			How many digits did you receive?

				RADIO MAN

			Six. The beginning of an air-

			support code, but... it just went

			dead on me.

				LAGUARDIA

			Call S.T.A.R.S. in Washington.

			I want...

				RADIO MAN

			Hold it...

	The radio man presses his headset to his ear. LaGuardia

	looks on apprehensively.

				RADIO MAN (cont.)

			It's Wesker. (Into mike) Yes, sir.

			We got the signal sir. (He clicks

			off) He says it was... a mistake.

				LAGUARDIA

			Call Washington anyway. I want

			the authority to take action if

			necessary.

	Pg-51

	INT   OFFICE   TIMELESS

	BRRRING! The hand with the ostentatious RING snatches a red

	telephone receiver from of a desk drawer.

				MAN WITH RING (o.s.)

			Holden.

	He listens. Once again, we don't see his face. Just his

	free hand, with another Monte Cristo burning.

				HOLDEN (Man with ring, cont.)

			Denied. This is Wesker's show.

			If he was in real trouble, we'd

			have lost half of Pennsylvania

			by now.

	As the hand flicks ash, we see a sheet of paper on the desk

	with a letterhead that bears... an UMBRELLA LOGO.

				HOLDEN (cont.)

			No authorization.

	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   IN THE AIR   DAY

	In the HUEY, the RADIO MAN clicks off an incoming call.

				RADIO MAN

			No independent action.

				LAGUARDIA

			Damn. I feel so fuckin'... helpless!

	The huey over flies THE MANSION which, from the air, looks as

	stable as the Rock of Gibraltar.

	INT   STORAGE AREA   TIMELESS

	WESKER has come down off his rampage. He looks exhausted.

	He also looks staunchly heroic as he speaks to his TROOP.

				WESKER

			You guys were hand-picked. A Special

			Unit. Most of you have been sitting

			on your asses, drawing pay checks for

			more than two years. Well... it's time

			to repay those... Government loans.

				SPEYER

			Bull shit. I'm not...

	Wesker lifts his automatic. Speyer flinches. The action

	wasn't meant as a threat. Wesker is just checking his ammo.

	Pg-52

				WESKER

			Pitch your empties. Put all your

			loaded clips on that crate there.

			I want a count. Then I want the

			rounds divvied up... evenly.

	The troopers deposit their loaded clips, reloading the ones

	that are half-used.

				WESKER (cont.)

			Alright. We're on.. .(checking the

			maps) ...level "C"...

				AIKEN

			Lingerie. Notions.

				WESKER

			GOD DAMMIT, NO MORE JOKES! We have

			men dead upstairs! This hell-hole

			is full of people who died... because

			of this stinkin' ...BUG!

	Jill has been counting the ammo clips.

				JILL

			Forty two.

				SPEYER

			That's all we have?

				WESKER

			We weren't expecting a war, Speyer.

			(To Jill) I'll take three. Three

			to your boyfriend...

				CHRIS

			Don't need 'em. Got my own loads.

	Wesker's eyes dart angrily toward Chris. But he notices

	Jill watching him...and he calms himself.

				WESKER

			Good. Then... we all get four clips.

				SPEYER

			They must have... weapons down here,

			somewhere. A powder magazine.

				WESKER

			No more side trips. It was a mistake

			to go into that lab upstairs. My

			mistake. And I'm not makin' another

			one. From now on it's straight ahead.

			In and out.

	Pg-53

	Wesker stands and opens the door.  Outside is a SERVICE

	CORRIDOR with unfinished walls. Spaces between raw metal

	beams are stuffed with insulation. Wesker checks the jamb

	outside. It's got a lock mechanism. Blue.

				WESKER (cont.)

			Not an override. My key won't work

			here on the way out. Prop the door.

	The troopers drag a heavy crate over to hold the door open.

	Wesker moves out. The commandos trickle after him. Chris

	holds Jill behind for a moment.

				CHRIS

			Jill...this guy is a Loony-Toon.

				JILL

			He's just... trying to get the job

			done. Doing what he has to do.

				CHRIS

			Yeah, well...I hope you'll say

			the same about me... when I do...

			what I have to do.

	Chris turns and walks off. Jill follows him out into...

	INT   SERVICE CORRIDOR   TIMELESS

	...the corridor. They catch up with the TROOP which is

	clustered at a blind alley which has two doors.

				WESKER

			(Checking his map) It's not clear...

			which way to go.

				RODRIGUEZ

			Want me to flip a coin?

	WESKER is annoyed by the remark. Decisively, he selects one

	of the doors and uses his green key card. With a BZZZZ, the

	lock releases. The troop enters...

	INT   SYSTEMS CENTER   TIMELESS

	...a vast ROOM, fifty-by-fifty yards. It's filled with

	HEATERS, AIR CONDITIONERS, WATER PUMPS. MAIN FRAMES for

	the internal computer network line one wall, FUSE BOXES

	and SWITCHER PANELS another. This is the systems center

	for the entire facility.

	There's an attendant's desk just inside the door. AIKEN

	and SULLIVAN drag it over to prop the door open. It makes

	Pg-54

	a frightening SOUND as it scrapes the floor, echoing,

	bouncing around in the large space. It prompts a response...

	another of those animal-like SNARLS from somewhere in the

	distance.

				SULLIVAN

			What's that sound like to you?

				AlKEN

			A meat-eater.

	There are thick columns, floor to ceiling, every ten feet.

	The spaces between them are very dark. It's hard to see.

	WESKER and some of the OTHERS click on their FLASHLIGHTS .

	Beams cut through dust.

	There are ELECTRONIC HUMS.. CLICKS and CHATTERS emit from

	the switchers, PINGS from the heaters, all combining to fray

	everyone's nerves. Light beams dance nervously as the

	commandos start out across the dark and frightening space.

				CHRIS

			(Softly to Jill) This is the heart

			of the whole place. They've got to

			have it... protected somehow.

	Two things happen, almost at once. First.. .CHRIS notices

	ELECTRIC EYES... on all of the columns.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			DUCK! HIT THE DECK!

	Second. A ZOMBIE lurches around a corner and BITES a chunk

	out of MARINI'S face. JILL whirls around to shoot at the

	zombie, but Chris grabs her and FLATTENS her on the floor.

	Marini, staggering, screaming in pain, triggers the first

	electric eye. LASER BEAMS shoot in all directions, forming

	a tight NET. Chris and Jill are barely beneath them.

	Many of the other troopers are hit by the beams... which do

	no immediate harm... but wherever they make contact, small

	CYLINDERS above the electric eyes begin to HISS.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			FOR CHRISSAKE, GET DOWN!

	The commandos duck under the laser beams... just in time.

	Jets of STEAM spout from the cylinders. It's not just hot

	steam. It's ACIDIC, deadly.

	Marini is hit by it. His clothes IGNITE. His flesh BOILS.

	It's a horrible sight, but for the moment, the jets stop.

	Pg-55

	Marini is dead on his feet. When he falls, he trips another

	of the laser beams. The steam jets SPOUT again. The troop

	is beneath them, though many are burned by liquid drops that

	spit from the nozzles.

	Amazingly, the zombie has avoided contact. But as it begins

	to stumble after commandos, we realize it's going to activate

	the sensors again.

				SULLIVAN

			There's no way outta this mousetrap!

				RODRIGUEZ

			So we live here now?

				SPEYER

			We gotta run for it.

	The zombie hits one of the laser beams. The steam HISSES

	out again. The zombie is MELTED.

				AIKEN

			Bad idea, Speyer.

				CHRIS

			Down. Through these.

	Chris has noticed a series of hinged panels in the floor.

				VICKERS

			Where do they go?

				SULLIVAN

			Does it matter?

	Sullivan whips out a Swiss Army knife and goes to work on

	the screws that hold down one of the panels. Other troopers

	do the same.

	Another ZOMBIE lurches out of the darkness. And ANOTHER.

	Human hands work furiously, loosening screws. Panels come

	up, Troopers begin to duck through the openings.

	A second zombie hits a red beam. STEAM again. Chris and

	Jill are spattered. Burned. But Jill bravely keeps working

	with her own issued knife. She gets a panel open. As she

	drops through, a third zombie triggers a burst of steam.

	Chris ducks and covers.

	When the jets stop, Chris begins to climb into the opening,

	but one of his legs is GRABBED from behind by...

	...one of the dead things which has already been MELTED!

	Pg-56

	Its flesh is bubbling. Bone is beginning to show. But

	the acid hasn't reached its brain yet. The creature is

	still alive.

	Chris CRIES out. Acid from the zombie's hands is burning

	his leg. The thing's lips have been eaten away, making its

	teeth look frighteningly skeletal as it leans forward for a

	bite of flesh. Chris jams the stock of his Winchester into

	the zombie's mouth. He's able to hold the thing's head back,

	but he's stuck. He can't let go.

	Jill pops up out of the floor. She presses the barrel of her

	own weapon into the zombie's forehead.

				JILL

			On three...

				CHRIS

			One... two...

	Chris pulls his rifle away. At the same instant, Jill FIRES.

	The zombie is PROPELLED through the air. One of its flailing

	arms triggers another laser beam. Chris throws himself in on

	top of Jill as STEAM HISSES over them.

	Twenty yards away, Wesker crawls under the cloud of acid.

	Just as he climbs down through one of the openings, he feels

	pressure...on his ear.

	A groping zombie has accidentally hooked its fingers onto the

	wire that runs from the detonator to Wesker's ear-piece.

	For a breathless moment, it seems like the sensor will be

	popped loose. Holding the pulse-reader in place, Wesker

	twists his body, lifts his hand gun, and PUMPS THREE into

	the dead thing's brain.

	The zombie flops over, but its fingers cling, entangled, in

	the wire. Wesker plants his pistol barrel on the knuckles

	of the thing's dead hand. THREE MORE SHOTS cut through bone,

	removing the fingers from the hand. The wire is freed.

	Wesker dives into the opening in the floor.

	INT   AIR DUCT   TIMELESS

	The COMMANDOS find themselves in an AIR DUCT. No room to

	stand. Hardly room to sit.

	Chris looks at his rifle stock. It's corroded from the acid

	in the zombie's mouth. Jill notices.

				JILL

			God...and it doesn't even stop them...

	Pg-57

				CHRIS

			It's not meant to stop them. It's

			meant to stop...something else.

	That distant SNARLING SOUND comes again, making Jill shiver.

	The troop is strung out along the metal shaft. REBECCA

	crawls among them, treating the worst burns. WESKER checks

	his maps. SPEYER confronts him again.

				SPEYER

			We damn near got turned into Rice

			Krispies by that gizmo of yours.

			If you don't want me to nail that

			fuckin' thing into your ear, you

			deactivate it. Right now.

				WESKER

			I can't. They.. .fixed it... so you

			can't chicken out. The system can

			only be turned off at the main panel.

				BARRY

			Where the hell is that?

				WESKER

			Where the explosives are. Down...

			farther than we need to go. We only

			have to make it down one more level.

			If... when... we make it back up to

			the choppers... we can fly out of

			the detonator's signal range.

	Chris calls out from the far end of the shaft

				CHRIS

			I'm not willing to rely on that.

			I live here, this is my town!

				WESKER

			The town's been evacuated. Just...

			just in case.

				CHRIS

			That explains the lie. About the

			plane crash. An airplane down...

			with weapons on board... would nicely

			explain a big explosion, wouldn't it?

			You figured all along you might have

			to blow this place!

				WESKER

			I don't want to do it. I... I hope

			I don't have to.

	Pg-58

	Chris looks down the dim air-shaft, unable to see Wesker's

	eyes, hidden by distance.. .and by his dark glasses.

				WESKER (cont.)

			That's the best I can do for you,

			kid. Good faith. Now... let's

			knock on it.

	Wesker moves out. The troop follows.

				CHRIS

			I...I can't let this happen. I've

			got to find that bomb.

				JILL

			I'll help. Once Wesker gets what

			he wants, my obligation is over.

	Chris looks at her with appreciative eyes .

				CHRIS

			No. I want you out. With the

			rest of them. Wesker won't push

			the button until you're clear.

				JILL

			He doesn't want to push the button.

				CHRIS

			He has to. Don't you see? He can't

			leave these labs here. And, Jesus...

			walking corpses! He's gotta get rid

			of the evidence.

	INT   AIR SHAFT   TIMELESS

	The light is dim at its best. Long stretches of the shaft

	are pitch black, and there's a constant stream of air that

	MOANS eerily. This whole mission has been like a descent

	into Hell, darker and more frightening with each level down.

	There are turn-offs, "T"s and "Y"s. At one point, when JILL

	looks back, she finds ROSIE behind her. Chris is gone. Did

	he leave to deal with the bomb?

	No, but he's about to. He's at the rear of the pack, pressed

	against the side-wall, waving others past.

				JILL

			Chris, no!

				CHRIS

			I've got to try and stop this.

	Pg-59

	Jill starts back toward Chris, but freezes.. .everyone freezes

	when... the duct-work starts to PING.

				RODRIGUEZ

			Shit. One thing after another.

	BOOM! The air shaft is ROCKED, as if punched by a giant

	fist. Then...the whole structure begins to SHIMMY. What

	is it, an earthquake?

				WESKER

			Sit tight. Ride it out.

	GRONK! A sheet-metal panel BUCKLES! Others do the same.

	All along the shaft, panels begin to FOLD INWARD. Something

	outside is CRUSHING the duct as if it were a giant tube of

	toothpaste. And the troopers are being SQUEEZED inside.

	RIVETS POP! The panels begin to SEPARATE...and large,

	pulsing bits of FLESH appear! Not animal flesh. But the

	flesh of A PLANT! The things that press in through the

	openings are larger versions of the vines we saw in the

	kitchen. Those were its fingertips. These are its ARMS.

	Strong arms that are RIPPING the ductwork apart.

	Chris, Rebecca, Aiken and Sullivan end up in one part of the

	shaft. The rest in another... including Jill, who calls out.

				JILL

			CHRIS!

	The section that holds Chris' group FALLS AWAY... with a

	monstrous, CRUNCHING sound.

	INT   ARBORETUM   TIMELESS

	CHRIS' GROUP spills out of the dangling metal, with cables

	from the torn ceiling...TZZZZZT...SPARKING around them.

	The troopers drop out of Hell, into...PARADISE.

	An enormous HOT HOUSE, a lush, indoor JUNGLE of PLANTS,

	IVIES, GRASSES. It's like a RAIN FOREST, complete with

	a thick, damp MIST that makes it difficult to see. We might

	be on another planet. None of the foliage seems indigenous

	to Earth. There are LEAVES the size of bed sheets, FLOWERS ,

	the size of armchairs. And at the center of it all, is the

	mother of the deadly vines...

	...PLANT 42, a monstrous schefflera, twenty times normal

	size. Most of its limbs reach upward, where they have opened

	CRACKS in the ceiling and walls, to stretch on into the

	facility above. There are also dozens of shorter, beefier

	"arms", each of which act independently, like tentacles on

	an octopus... and each has a large, drooling POD at its tip.

	Pg-60

	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS

	BURSTS OF GUNFIRE from three M-16s shatter our ears... and

	a ceiling VENT. WESKER and THE OTHERS jump down into...

	...a very unusual CORRIDOR. It seems to stretch forever, in

	both directions. It has no doors, no visible means of exit

	or entry. The walls are made-up of multi-colored polymer

	TILES, whose irregular shapes fit together like a JIGSAW

	PUZZLE. The floor is HEAVY STEEL, though faceted. It seem

	designed to shift. The whole corridor looks like it might be

	able to bend, to change position, like an airport jet way.

	There are disconcerting signs of damage...claw-like GOUGES on

	the tiles, clean cut HOLES punched through the metal ceiling,

	larger in diameter than any that might have been caused by

	bullets.

	And there are smears of BLOOD everywhere, as if some terrible

	battle... or battles...took place here.

				WESKER

			This way. (He starts off.)

				JILL

			No. That way.  Chris and the others...

				WESKER

			If they're dead, they're dead. If

			they're alive, they'll still be alive

			in twenty minutes. When we get back.

				JILL

			Maybe not. And how do we know it's

			only going to be twenty minutes?

			How do we know we'll be able to come

			back this way?

				WESKER

			We don't. But we'll do our damndest

			to try. This is it, guys. The home

			stretch. Let's go.

	Wesker trots off. Vickers and Rodriguez follow. Speyer and

	Barry hang back... with Jill, who remains torn.

				WESKER (cont.)

			(Looking back) Valentine. You're

			on the clock! Fall in!

	Jill wrestles with her emotions but, in the end, dutifully,

	she "falls in".

	As the troopers move off, we hear odd SCRATCHING SOUNDS...

	with the high-pitched SQUEAL of metal-on-metal.

	Pg-61

	INT   ARBORETUM  TIMELESS

	The beefy "ARMS" of PLANT 42 undulate overhead as CHRIS and

	his COMPANIONS look for an exit.

				REBECCA

			Th-this thing was no accident.

			It was cultivated!

				CHRIS

			And it didn't rip out the ceiling

			for the fun of it. Stay alert.

	The plant seems to behave intelligently, with caution. The

	pods on its "arms" dart, almost as if sniffing... then pull

	back...like the vines in the kitchen, like timid animals.

	Chris spots A DOORWAY.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			Here.

	As the others follow him, one of the pods swoops down in

	front of REBECCA, and doesn't withdraw. It hovers there.

	Its follicle's open like jaws, which display serrated daggers

	of cartilage that look like teeth. Inside, a pulsing calyx

	emits a pistil that twitches and swells.

				AIKEN

			My mother made me eat vegetables.

			I know 'em all. This ain't one

			of 'em.

				SULLIVAN

			Aiken...

	ANOTHER POD swoops down on Sullivan's back. Its BEAK clamps

	onto the flesh between his shoulder blades. It's PISTIL

	shoots out like a hypodermic needle, stabs him and, within

	the blink of an eye, SUCKS out every ounce of the man's

	blood. His skin turns the color of PARCHMENT, FLAKING OFF

	HIM like powder, as he dies.

				AIKEN

			Sullivan! JESUS, SULLIVAN!

	Aiken rushes to his buddy's side.

				CHRIS

			Get out of the away!

	Chris launches himself off a stone retaining wall around one

	of the gardens. Leaping up, he grabs one of the SPARKING

	CONDUITS and pulls it down.

	Pg-62

				CHRIS (cont.)

			Get OUTA THERE, AIKEN!

	Chris ends up having to shoulder Aiken out of the way.

	Tendrils from the plant very nearly get both of them, but

	Chris manages to JAM the semi-rigid conduit into a pool of

	sprinkler-fed WATER around the plant's roots.

	A BRIGHT CURRENT stutters through every vine. The plant

	SHRIEKS, hideously, as electricity causes fluids to SQUIRT

	from boils that develop on its flesh, down along its "arms",

	and into its blood-sucking pods...which FLOP, lifeless, to

	the floor, with the same sort of liquid SMACKS that human

	skulls might make.

				AIKEN

			They.. .they killed Sullivan. The

			bastards... whoever did this shit...

			they KILLED SULLIVAN!

	Enraged, Aiken draws a long-bladed KNIFE and wildly attacks

	the remains of Plant 42, slashing at the thing's dead limbs,

	not stopping until he cuts into...

	...something that looks like a vine...but BLEEDS RED!

	Aiken traces the thing with his eyes, up to where it's

	coiled in high tree branches. It's the oversized body...

	...of A COPPERHEAD, with a belly SIX FEET in diameter.

	As Aiken gasps, spellbound, he's STUCK from behind.

	The snake is so long, its body is draped on one side of the

	greenhouse, but its head is on the other. With the power

	of a dozer-shovel..JAWS like the open hood of a Cadillac...

	TEETH the size of windows...CLAMP onto Aiken's mid-section,

	instantly CRUSHING his ribs.

	Chris finds a skein of ROPE. He throws the long end over a

	ceiling beam, then instantly makes a LASSO out of the piece

	in _is hand and tosses the loop at the snake's head .

	Aiken's body, in the serpent's jaws, makes the rope miss.

	Chris throws again. In the seconds between tosses, the snake

	has SLURPED Aiken into its mouth. The rope encircles the

	beast's head. Chris pulls. The noose slips down over the

	snake's maxillaries and tightens around its neck. Chris uses

	all his strength. With the ceiling beam as a pulley, the

	snake's head is SLAMMED against the rafters.

				CHRIS

			(To Rebecca) Hold this.

	Rebecca is, understandably, not quick to respond.

	Pg-63

				CHRIS (cont.)

			GET IN HERE, SOLDIER!

	In this crisis, Chris finds himself sounding a lot like

	Wesker. It sobers him. It sobers Rebecca, as well. She

	rushes in and takes hold of the rope.

	Moving fast, Chris rushes to where Aiken's knife dropped

	on the floor. He grabs it, turns back, and sees...

	...something MOVING inside the snake's beaded torso. It's

	Aiken... still alive.

	Chris charges, PLUNGES the knife into the beast, hacking

	through layers of fat until he reaches a bloody CAVITY.

	Aiken is curled within, like Jonah in the Whale. His chest

	has been crushed to half its normal size. Acids from the

	monster's intestine have begun to eat through flesh on his hands,

	his face, but he's still conscious, able to wheeze-out words.

				AIKEN

			K-kill me. S-Sullvan said...I'd

			be.. .better off dead. That...ain't

			never been truer than now. Kill me!

	The snake uses all its strength to lower its head from the

	ceiling. Rebecca hangs bravely onto the rope, but she's

	LIFTED, bodily, off the floor.

	The rope SNAPS, cut by the steel beam. Rebecca falls. The

	trailing edge of the noose catches on twisted debris. It

	delays the snake for two seconds.

	Those fragile seconds give Chris just enough time to reach

	into the open belly of the monster...and pull the PINS on

	TWO GRENADES that dangle from Aiken's vest.

	The giant copperhead SNAPS at Chris from behind, missing him

	by inches. He dives, like a wide-receiver reaching for a

	pass. What he catches is...

	...Rebecca's arm. His momentum carries her down to the

	floor. They roll behind another STONE WALL that contains

	tons of earth, which protects them from...

	...BOO-BOOOOOM!... the explosions of the grenades... which blow

	Aiken... and yards of the snake's mid-section...into eternity.

	INT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS

	The same nervous HANDS that we saw in the opening fidget on

	the polished surface of the conference table. A distorted

	VOICE scratches over a speaker-phone.

	Pg-64

				VOICE ON THE PHONE (o.s. filter)

			We're close. I think I'll be able

			to get the package. It's been...

			very interesting.

				VOICE IN THE ROOM

			Anything you can't handle?

				VOICE ON THE PHONE (o.s. filter)

			(Chuckling) There's nothing I

	A hand with an ostentatious RING flicks cigar ash.

				HOLDEN

			Keep us appraised.

	Holden's hand clicks off the speaker-phone.

				HOLDEN (cont.)

			(To the others in the room) I'm

			reassured, gentlemen...that every-

			thing is...under control.

	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS

	WESKER, alone in the strange, faceted corridor, packs away

	his radio. He hears... FOOTSTEPS. JILL appears.

				WESKER

			Where are the others?

				JILL

			Right behind me. Were you...

			talking to someone?

				WESKER

			To Washington. To my... superiors.

			They're your superiors too, Valentine.

			Don't forget that.

	Jill wonders. Should she challenge Wesker? She has no time

	to think. More FOOTSTEPS come CLACKING at her back. It's

	RODRIGUEZ and SPEYER. A moment later, BARRY and VICKERS

	appear from the opposite direction.

				BARRY

			Nothin'. man. No doors. Nothin'.

			We hit a dead end.

				SPEYER

			Us too. Cement wall.

				VICKERS

			We're never gonna get to that lab.

	Pg-65

	TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG... a sound like a rivet gun resounds

	in the corridor, repetitive, but random, not rhythmic.

	INT   ELECTRIC TUNNEL   TIMELESS

	CHRIS and REBECCA are crawling through a two-foot high

	feeder-passage for electric cables, their bellies scraping

	the floor, their backs the ceiling. They hear the sound...

	...TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG! Then suddenly...it stops.

				REBECCA

			(Crying quietly) I... can't take

			this any more.

				CHRIS

			We take what comes. That's the

			secret of our genius.

	He looks back. Rebecca sniffles.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			How old are you?

				REBECCA

			Not very old at all. Not nearly

			old enough to...to...

				CHRIS

			None of us is old enough for that.

	Rebecca nods, forcing a smile meant to be appreciative.

				REBECCA

			Jill... told me... you were nice .

				CHRIS

			She did? She never told me.

	That sound returns... TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG...getting louder.

	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS

	Down in the corridor, the other TROOPERS see...

	...faintly in the dusty reaches of the dark... AGILE SHAPES

	advancing... not along the floor, but along the CEILING!

	They look like apes, swinging from... What could they be

	swinging from? The ceiling is solid metal.

	CLOSE ON: A MONSTROUS HAND, both hairy, and scaly. It's

	fingers have ten-inch claws.. .more like horns... which PUNCH

	upward, penetrating the ceiling metal, and clamping on.

	Pg-66

	THE SHOT WIDENS to reveal A BEAST, unlike any we've seen,

	dangling from the ceiling. It is ape-like... and lizard-

	like. With ferocious eyes that glare from beneath an insect-

	like carapace. This thing is an amalgam of all the nasty

	creatures that have pursued us in our nightmares. It's

	called... A HUNTER.

	There are SIX OF THEM... as far as we can see, there might be

	more coming from behind. Their three-toed feet also have

	claws that can pierce the ceiling, enabling them to move

	forward... hand over foot, foot over hand.

	One of them lets out a GRRROWLLLL! The same sound we've

	been hearing through the walls. Now it echos in the

	corridor, up close and personal. The troopers open fire,

	even before the creatures get in range.

	INT   ELECTRIC TUNNEL   TIMELESS

	CHRIS and REBECCA hear the gunfire.

				CHRIS

			Hurry.

	Chris crawls on. Rebecca is stopped when... TCHUNNNNGGG !

	One of the HUNTERS' CLAWS PUNCHES up through the floor ,

	almost stabbing her. Rebecca SCREAMS. In the tight space,

	Chris is barely able to reach back and take her hand.

	TCHUNNNNGG! TGG! More CLAWS penetrate the metal.

	The couple plunge ahead of them, the way Chris plunged

	ahead of the bullets on Level "A".

	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS

	WESKER, JILL and the OTHERS spit lead at the advancing

	creatures. Bullets THUNK into their bodies. Blood flows,

	but the creatures seem to feel no pain. Even when they're

	hit squarely in their skulls.

				BARRY

			Head shots. Ain't doin' nothin'!

				WESKER

			That was the idea.

				BARRY

			What idea?

				WESKER

			To win. The idea was... to win.

	Pg-67

	Jill aims at one of the hunters, pressing the trigger of

	her M-16, and not letting go until her clip runs out.

	The creature's head is turned RAGGED by the barrage...

	revealing an iron SUPERSTRUCTURE beneath the skin.

				VOICE (o.s.)

			Now that... is a metal-head.

	Jill looks up. CHRIS jumps out of the open grate in the

	ceiling. REBECCA jumps down after him.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			What d'ya think? Should I wait

			for orders, or just wing it?

				JILL

			Wing it!

				CHRIS

			You know...that just might be

			the ticket. Wing the fuckers.

	Chris takes a careful SHOT with-his Winchester. He hits one

	of the Hunters squarely on its WRIST...which SNAPS. The

	creature drops to the floor.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			Forget the head shots. They're

			useless. Shoot for the joints.

			The JOINTS!

	Rebecca opens FIRE with Aiken's M-16, giving the others time

	to reload. Barry is the first to resume firing...at the

	closest of the Hunters... at its wrists, which are SNAPPED

	by the bullets. The creature drops to the floor.

	The troopers fire at KNEES, ANKLES, ELBOWS, which seem to

	be the weakest spots. More of the hunters drop from the

	ceiling...but they continue to advance, crawling, pushing

	themselves forward with whatever limbs remain intact.

				SPEYER

			Run! We slowed 'em down. Run!

				BARRY

			Where? As far as we'll get, either

			way, is a cement wall.

	There are two hunters left on the ceiling. One of them makes

	a mighty, impossible LUNGE... and hits Speyer like a battering

	ram, slashing his CHEST OPEN with its claws.

	Two of the hunters on the floor rush forward, not attacking,

	but wanting to feed on Speyer's remains.

	Pg-68

	Brad, trembling, completely crazed, drops his weapon and

	backs away. He sees...one of those jigsaw tiles, a RED

	one, GLOW from within. He thinks he's hallucinating until...

	...the floor JERKS, in a tight spasm. Its steel facets

	begin to separate, sliding away from each other. The

	troopers narrowly escape as.. .

	...the floor behind them GRINDS, in and out, left and right,

	as if it were CHEWING. Speyer's body, and those of the

	hunters on the floor, are EATEN by the powerful steel blades.

	But one hunter remains above it all. TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG,

	it continues to advance along the ceiling.

	An invisible, JIGSAWED DOOR glides open twenty yards down

	the hall. The troopers run for it, and are met by a

	beautiful Asian scientist... the woman we saw on the video

	playback... ADA WONG.

				ADA

			You lost a man. If I had only

			been faster. I was unfamiliar

			with the mechanism.

	TCHUNG TCHUNG... the Hunter approaches .

				ADA (cont.)

			God. One of them... is still ..

			Quickly. Inside. Quickly!

	The troopers rush into...

	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS

	...a security cubicle. CHRIS is the last to enter, barely

	making it before the door begins to slide shut.

	KA-TCHUNK! CLAWS penetrate the opening.

				ADA

			Don't worry, it's mindless. It

			doesn't realize that it's strong

			enough to push the door open.

				BARRY (cont.)

			Sometimes the dumb get lucky.

				RODRIGUEZ

			Hasn't happened to me, yet.

	The Hunter GROWLS. Its snout darkens the space between door

	and wall. Mucous from its nostrils spits through.

	Pg-69

	After a terrifying moment, the claw recedes. The dark

	snout disappears. The snorting fades away. Followed by

	a distant...TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG...as the hunter departs.

	Everyone relaxes, visibly.

	The troopers turn and, for the first time, notice two haggard

	SCIENTISTS standing across the room.

				ADA

			My... colleagues. Benjamin. Toshiro.

			As far as we know, we are the...only

			ones.. .left alive. We worked on "C"

			level. One of the biologists saved us.

			Brought us down here. He knew that...

			he didn't have long to live. He...

			started the mechanism... out there,

			in the corridor.. .and he let it...

			take him.

	Ada stares at a complicated control panel.

				ADA (cont.)

			I only saw it used that one time.

			Or perhaps...I could have been

			faster. The man...you lost...

				RODRIGUEZ

			You did fine, lady. We're obliged.

				ADA

			As are we. (Sighing) We believed...

			we would die here. Believed...the

			bomb would destroy us.

				 JILL

			You knew.. .about the bomb?

				ADA

			The end for a place like this, when

			it fails... must be a bomb, yes?

	Jill looks at Chris. His point has been proven.

				ADA (cont.)

			But now... that you are here... the

			bomb will not come.

				CHRIS

			It... already came. ma'am. We

			brought it. The colonel, here...

			he's wearing it.

	Ada looks at the detonator on Wesker's belt, at the sequence

	of blinking lights.

	70

				ADA

			(To Wesker) Is it true? Are you

			here to... rescue? Or destroy?

				WESKER

			Both. (With that odd smile of his)

			If I have to pick only one... I'll

			pick destroy.

				ADA

			You're not S.T.A.R.S. You're Umbrella.

				WESKER

			Once again. Both. (Still smiling)

			Two salaries. Three if you count

			combat pay.

	Ada looks at him with disgust.

				ADA

			The man I loved, John Marcus...

			developed the organism that caused

			all this. He... he did it for

			humanitarian purposes. It was

			taken away from him...for in-human

			purposes...by men like you!

				WESKER

			No, ma'am. Men like me... are just

			errand boys. Sent in to do the

			wet-work. All of the glory. None

			of the benefits.

				ADA

			After what you've seen down here,

			do you think any of it could be

			turned into... benefit?

				WESKER

			Yes. I think it could be turned

			into five or ten million dollars.

			How do we get into "D" lab?

				ADA

			Death lab. (She slumps) John

			was killed...never even knowing it

			existed. They kept him... isolated,

			upstairs, while a separate team was

			down here...corrupting his research.

			Using it to build B.O.W.s.

				CHRIS

			B.O.W.s?

	Pg-71

				ADA

			Bio-organic weapons.

				REBECCA

			The sharks. The plant.

				ADA

			Early experiments.

				CHRIS

			The snake.

				ADA

			A failure. Its behavior remained

			reptilian. All they could ever get

			it to do was... grow in size.

				RODRIGUEZ

			Those dogs. They were weapons.

				ADA

			No. They... simply became infected.

			As did... everyone else. Janitors.

			The cook. Electricians. Guards.

			People who believed they were serving

			their flag. Scientists. Great minds...

			turned into mindless.. .ghouls!

				CHRIS

			Before the outbreak, the experiments

			went further, didn't they? Those...

			ceiling-crawlers out there.. .

				ADA

			The product of human DNA spliced

			with the DNA of vicious carnivores...

			animals, even insects. Plated with

			armor, beneath newly cultivated skin.

			Then... injected with poison, so their

			biological components would die.

				JILL

			Die.

				ADA

			The "T"-virus reactivates them in a

			matter of minutes, but... in battle,

			lost minutes are... inconvenient. So,

			the B.O.W.s had to die... and be allowed

			to revive before they could be used to...

			full advantage. They were murdered...

			by their own people... so they could

			never be murdered again... by the enemy.

	Pg-72

				CHRIS

			Were any more of these...weapons...

			developed?

	Ada is about to answer, but Wesker interrupts.

				WESKER

			HOW DO WE GET INTO "D" LAB?

				ADA

			You don't.

	Ada glances at an innocuous wall panel. Wesker notices a

	key-slot. Green.

				ADA (cont.)

			It can't be opened. Thank God.

			None of us is cleared for that

			level of security.

				WESKER

			How fortunate... that I am.

	Wesker steps over to the wall and inserts his green card into

	the slot. The panel slides open. Beyond it is a steel door

	with another green slot. Wesker uses his card again. A lock

	CLICKS. Wesker pushes the door open.

				WESKER (cont.)

			Barry. Come with me. The rest of

			you.. .make sure this door doesn't

			close. Remember...

	Wesker taps his ear-piece. Everyone gets his meaning. He

	and Barry disappear through the opening. The steel door

	begins to close. Rodriguez lunges, and catches it.

				ADA

			Have...you been leaving doors open?

				JILL

			Yes.

				ADA

			This place is going to be overrun by...

				REBECCA

			Brad's in really bad shape.

	Brad is leaning against a wall, sweating, shivering. Rebecca

	looks at his wounded leg.

				REBECCA (cont.)

			That's not just a scrape. You

			were bitten, weren't you?

	Pg-73

				VICKERS

			One...of the sharks. Its teeth.

			I Just...brushed up against its

			teeth...after it was dead.

				ADA

			(Alert) Shoot him. Somebody,

			shoot him!

				JILL

			No! We're so close. The antidote.

	INT   STAIRWELL   TIMELESS

	WESKER and BARRY trot down a flight of metal stairs.

				BARRY

			What's got into you man? This...

			this isn't like you.

				WESKER

			Oh, yes, this is exactly like me.

	Until now, Wesker has been steadfast. He suddenly seems

	nervous, anxious. Some of it is fear. Most of it is

	anticipation of the goal which is suddenly within reach.

				WESKER (cont.)

			This is...what I've been all my life.

			A guy... suckin' up to the honchos.

			Wipin' the shit off their asses...

			all the while lookin' for a break.

			A way to get some of my own! Well

			this it, friend. I'm myself,

			alright. And I know exactly what

			I'm doing. I told you...before this

			day was over... I'd pay you back.

	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS

	CHRIS and JILL step past RODRIGUEZ. They take off down the

	stairs.

	As they leave, ADA opens a desk drawer and pulls out a .45.

				RODRIGUEZ

			(Looking at the gun) You know

			how to use that thing, chica?

				ADA

			Of course I do. I'm a scientist.

	Pg-74

	Ada CLICKS back the bolt, whips up the .45, and aims it at

	BRAD'S head. REBECCA dives in front of the man.

				REBECCA

			No! You can't! Not while there's

			still a chance to save him!

	INT   SAFETY CHAMBER   "D" LAB   TIMELESS

	WESKER and BARRY arrive at a set of PLEXIGLASS DOORS. They

	can't see through them, they're FOGGED. Wesker finds a key

	slot, inserts his access card, and...

	...WHOOSH... the doors open. A CLOUD OF HYPER-COLD MIST

	rushes out, instantly coating the men in FROST. Wesker

	doesn't feel the cold. He doesn't feel anything, except

	a surge of triumph. He steps through the opening into...

	INT "D" LAB TIMELESS

	...a laboratory that looks like-the cockpit of a Concorde...

	only a hundred times larger.. Nothing is, recognizable, except

	desks that hold futuristic-Ibokin computers. A befuddling

	array of BUTTONS, SWITCHES, stuttering LIGHTS, covers every

	inch of wall space.

	And at the center of it all stands a tall, cylindrical TANK,

	a stasis tube, filled with ICE. It's mounted on a six-foot

	tall platform, like an altar, with cables and flexible tubes

	running out of it. Wesker squints, and through the freeze,

	sees the thing that stands sedated within the cylinder...

	...THE TYRANT. It's nine feet tall. Like the hunters, it

	has more or less human form, though it's musculature is more

	defined than Superman's. One of its arms is scaled to size,

	but the other is much longer. Its hand dangles at knee-

	level. Monstrous steel CLAWS depend from its fingers,

	nearly touching the floor.

				WESKER

			(In awe) It's called... the Tyrant.

			Nobody knows it exists. Except us...

			and Holden.

				BARRY

			Holden?

				WESKER

			Umbrella's man in D.C. We need him.

			He signs the checks. (Excited) We've

			got it, Barry! Our fortune!

	Pg-75

				BARRY

			You're not gonna try to get this

			big mother outta here ?

				WESKER

			Don't have to. All we need is the

			data. Then.. .these things can be

			cranked out on an assembly line!

	Laying down his automatic, WESKER hits computer keys until

	a DISK pops out of a master-feed.

				WESKER (cont.)

			YES! This is it!

				BARRY

			What about the antidote?

				WESKER

			Antidote? (Laughing) There is no

			antidote. That was just happy horse

			shit, to keep the team going.

	Neither man notices... that the removal of the master disk has

	caused certain systems to fail... indicated by red lights, and

	by the fact that... the walls of the Tyrant's cylinder are

	beginning to run liquid sweat. The ice... is MELTING.

				BARRY

			You're gonna give this to Umbrella?

				WESKER

			No. I'm gonna sell it to them. Then

			I'm gonna open a Swiss bank account...

			right next to yours.

				JILL (o.s.)

			God...damn!

	JILL has appeared in the doorway with CHRIS. They both

	at the monster with awe...and terror.

				JILL (cont.)

			That thing... can't be real!

				WESKER

			It's real, alright. And it's worth...

			more than gold. More than uranium!

				RODRIGUEZ

			Do we get a piece of that action?

	ROSIE has arrived. So have REBECCA, ADA, and the two

	surviving SCIENTISTS.

	Pg-76

				WESKER

			All of you do. Anyone who comes out

			of this alive... gets a taste.

				RODRIGUEZ (o.s.)

			I'm in. I been eatin' shit all my

			life. I'm happy to eat some more...

			as long as it's got some gravy on it.

	Rosie steps into the lab, her weapon ready.

				WESKER

			Anybody else see it my way?

	One of the scientists, TOSHIRO, rushes to join.

				ADA

			(To Toshiro) You disgrace yourself!

				TOSHIRO

			I...I want to live.

				WESKER

			Smart. Anyone else? Valentine?

	Jill looks at Chris. Then she steps through the doorway and

	takes a defensive post beside her c.o.

				CHRIS

			And I was gonna try to disarm the

			bomb. This place should be destroyed!

			It needs to be destroyed!

	Chris lifts his rifle. Wesker is faster with his pistol,

	aiming it at Chris' belly.

				WESKER

			Gotcha, son. It's only because

			of Valentine, here, that I didn't

			squeeze the trigger.

	Chris and Jill exchange dagger eyes.

				CHRIS

			If she's on your side... she doesn't

			mean shit to me. And I don't mean

			shit to her.

				JILL

			Chris, please. There's only... one

			way to go, here .

				WESKER

			That's right. My way!

	Pg-77

				JILL

			Yes, sir. Your way!

	Jill presses in close to Wesker, as if completely allied.

				JILL (cont.)

			I...can't yell you, Chris...how much

			I wanted...things to have turned out

			differently. (Beat) Goodbye.

	Swiftly, unexpectedly, Jill snatches the detonator wire and

	pulls the sensor out of Wesker's ear.

	Everyone shuts their eyes, expecting to be blown sky-high.

	Nothing happens.

	Jill pulls the detonator off Wesker's belt. She stares

	small LED screen which reads... 14:42:16... 15... 14...

				JILL (cont.)

			Shit. I got all my courage up...

			and we still have fifteen minutes!

	Jill tosses the detonator to Chris. Wesker turns on her,

	lifting his M-16...

				BARRY

			You shoot. I shoot, boss.

	Wesker turns to find Barry's weapon aiming at his belly.

				BARRY (cont.)

			Shit.. here I am still callin'

			you 'boss'.

	Wesker is holding the data-disk. Suddenly, he feels it

	snatched away...by Ada, who has rushed into the room.

	He aims his weapon at her back as she darts away. Before

	he can fire, he's KICKED in the head... by Jill. Buckling,

	dazed, he looks up at her.

				JILL

			We believed in you. I believed

			in you. Boy, was I a sucker.

	She kicks him again, just for the hell of it. He flops on

	the floor, his eye-socket swollen. He's dropped his gun.

	He gropes for it. Barry steps in and boots it away.

	A KLAXON SOUNDS! Emergency!

	The ice in the Tyrant's tank has melted down to a critical

	level. The monster... is beginning to MOVE.

	Pg-78

	Reaching the doorway, Ada hears a mechanism TRIP in the jamb.

	The Plexiglas doors begin to slide shut. Ada strains to

	hold them back.

				ADA

			Get out! Now! Or you never will!

				RODRIGUEZ

			So... we'll live here! (Glancing at

			the Tyrant) No. The landlord looks

			like a sonuvabitch.

	Rosie rushes in to help Ada hold the doors. So does

	BENJAMIN, the second of the surviving scientists, who is...

	...MAULED from behind by a ZOMBIE. It's not just any zombie.

	It's BRAD VICKERS, back from death, who BITES out the artery

	in Benjamin's neck.

				ADA

			I TOLD YOU... TO SHOOT HIM!

	Ada lifts her .45 and blows Vickers way. She looks down

	at Benjamin, writhing on the floor, aims at his head... and

	FIRES again.

	Rodriguez is the only one holding the doors. Jill rushes

	to help her.

				JILL

			Everybody! OUT!

				CHRIS

			(Off the LED) Thirteen minutes.

	Inside the lab, Barry turns to Toshiro, the other scientist.

				BARRY

			Go.

	Toshiro hesitates... a second too long. KRAAASSSH! The

	stasis tube BURSTS open. WATER and bits of ICE fly out...

	along with an enormous, bionic HAND. Big-enough to grab

	Toshiro's head as if it were a cantaloupe. Powerful enough

	to CRUSH that head as if it were... well, a cantaloupe.

	Wesker, still searching for his pistol, sees all this.

	The Tyrant is not completely free. Much of the cylinder

	wall has cracked away, but sections of it cling to a now

	misshapen mass of ice that still holds the monster bound.

	Though it won1t for much longer.

	Wesker starts toward the door. Barry grabs the back of his

	shirt and pitches him across the lab.

	Pg-79

				BARRY (cont.)

			You and me... we ain't goin' nowhere.

			Not just now, boss.

	Barry turns to the others clustered at the doorway.

				BARRY (cont.)

			This thing gets loose, it's gonna

			be pissed. Somebody's gotta hold it

			back. Give you guys a fair chance.

				JILL

			LOOK OUT!

	Wesker has found his pistol. He FIRES at Barry who, ducking,

	is only GRAZED. Wesker aims at the group in the doorway.

	Barry pops out from behind a desk and shoots back at him.

	Ada and Rebecca duck away from the doors, pulling Rodriguez

	and a reluctant Jill after them. The doors begin to slide

	closed. Chris valiantly tries to prevent them from shutting.

	Wesker CRAWLS lke a dog. He manages to fling an arm

	out through the opening. Steel bumpers press on the meat

	of his forearm. Wesker looks up. Through the Plexiglas,

	his eyes meet Chris'.

				WESKER

			Get me outta here, Redfield. Or so

			help me God, you're a dead man.

	With his free hand, Wesker aims his pistol at Chris. The gun

	barrel is an intimidating sight, even though it's on the other

	side of the plexi. Chris glances at the others.

				CHRIS

			Get going.

				JILL

			Not without...

				CHRIS

			MOVE!

	Ada, Rebecca and Rodriguez wrestle Jill away bodily, and

	start up the metal stairway.

				WESKER

			COME BACK! RODRIGUEZ! VALENTINE!

			THAT'S AN ORDER !

				CHRIS

			Orders don't mean shit any more,

			Wesker. Especially when they come

			from sell-out bastards like you.

	Pg-80

	Chris lets go. The doors squeeze tighter. Wesker SCREAMS.

	Through the plexi, Chris catches a glimpse of Barry, who

	stands and gives him a military salute. Chris salutes back.

	BLAM BLAM BLAM... Wesker FIRES three rounds. Dusty blemishes

	appear on the bulletproof glass. The slugs ricochet back

	into the lab.

	One of them CHIPS away at the ICE which is less and less

	able to contain the Tyrant.

	Chris makes a break for the stairs. Wesker twists his body

	in an attempt to push his pistol through the opening, but his

	fist, around the stock, is too thick. Nonetheless, Wesker

	FIRES .BLAM BLAM BLAM... bullets SCREAM off the banister

	rails, but none of them contact Chris' legs which disappear

	up the stairs.

	The ice in the stasis tube is turning to slush. The Tyrant

	is about to break loose. Wesker looks pleadingly at Barry.

				WESKER

			B-buddy. You gotta get us out.

				BARRY

			Not sure I know how, boss. Do you?

			Is there some other...'need-to-know'

			secret for shutting down the Big

			Bopper, here?

				WESKER

			No. It.. it can't be shut down.

				BARRY

			The ultimate warrior. The ultimate

			soldier. We'll see. How it does

			against a couple of hard-ass career

			guys, like you and me.

	WESKER swings his free arm and aims his pistol at BARRY.

	CLICK! The gun is empty.

	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS

	The ESCAPEES arrive in the security cubicle.

				ADA

			The corridor outside... can be moved.

	Ada rushes over to the instrument panel. Her hands go to

	work on an array of buttons and switches.

	Pg-81

	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS

	The multi-faceted CORRIDOR TWISTS into a new configuration

	Ada pulls a RED KEY from under her lab coat, snaps the chain

	on her neck, and holds it out to Chris.

				ADA (cont.)

			I took it from an Umbrella agent

			assigned to us here. He died...

			like all the rest.

				CHRIS

			Red... overrides green.

				ADA

			Yes.

				CHRIS

			So... you could have unlocked "D" lab.

				ADA

			I was hoping it would never be un-

			locked again. Go. I will see that

			this.. .(she holds up the data disk) ...

			is destroyed.

	Chris grabs Ada's arm and holds it tight while he wrenches

	the disk away from her.

	He folds it over onto itself, drops it to the floor, and

	pumps three Winchester rounds into it.

				CHRIS

			It's destroyed. It's worthless

			But you're not.

				ADA

			I helped develop it!

	Pg-82

				CHRIS

			Unwittingly. They lied to you.

			They lied to Marcus. They made

			you believe you were doing a good

			thing when it wasn't good at all.

			It was evil!

	Ada looks deeply into Chris' eyes.

				CHRIS (cont.)

			The kind of evil that... resides

			in all of us. Makes us... greedy,

			uncaring. The kind of evil that

			will... wipe us out, in the end.

			Unless we stand up against it.

				ADA

			Stand up? Against powers that have...

			ruled the world since before we were

			born? We will only be...eliminated.

			Or locked away someplace else. I'd

			rather die here. Knowing that the

			virus has died with me .

	Jill takes a step toward Ada.

				JILL

			What if it's already spread? You're

			the only one...who knew anything

			about it.

				ADA

			(The thought penetrating) But, I...

			know so little.

				 CHRIS

			More than anyone else. You have...

			a responsibility.

				JILL

			To a higher command. The highest.

	She and Chris touch eyes again, this time with understanding.

	INT   "D" LAB   TIMELESS

	THE TYRANT flexes its monumental muscles. The ice around

	it CRACKS... but clings. The giant HEART dangling outside

	its chest PUMPS rapidly...sending fluids through exposed

	synthetic veins that run to the creature's brain.

				BARRY

			That's one helluva big pump.

	Pg-83

				WESKER

			An implant.

				BARRY

			From what? A fuckin' elephant?

				WESKER

			Rhinoceros.

				BARRY

			Shit. I figured you knew more than

			you were telling.

	Barry FIRES at the encased organ. His bullets bounce off the

	shielding with no effect.

				BARRY (cont.)

			How do we kill this thing?

				WESKER

			I told you, we don't. W-we can't.

			It's unstoppable!

	More ICE pops off the monster's pectorals.

	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS

	CLOSE ON: ADA'S face.

				ADA

			I don't know if I can face this.

	She and the ESCAPEES are no longer in the Cubicle. They're

	in the runway.

				CHRIS

			Just get us upstairs. I'll take

			care of it from there.

				ADA

			Alright. (With a sigh) Come.

	They break out, at the run, klacking along the faceted steel

	floor of the movable... and still moving.. .corridor.

	KRUNNNGGG! They're nearly knocked off their feet when the

	system suddenly STOPS DEAD.

	Ada slams her fist into one of those JIGSAW TILES on the

	wall. Another RED one, which glows from within.

	A PANEL grinds open, revealing...

	Pg-84

	INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   TIMELESS

	...a more natural-looking corridor. Half-way along, there

	are STEEL PRONGS that protrude from a wall. The group starts

	toward them...but stops when a soul-shriveling SOUND fills

	the passageway...the hungry MOANING of things that are dead.

				ADA

			Doors... were left open.

	INT   "D" LAB   TIMELESS

	The TYRANT BREAKS free of the last bit of restricting ice.

	WESKER FREAKS. Whimpering, he gropes with his hand that's

	outside the Plexiglas doors. He grabs something. A BOOT.

	Brad Vickers' boot. Wesker tugs on it.

	BARRY opens fire on the Tyrant, full bore, with his M-16.

	The stream of bullets does nothing except make the monster

	notice the big man.

	INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   TIMELESS

	THE ESCAPEES run down the corridor. SHAPES appear at the

	far end. ZOMBIES! Twenty. Thirty. Forty. More. The

	walking remains of humans who were infected in the labs,

	crawling over each other, hungry for living flesh.

	The humans reach the FREIGHT LOADER. Prongs, like those on

	a fork lift, extend from a heavy chain-drive that runs up

	and down through openings in the floor and ceiling.

	ADA swipes her red key through a slot and pushes a button.

	The chain-drive Grinds upward, hoisting the prongs.

				ADA

			Step on.

	Ada pushes REBECCA onto the next set of prongs that come up

	out of the floor. The footing is precarious. Rebecca has

	to hold on to the chain as she is hoisted.

	The lift moves slowly, eight feet separating each set of

	prongs.

	The ghouls continue to press in.

				JILL

			I don't know if it's gonna happen.

				RODRIGUEZ

			Come on. I been waitin' all day

			for somthin. like this.

	Pg-85

	Rosie opens FIRE. Chris and Jill follow suit as Ada steps

	onto the next set of prongs.

	Blood FLIES. Skulls SHATTER. Front ranks drop. Zombies

	from behind push their fallen comrades ahead of them. The

	corridor is like a syringe filled with corrupted bodies,

	pushing inexorably forward.

	Rosie, teeth gritted, keeps firing while Chris forces Jill

	onto the next set of prongs. As she rises, she hands her

	M-16 to Chris. He slings it on his arm while levering his

	old Winchester, making each of his shots count, until the

	next set of prongs rises out of the floor.

				CHRIS

			(To Rosie) You're up.

				RODRIGUEZ

			I'm havin' too much fun. You got

			a lady. I just got me. Anyway...

			I ain't gonna die in this rat hole.

			I'll make it. Get outta here.

	Chris hands Jill's rifle to Rosie, who fires with both hands

	as Chris jumps onto the lift.

	Zombies are MOWED DOWN. But more come. The syringe keeps

	pressing.

	The next prongs rise. Rosie steps on, still blasting..

	The first zombies reach her. Shooting down, she blows them

	away. But more come, grabbing her legs, grabbing the chains,

	ROCKING the prongs. Rosie nearly falls. She drops one of

	the rifles in order to hold on. She carefully picks off the

	most threatening zombies. Miraculously, she rises out of

	their reach, and into...

	INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS

	...a very tight, very dark SPACE with sheet metal walls that

	have been bruised by loads of freight. The rumble of the

	chain-drive ECHOES frighteningly.

	ABOVE ROSIE, THE OTHERS rise slowly... very slowly... feeling

	apprehensive, vulnerable. REBECCA, at the top, looks up and

	sees LIGHT spilling through an opening through which she is

	about to pass.

				ADA

			(Calling up to her) Level "C".

			Have your weapons ready.

				RODRIGUEZ

			(From below) Whoop-de-doo.

	Pg-86

	Rebecca's eyes rise above the floor of Level "C". All seems

	quiet... but who knows what might be lurking.

	INT "D" LAB TIMELESS

	THE TYRANT, still a bit sluggish, steps down from the

	platform that supported its tank. BARRY jams in a fresh

	clip and keeps firing at the thing. The Tyrant, impervious,

	stalks after the big trooper.

	Wesker is still on the floor, his arm through the doors,

	tugging on Vickers' boot.

	The flesh on Wesker's forearm is PEELED by the bumpers as

	he uses all his strength to drag Vickers' body closer...

	until the boot winds up in the opening, preventing the doors

	from closing.

	Wesker manages to pull his bloody arm free. He rushes to

	a computer console and types a request for the "T"-virus.

				BARRY

			Get under a desk, man. I'm gonna

			feed this thing a pineapple.

	Barry pulls a GRENADE from his belt.

				WESKER

			NO! It might damage the system!

			I've got to get this data!

	Wesker's M-16 has been lying, where he left it, on the

	console. He picks it up.

				BARRY

			Forget it. Bullets don't work!

	Barry is about to pull the pin on the grenade when Wesker

	triggers off A BURST...into BARRY'S GUT!

				WESKER

			They seem to work just fine.

	Barry is BLASTED across the lab.

	The Tyrant makes its first quick move... making us appreciate

	how fast and powerful it really is. It swipes at Barry's

	body as it flies through the air, catching it in it's steel

	claw. We hears BONES SNAP as Barry goes limp.

				WESKER (cont.)

			That's it. Take a little lunch

			break, Mr. "T". I just need a few

			more seconds.

	Pg-87

	The Tyrant lifts Barry's body, as if it were as light as a

	feather, up to its snout. Recognizing that the man is dead,

	the monster FLINGS him aside like so much garbage... and

	begins to lumber toward Wesker.

				WESKER (cont.)

			(To the computer) Come on, come on.. .

	A monitor reads: 90% COMPLETE...95%...98%. Wesker rests

	a finger on the button to eject a floppy.

	The Tyrant is getting closer by the second. Wesker FIRES

	a burst at it which only slows it for a heartbeat.

	100%.. .TRANSFER COMPLETED. Wesker ejects the floppy, jams

	it into his flack-jacket, and, FIRING another burst, runs

	for the door. The Tyrant has to move around desks and

	computer consoles to catch him.

	Wesker shoves his M-16 through the space that's being held

	open by Vickers' boot. He begins to pry the opening wider.

	A WARNING BUZZER goes off. The Tyrant dimly registers

	the sound. Its eyes dilate, like camera shutters, with

	a CLI-CLICK. It strides forward at top peed, PITCHING

	DESKS easily aside, SMASHING through a CONSOLE as if it

	were made of balsa.

	Wesker has pried the doors wide. The Tyrant is coming at

	him FAST. It's going to be very close.

	Wesker MAKES IT. He gets outside. The doors begin to glide

	shut. He LAUGHS!

				WESKER (cont.)

			EAT SHIT, YOU...

	THLANNG! The Tyrant's long, bionic CLAWS SHOOT, with the

	speed of switch-blades, through the opening, just before the

	doors meet. FOUR of the claws SKEWER WESKER, passing clean

	through him.

	He doesn't die instantly. He's still alive and SCREAMING

	when the Tyrant uses the same hand, with Wesker impaled on

	it, to PUSH the doors open wide again. The action causes

	WESKER'S HEAD to be SLICED OFF by one of the steel bumpers.

	The Tyrant steps out of the lab. As the doors glide shut,

	the monster holds the remainder of Wesker's body inside

	their path.

	The bumpers are stopped by the Tyrant's iron hand... which

	it extracts, letting the doors scrape the dead meat from

	its claws.

	Pg-88

	INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS

	REBECCA is approaching another OPENING.

				ADA

			Level "B".

	INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS

	THE CORRIDOR on Level "B" is long and narrow, with only

	occasional pools of LIGHT from bare, overhanging bulbs.

	REBECCA rises, like a spirit, out of the floor. She lifts

	her weapon. Her eyes dart, looking for dangers. There are

	none. The corridor, while very spooky, is quiet.

				REBECCA

			Don't see anything.

				ADA

			Good.

	INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS

	REBECCA rises through the ceiling.

				ADA

			We're almost there. You'll have

			to jump off. The belt won't stop.

	As the ECHO of Ada's voice rings off, Rebecca looks up and...

	...SCREEEE... SOMETHING dives down on her out of the darkness.

	She ducks, almost losing her balance. She clings to the

	chain as OTHER THINGS...black, relatively small.. .WHIP past

	her head.

				REBECCA

			Bats! There are bats in here!

				ADA

			No. They're crows! Infected!

			Don't let them bite you!

	Rebecca dodges with new urgency as the black birds dive past

	her. Looking up, she sees more coming. She aims her M-16

	and fires up the shaft. TWO BIRDS are HIT. They plummet.

	One hits ADA. She swats it aside. It drops all the way

	down to ROSIE, who JUMPS, gasping, when it hits her.

				RODRIGUEZ

			Rats. FLYING RATS!

	Pg-89

	Beneath her, Rosie sees the crows hovering in the light from

	Level "B"... They circle, then start to fly up again.

	Rosie opens fire, filling the shaft with ribbons of lead.

	Another BIRD dives from above and... SKIT... takes a chunk

	out of Rosie's cheek.

				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)

			AAAH ! YOU FUCKER !

				CHRIS

			(From above) You alright?

				RODRIGUEZ

			Yeah. I'm cool. I'm... cool.

	Rosie keeps FIRING. The deafening SOUND of her M-16 keeps

	her from hearing a...

	...KRATTCH...in the sheet-metal wall. A second later...

	...RRRRRIPPP! The metal is torn open like tissue-paper.

	SOMETHING dark lunges from the opening. It's the surviving

	HUNTER! One of its steel claws GRABS the chain-drive. The

	mechanism stops dead.

	QUICK CUTS: of THE ESCAPEES slipping, nearly falling, as they

	hang on to the chain.

				REBECCA

			I thought it wasn't supposed to stop.

				ADA

			Climb out. OUT!

	Rebecca has nearly reached Level "A"... She's able to hoist

	herself up, and roll to safety.

	Ada tries to climb. The chain is GREASY. Her hands slip.

	BELOW, the Hunter lets go of the mechanism. The chain JERKS.

	The escapees nearly lose their balance again.

	Rosie, at the bottom, is being lifted toward the Hunter's

	free hand. She JUMPS down. Barely catching the next set

	of prongs beneath her.

	AT THE TOP, Ada reaches Level "A". Rebecca catches her and

	pulls her up onto Level "A..

	Jill is next, rising slowly. Rebecca and Ada reach down and

	grab her arms just as... TCHUNG... the mechanism stops again.

	The Hunter has grabbed the chain again. Its free hand

	swings, clutching at Rosie, who crouches, avoiding capture.

	Pg-90

	Jill is pulled to safety. She turns and reaches down for

	Chris, who starts to climb the chain, his hands slipping on

	the grease.

				CHRIS

			ROSIE!?

				RODRIGUEZ

			I'M ALRIGHT!

	She's not alright. She's trapped. She can't get up past

	the Hunter. She FIRES at the thing. Bullets BOUNCE off its

	protective steel under-hide.

	Chris climbs three feet. Slides back two. The others reach

	down from above. Their hands come within inches, but can't

	quite catch hold of him.

				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)

			Here! Here, you... lizard. You

			fuckin' cockroach, HERE!

	Straining to reach Rosie, the hunter lets go of the chain

	for a second, then latches on again. That second lifts

	Chris to within reach of Jill and the others. They grab

	his arms. Lift him up.

	That second has also brought Rosie within reach of the

	Hunter. Its claws COMB her hair as she tries to duck lower

	while keeping her balance on the prongs.

	THWAKK! SOMETHING crashes through the wall. A MONSTROUS

	CLAW that IMPALES the Hunter. It's the claw of THE TYRANT!

	The chain mechanism begins to rise again. Rosie, cringing,

	is lifted past the monster just as it leans its head and

	shoulders into the shaft to examine what it has caught.

	Disappointed, the Tyrant SCRAPES the Hunter off its claw.

	It drops away down the shaft.

	The Tyrant turns its CLICKING, dilating eyes up at Rosie,

	and...TCHUNNNGG...purposely STOPS the rising chain.

				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)

			(Calling up) BAD NEWS, GUYS. THIS

			THING'S NOT SO STUPID!

				CHRIS

			(From above) Climb, Rosie!

				ROSIE

			No. I'm finished. I live here now.

				CHRIS

			ROSIE, NOOOOO!

	Pg-91

	Rosie DIVES off the prongs...directly at the Tyrant. With

	another lightning move, the monster catches her in its bionic

	claw, crushing her ribs. With BLOOD spurting from her mouth,

	she utters her last words...

				ROSIE

			EAT ME, YOU PILE OF SHIT!

	INT   LEVEL "A"   TIMELESS

	ADA is the most pragmatic.

				ADA

			Come.

				CHRIS

			ROSIE ...

				ADA

			COME! You convinced me that there

			were...larger matters. We're at the

			top. You said you'd get us out.

	Ada's words snap Chris back into the urgency of their

	situation. He struggles to his feet.

				CHRIS

			Th-this way.

	They are in the MANSION, which Chris knows well. He leads

	his small troop into...

	INT   POWDER ROOM   TIMELESS

	...a small powder room, decorated garishly in an East Indian

	motif. A ceramic TIGER'S HEAD sits atop a vanity. CHRIS

	grabs it...and TWISTS it on a pivot. A PANEL spins. The

	COMMODE disappears into the wall, opening a SECRET PASSAGE.

				REBECCA

			Hell of a shit-house.

				JILL

			The guy was a bootlegger... with

			a sense of humor.

	Chris leads the other into...

	INT   CLOCK ROOM   TIMELESS

	...a small, blank CHAMBER. The only thing it holds is a

	GRANDFATHER CLOCK .

	Pg-92

				CHRIS

			I hope they haven't disabled this.

	CHRIS opens the door that covers the clock face. He quickly

	spins the hands until they hit... HIGH NOON.

	GRONNNK! A WALL begins to GRIND open, straining against

	rust, dirt, from years of idleness. Cobwebs are pulled

	apart and...DAYLIGHT APPEARS!

				CHRIS (cont.)

			Alright. We made it.

	Chris urges the OTHERS out through the opening. At the same

	time he checks the detonator. The LED is down to SIX MINUTES

	and counting.

	INT   HUEY   DAY

	At the controls of his helicopter, LAGUARDIA spots something.

	EXT   MANSION   HUEY'S POV   DAY

	REBECCA, then ADA, then JILL climbing onto the lawn.

	INT   HUEY   DAY

				LAGUARDIA

			I'm goin' in.

				RADIO MAN

			You don't have authority.

				LAGUARDIA

			Fuck authority.

	EXT   MANSION   YARD   DAY

	...CHRIS climbs out of the secret exit. THE OTHERS, having

	spotted the incoming chopper, are waving at it. There's a

	sense of relief, of salvation. Only Chris notices...

	...a bit of PLASTER falling away from one of the mansion's

	stone walls.

				CHRIS

			Watch it. WATCH IIIIT!

	KER-AAAASSSSHHH! THE TYRANT BURSTS through the wall. With

	superhuman speed, it ATTACKS the escapees, who run, dodge,

	barely escaping the WHISHING SWIPE of its iron claw.

	Pg-93

	INT   HUEY   DAY

				RADIO

			What in God's name is that thing!

				LAGUARDIA

			Somethin' we weren't supposed to

			see. Drop the ladder. And drop

			the Stinger.

	EXT   MANSION   YARD   DAY

	THE HUEY swoops down as low as safety will allow. A faceted

	aluminum LADDER unfurls.

				CHRIS

			GET UP!

	CHRIS pushes JILL toward the ladder. She pulls on Ada's arm

	and sends her up first. ADA begins to climb. Then REBECCA.

	The Tyrant closes in, SWIPING at Chris, who just manages to

	avoid the SLICE of its mighty claw.

	The RADIO MAN leans out of the door above, holding something.

				RADIO MAN

			Catch this!

	Chris doesn't hear. Jill does.

				JILL

			Toss it to me!

	The radio man drops the Stinger...a rocket with a shoulder-

	launcher.. .down into Jill's hands.

	Chris hits the dirt. The Tyrant tries to crush him by

	stepping on him. Chris rolls away.

	The ladder is too wobbly. Jill can't be sure of launching

	an accurate shot.

				JILL (cont.)

			CHRIS!

	Chris looks up. Sees Jill holding the rocket launcher. He

	RUNS past the Tyrant, okey-doking, left, right, then dodging

	left again. The monster SWIPES at him with its elongated

	claw. Chris' flack-jacket is caught. Protective fibers fly.

	But Chris escapes without injury.

	Pg-94

	Jill pitches the weapon. Chris catches it. The Tyrant is

	on him, about to STOMP him with a bionic FOOT when...

	...Chris aims at the monster's rhinoceros heart and FIRES!

	The rocket CONNECTS, on target. The casing around the animal

	heart EXPLODES... and the Tyrant drops like a giant Redwood...

	...on top of Chris's legs.

	As Chris tries to free himself, he checks the detonator.

	THREE MINUTES. TWO-FIFTY-NINE. EIGHT. SEVEN. SIX.

	LaGuardia drops his chopper a bit lower. The bottom of the

	ladder hits the ground, coming within Chris' reach. He grabs

	on. The helicopter rises again. Chris is pulled out from

	under the Tyrant's steel body and is LIFTED into the air.

	He climbs frantically.

	Above him, Jill is still on the ladder as well. Ada and

	Rebecca pull her up. Chris DANGLES as the Huey banks away

	over the forest. The tops of TREES whip his legs, but he

	hangs on, climbing up... up... until the others catch his

	hands and hoist him into the chopper. Chris checks the LED.

	ONE MINUTE, FORTY-FIVE SECONDS.

				JILL

			(Reading over Chris' shoulder) We

			have to get out of range.

				CHRIS

			No. (To the pilot) Circle around.

				LAGUARDIA

			Are there more survivors?

				CHRIS

			No. Just...circle, okay? I want

			to...take a last look.

	The Huey banks into a circle. Chris looks down at...

	EXT   AERIAL POV   DAY

	...the MANSION. And just over the hills...HIS FARM.

	INT   HUEY   DAY

				JILL

			It's... your home.

	CHRIS looks at her, with a resigned smile.

	Pg-95

				CHRIS

			I hoped... it would be our home.

				JILL

			I guess... we're gonna be moving.

	Chris checks the LED. THIRTY-EIGHT SECONDS.

				CHRIS

			(To the pilot) Full throttle.

			Out of here, man!

	LaGuardia pushes his stick. The Huey LUNGES forward at

	top speed. REBECCA, ADA and JILL are pressed back by

	inertia. Chris holds himself erect. Through the window,

	in the receding sky, he spots...

	...AN EAGLE, riding the wind.

	CUT TO:

	EXT   THE ARKLEY FOREST   THE MANSION   DAY

	PLOOOOMMMMM! The GROUND ERUPTS from an enormous under-

	ground explosion. The MANSION is reduced to particulate

	as the shock-wave spreads outward.

	EXT   FARM   DAY

	Chris' farm hand, RAKE, is shambling out of the house, a

	ZOMBIE... when the EXPLOSIVE FORCE HITS, tearing him APART.

	EXT   RACCOON CITY   DAY

	The TOWN is EMPTY...except for NINE LONELY FIGURES, lumbering

	down Main Street. They, too...are ZOMBIES. The hot wave

	HITS. Two are VAPORIZED. FIRE engulfs two more. The BRAINS

	of two others are DESTROYED by flying debris.. .

	...which catches the remaining three, as well. Arms are

	torn off. Iron shafts from shattered plumbing, shards of

	window glass, slats from picket fences... PUNCH through

	necks, chests, bellies...

	...but the dead things, their skulls undamaged,

	through billows of dust... drooling hungrily.

	THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.
