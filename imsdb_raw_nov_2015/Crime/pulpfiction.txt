               INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING

               A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. 

               It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, 

               there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching 

               on bacon and eating eggs.

               Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The 

               Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, 

               like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're 

               going out of style.

               It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or 

               how old she is; everything she does contradicts something 

               she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is 

               to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm 

                         through doin' that shit.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         You always say that, the same thing 

                         every time: never again, I'm through, 

                         too dangerous.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         I know that's what I always say. I'm 

                         always right too, but 

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                          but you forget about it in a day 

                         or two -

                                     YOUNG MAN

                          yeah, well, the days of me 

                         forgittin' are over, and the days of 

                         me rememberin' have just begun.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         When you go on like this, you know 

                         what you sound like?

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         I sound like a sensible fucking man, 

                         is what I sound like.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         You sound like a duck.

                              (imitates a duck)

                         Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, 

                         quack, quack...

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         Well take heart, 'cause you're never 

                         gonna hafta hear it again. Because 

                         since I'm never gonna do it again, 

                         you're never gonna hafta hear me 

                         quack about how I'm never gonna do 

                         it again.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         After tonight.

               The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in 

               there, back and forth.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                              (with a smile)

                         Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

               A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

                                     WAITRESS

                         Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         Oh yes, thank you.

               The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man 

               lights up another cigarette.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         I'm doin' fine.

               The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his 

               smoke.

               The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her 

               coffee.

               The Young Man goes right back into it.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         I mean the way it is now, you're 

                         takin' the same fuckin' risk as when 

                         you rob a bank. You take more of a 

                         risk. Banks are easier!  Federal 

                         banks aren't supposed to stop you 

                         anyway, during a robbery. They're 

                         insured, why should they care? You 

                         don't even need a gun in a federal 

                         bank. I heard about this guy, walked 

                         into a federal bank with a portable 

                         phone, handed the phone to the teller, 

                         the guy on the other end of the phone 

                         said: "We got this guy's little girl, 

                         and if you don't give him all your 

                         money, we're gonna kill 'er."

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         Did it work?

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm 

                         talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in 

                         a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, 

                         not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, 

                         cleans the place out, and they don't 

                         lift a fuckin' finger.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         Did they hurt the little girl?

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         I don't know. There probably never 

                         was a little girl  the point of the 

                         story isn't the little girl. The 

                         point of the story is they robbed 

                         the bank with a telephone.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         You wanna rob banks?

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, 

                         I'm just illustrating that if we 

                         did, it would be easier than what we 

                         been doin'.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         So you don't want to be a bank robber?

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         Naw, all those guys are goin' down 

                         the same road, either dead or servin' 

                         twenty.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         And no more liquor stores?

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         What have we been talking about? 

                         Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, 

                         it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too 

                         many foreigners own liquor stores. 

                         Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't 

                         fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: 

                         "Empty out the register," and they 

                         don't know what it fuckin' means. 

                         They make it too personal. We keep 

                         on, one of those gook motherfuckers' 

                         gonna make us kill 'em.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         I'm not gonna kill anybody.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         I don't wanna kill anybody either. 

                         But they'll probably put us in a 

                         situation where it's us of them. And 

                         if it's not the gooks, it these old 

                         Jews who've owned the store for 

                         fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got 

                         Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the 

                         counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try 

                         walkin' into one of those stores 

                         with nothin' but a telephone, see 

                         how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget 

                         it, we're out of it.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         Well, what else is there, day jobs?

                                     YOUNG MAN

                              (laughing)

                         Not this life.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         Well what then?

               He calls to the Waitress.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         Garcon! Coffee!

               Then looks to his girl.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         This place.

               The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

                                     WAITRESS

                              (snotty)

                         "Garcon" means boy.

               She splits.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         Here? It's a coffee shop.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         What's wrong with that? People never 

                         rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor 

                         stores, gas stations, you get your 

                         head blown off stickin' up one of 

                         them. Restaurants, on the other hand, 

                         you catch with their pants down. 

                         They're not expecting to get robbed, 

                         or not as expecting.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                              (taking to idea)

                         I bet in places like this you could 

                         cut down on the hero factor.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         Correct. Just like banks, these places 

                         are insured. The managers don't give 

                         a fuck, they're just tryin' to get 

                         ya out the door before you start 

                         pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget 

                         it, they ain't takin' a bullet for 

                         the register. Busboys, some wetback 

                         gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour 

                         gonna really give a fuck you're 

                         stealin' from the owner. Customers 

                         are sittin' there with food in their 

                         mouths, they don't know what's goin' 

                         on. One minute they're havin' a Denver 

                         omelet, next minute somebody's 

                         stickin' a gun in their face.

               The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man 

               continues in a low voice.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         See, I got the idea last liquor store 

                         we stuck up. 'Member all those 

                         customers kept comin' in?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         Yeah.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         Then you got the idea to take 

                         everybody's wallet.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         Uh-huh.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         That was a good idea.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         Thanks.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         We made more from the wallets then 

                         we did the register.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         Yes we did.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         A lot of people go to restaurants.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         A lot of wallets.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         Pretty smart, huh?

               The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new 

               information.

               She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The 

               tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the 

               motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the 

               COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's 

               face.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         Pretty smart.

                              (into it)

                         I'm ready, let's go, right here, 

                         right now.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         Remember, same as before, you're 

                         crowd control, I handle the employees.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         Got it.

               They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on 

               the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN

                         I love you, Pumpkin.

                                     YOUNG MAN

                         I love you, Honey Bunny.

               And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, 

               stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona 

               is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is 

               that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

                                     PUMPKIN

                              (yelling to all)

                         Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

                                     HONEY BUNNY

                         Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 

                         I'll execute every one of you 

                         motherfuckers!  Got that?

               INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING)  MORNING

               An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS 

               down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front 

               seat are two young fellas  one white, one black  both 

               wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long 

               green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES 

               WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

                                     JULES

                          Okay now, tell me about the hash 

                         bars?

                                     VINCENT

                         What so you want to know?

                                     JULES

                         Well, hash is legal there, right?

                                     VINCENT

                         Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a 

                         hundred percent legal. I mean you 

                         can't walk into a restaurant, roll a 

                         joint, and start puffin' away. You're 

                         only supposed to smoke in your home 

                         or certain designated places.

                                     JULES

                         Those are hash bars?

                                     VINCENT

                         Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's 

                         legal to buy it, it's legal to own 

                         it and, if you're the proprietor of 

                         a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. 

                         It's legal to carry it, which doesn't 

                         really matter 'cause  get a load of 

                         this  if the cops stop you, it's 

                         illegal for this to search you. 

                         Searching you is a right that the 

                         cops in Amsterdam don't have.

                                     JULES

                         That did it, man  I'm fuckin' goin', 

                         that's all there is to it.

                                     VINCENT

                         You'll dig it the most. But you know 

                         what the funniest thing about Europe 

                         is?

                                     JULES

                         What?

                                     VINCENT

                         It's the little differences. A lotta 

                         the same shit we got here, they got 

                         there, but there they're a little 

                         different.

                                     JULES

                         Examples?

                                     VINCENT

                         Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer 

                         in a movie theatre. And I don't mean 

                         in a paper cup either. They give you 

                         a glass of beer, like in a bar. In 

                         Paris, you can buy beer at 

                         MacDonald's. Also, you know what 

                         they call a Quarter Pounder with 

                         Cheese in Paris?

                                     JULES

                         They don't call it a Quarter Pounder 

                         with Cheese?

                                     VINCENT

                         No, they got the metric system there, 

                         they wouldn't know what the fuck a 

                         Quarter Pounder is.

                                     JULES

                         What'd they call it?

                                     VINCENT

                         Royale with Cheese.

                                     JULES

                              (repeating)

                         Royale with Cheese. What'd they call 

                         a Big Mac?

                                     VINCENT

                         Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call 

                         it Le Big Mac.

                                     JULES

                         Le Big Mac. What do they call a 

                         Whopper?

                                     VINCENT

                         I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger 

                         King.  But you know what they put on 

                         french fries in Holland instead of 

                         ketchup?

                                     JULES

                         What?

                                     VINCENT

                         Mayonnaise.

                                     JULES

                         Goddamn!

                                     VINCENT

                         I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a 

                         little bit on the side of the plate, 

                         they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

                                     JULES

                         Uuccch!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHEVY (TRUNK)  MORNING

               The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach 

               inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking 

               them.

                                     JULES

                         We should have shotguns for this 

                         kind of deal.

                                     VINCENT

                         How many up there?

                                     JULES

                         Three or four.

                                     VINCENT

                         Counting our guy?

                                     JULES

                         I'm not sure.

                                     VINCENT

                         So there could be five guys up there?

                                     JULES

                         It's possible.

                                     VINCENT

                         We should have fuckin' shotguns.

               They CLOSE the trunk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD  MORNING

               Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically 

               dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what 

               looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

               We TRACK alongside.

                                     VINCENT

                         What's her name?

                                     JULES

                         Mia.

                                     VINCENT

                         How did Marsellus and her meet?

                                     JULES

                         I dunno, however people meet people. 

                         She usta be an actress.

                                     VINCENT

                         She ever do anything I woulda saw?

                                     JULES

                         I think her biggest deal was she 

                         starred in a pilot.

                                     VINCENT

                         What's a pilot?

                                     JULES

                         Well, you know the shows on TV?

                                     VINCENT

                         I don't watch TV.

                                     JULES

                         Yes, but you're aware that there's 

                         an invention called television, and 

                         on that invention they show shows?

                                     VINCENT

                         Yeah.

                                     JULES

                         Well, the way they pick the shows on 

                         TV is they make one show, and that 

                         show's called a pilot. And they show 

                         that one show to the people who pick 

                         the shows, and on the strength of 

                         that one show, they decide if they 

                         want to make more shows. Some get 

                         accepted and become TV programs, and 

                         some don't, and become nothing. She 

                         starred in one of the ones that became 

                         nothing.

               They enter the apartment building.

               INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING)  MORNING

               Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait 

               for the elevator.

                                     JULES

                         You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-

                         black, half-Samoan, usta call him 

                         Tony Rocky Horror.

                                     VINCENT

                         Yeah maybe, fat right?

                                     JULES

                         I wouldn't go so far as to call the 

                         brother fat. He's got a weight 

                         problem.  What's the nigger gonna 

                         do, he's Samoan.

                                     VINCENT

                         I think I know who you mean, what 

                         about him?

                                     JULES

                         Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up 

                         good.  And word around the campfire, 

                         it was on account of Marsellus 

                         Wallace's wife.

               The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

               INT. ELEVATOR  MORNING

                                     VINCENT

                         What'd he do, fuck her?

                                     JULES

                         No no no no no no no, nothin' that 

                         bad.

                                     VINCENT

                         Well what then?

                                     JULES

                         He gave her a foot massage.

                                     VINCENT

                         A foot massage?

               Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                     VINCENT

                         That's all?

               Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                     VINCENT

                         What did Marsellus do?

                                     JULES

                         Sent a couple of guys over to his 

                         place.  They took him out on the 

                         patio of his apartment, threw his 

                         ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell 

                         four stories. They had this garden 

                         at the bottom, enclosed in glass, 

                         like one of them greenhouses  nigger 

                         fell through that. Since then, he's 

                         kinda developed a speech impediment.

               The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

                                     VINCENT

                         That's a damn shame.

               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY  MORNING

               STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline 

               down the hall.

                                     VINCENT

                         Still I hafta say, play with matches, 

                         ya get burned.

                                     JULES

                         Whaddya mean?

                                     VINCENT

                         You don't be givin' Marsellus 

                         Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

                                     JULES

                         You don't think he overreacted?

                                     VINCENT

                         Antwan probably didn't expect 

                         Marsellus to react like he did, but 

                         he had to expect a reaction.

                                     JULES

                         It was a foot massage, a foot massage 

                         is nothing, I give my mother a foot 

                         massage.

                                     VINCENT

                         It's laying hands on Marsellus 

                         Wallace's new wife in a familiar 

                         way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out 

                          no, but you're in the same fuckin' 

                         ballpark.

               Jules stops Vincent.

                                     JULES

                         Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right 

                         there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' 

                         a bitch a foot massage ain't even 

                         the same fuckin' thing.

                                     VINCENT

                         Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

                                     JULES

                         It ain't no ballpark either. Look 

                         maybe your method of massage differs 

                         from mine, but touchin' his lady's 

                         feet, and stickin' your tongue in 

                         her holyiest of holyies, ain't the 

                         same ballpark, ain't the same league, 

                         ain't even the same fuckin' sport.

                         Foot massages don't mean shit.

                                     VINCENT

                         Have you ever given a foot massage?

                                     JULES

                         Don't be tellin' me about foot 

                         massages  I'm the foot fuckin' 

                         master.

                                     VINCENT

                         Given a lot of 'em?

                                     JULES

                         Shit yeah. I got my technique down 

                         man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

                                     VINCENT

                         Have you ever given a guy a foot 

                         massage?

               Jules looks at him a long moment  he's been set up.

                                     JULES

                         Fuck you.

               He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a 

               little bit behind.

                                     VINCENT

                         How many?

                                     JULES

                         Fuck you.

                                     VINCENT

                         Would you give me a foot massage  

                         I'm kinda tired.

                                     JULES

                         Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' 

                         pissed  this is the door.

               The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They 

               whisper.

                                     JULES

                         What time is it?

                                     VINCENT

                              (checking his watch)

                         Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

                                     JULES

                         It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

               They move a little away from the door, facing each other, 

               still whispering.

                                     JULES

                         Look, just because I wouldn't give 

                         no man a foot massage, don't make it 

                         right for Marsellus to throw Antwan 

                         off a building into a glass-

                         motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the 

                         way the nigger talks. That ain't 

                         right, man. Motherfucker do that to 

                         me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause 

                         I'd kill'a motherfucker.

                                     VINCENT

                         I'm not sayin' he was right, but 

                         you're sayin' a foot massage don't 

                         mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. 

                         I've given a million ladies a million 

                         foot massages and they all meant 

                         somethin'. We act like they don't, 

                         but they do. That's what's so fuckin' 

                         cool about 'em. This sensual thing's 

                         goin' on that nobody's talkin about, 

                         but you know it and she knows it, 

                         fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan 

                         shoulda known fuckin' better. That's 

                         his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna 

                         have a sense of humor about that 

                         shit.

                                     JULES

                         That's an interesting point, but 

                         let's get into character.

                                     VINCENT

                         What's her name again?

                                     JULES

                         Mia. Why you so interested in big 

                         man's wife?

                                     VINCENT

                         Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida 

                         and when he's gone, he wants me to 

                         take care of Mia.

                                     JULES

                         Take care of her?

               Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

                                     VINCENT

                         Not that! Take her out. Show her a 

                         good time. Don't let her get lonely.

                                     JULES

                         You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace 

                         out on a date?

                                     VINCENT

                         It ain't a date. It's like when you 

                         and your buddy's wife go to a movie 

                         or somethin'. It's just... you know... 

                         good company.

               Jules just looks at him.

                                     VINCENT

                         It's not a date.

               Jules just looks at him.

               INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49)  MORNING

               THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a 

               table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

               One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to 

               REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

                                     JULES

                         Hey kids.

               The two men stroll inside.

               The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

               MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the 

               scene progresses, back into the corner.

               ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of 

               Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the 

               table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

               BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

               Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in 

               their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

                                     JULES

                         How you boys doin'?

               No answer.

                                     JULES

                              (to Brett)

                         Am I trippin', or did I just ask you 

                         a question.

                                     BRETT

                         We're doin' okay.

               As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

                                     JULES

                         Do you know who we are?

               Brett shakes his head: "No."

                                     JULES

                         We're associates of your business 

                         partner Marsellus Wallace, you 

                         remember your business partner 

                         dont'ya?

               No answer.

                                     JULES

                              (to Brett)

                         Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: 

                         you're Brett, right?

                                     BRETT

                         I'm Brett.

                                     JULES

                         I thought so. Well, you remember 

                         your business partner Marsellus 

                         Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

                                     BRETT

                         I remember him.

                                     JULES

                         Good for you. Looks like me and 

                         Vincent caught you at breakfast, 

                         sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

                                     BRETT

                         Hamburgers.

                                     JULES

                         Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any 

                         nutritious breakfast. What kinda 

                         hamburgers?

                                     BRETT

                         Cheeseburgers.

                                     JULES

                         No, I mean where did you get'em?

                         MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-

                         Box, where?

                                     BRETT

                         Big Kahuna Burger.

                                     JULES

                         Big Kahuna Burger. That's that 

                         Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they 

                         got some tasty burgers. I ain't never 

                         had one myself, how are they?

                                     BRETT

                         They're good.

                                     JULES

                         Mind if I try one of yours?

                                     BRETT

                         No.

                                     JULES

                         Yours is this one, right?

                                     BRETT

                         Yeah.

               Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

                                     JULES

                         Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.

                              (to Vincent)

                         Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna 

                         Burger?

                                     VINCENT

                         No.

               Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

                                     JULES

                         You wanna bite, they're real good.

                                     VINCENT

                         I ain't hungry.

                                     JULES

                         Well, if you like hamburgers give 

                         'em a try sometime. Me, I can't 

                         usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's 

                         a vegetarian. Which more or less 

                         makes me a vegetarian, but I sure 

                         love the taste of a good burger.

                              (to Brett)

                         You know what they call a Quarter 

                         Pounder with Cheese in France?

                                     BRETT

                         No.

                                     JULES

                         Tell 'em, Vincent.

                                     VINCENT

                         Royale with Cheese.

                                     JULES

                         Royale with Cheese, you know why 

                         they call it that?

                                     BRETT

                         Because of the metric system?

                                     JULES

                         Check out the big brain on Brett. 

                         You'a smart motherfucker, that's 

                         right. The metric system.

                              (he points to a fast 

                              food drink cup)

                         What's in this?

                                     BRETT

                         Sprite.

                                     JULES

                         Sprite, good, mind if I have some of 

                         your tasty beverage to wash this 

                         down with?

                                     BRETT

                         Sure.

               Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

                                     JULES

                         Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!

                              (to Roger)

                         You, Flock of Seagulls, you know 

                         what we're here for?

               Roger nods his head: "Yes."

                                     JULES

                         Then why don't you tell my boy here 

                         Vince, where you got the shit hid.

                                     MARVIN

                         It's under the be 

                                     JULES

                          I don't remember askin' you a 

                         goddamn thing.

                              (to Roger)

                         You were sayin'?

                                     ROGER

                         It's under the bed.

               Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out 

               a black snap briefcase.

                                     VINCENT

                         Got it.

               Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see 

               what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent 

               just stares at it, transfixed.

                                     JULES

                         We happy?

               No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

                                     JULES

                         Vincent!

               Vincent looks up at Jules.

                                     JULES

                         We happy?

               Closing the case.

                                     VINCENT

                         We're happy.

                                     BRETT

                              (to Jules)

                         Look, what's your name? I got his 

                         name's Vincent, but what's yours?

                                     JULES

                         My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' 

                         your ass outta this shit.

                                     BRETT

                         I just want you to know how sorry we 

                         are about how fucked up things got 

                         between us and Mr. Wallace. When we 

                         entered into this thing, we only had 

                         the best intentions 

               As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger 

               three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

               Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

               Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering, 

               but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

                                     JULES

                              (to Brett)

                         Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your 

                         concentration? I didn't mean to do 

                         that.  Please, continue. I believe 

                         you were saying something about "best 

                         intentions."

               Brett can't say a word.

                                     JULES

                         Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through 

                         anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would 

                         you describe for me what Marsellus 

                         Wallace looks like?

               Brett still can't speak.

               Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing 

               the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits 

               in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in 

               front of an interrogator.

                                     JULES

                         What country you from!

                                     BRETT

                              (petrified)

                         What?

                                     JULES

                         "What" ain't no country I know! Do 

                         they speak English in "What?"

                                     BRETT

                              (near heart attack)

                         What?

                                     JULES

                         English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-

                         it?

                                     BRETT

                         Yes.

                                     JULES

                         Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

                                     BRETT

                         Yes.

                                     JULES

                         Now describe what Marsellus Wallace 

                         looks like!

                                     BRETT

                              (out of fear)

                         What?

               Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's 

               cheek.

                                     JULES

                         Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What" 

                         again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya 

                         motherfucker, say "What" one more 

                         goddamn time!

               Brett is regressing on the spot.

                                     JULES

                         Now describe to me what Marsellus 

                         Wallace looks like!

               Brett does his best.

                                     BRETT

                         Well he's... he's... black 

                                     JULES

                          go on!

                                     BRETT

                         ...and he's... he's... bald 

                                     JULES

                          does he look like a bitch?!

                                     BRETT

                              (without thinking)

                         What?

               Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his 

               eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

               Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in 

               the chair.

                                     JULES

                         Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

                                     BRETT

                              (in agony)

                         No.

                                     JULES

                         Then why did you try to fuck 'im 

                         like a bitch?!

                                     BRETT

                              (in spasm)

                         I didn't.

               Now in a lower voice.

                                     JULES

                         Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 

                         'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

                                     BRETT

                              (in spasm)

                         Yes.

                                     JULES

                         There's a passage I got memorized, 

                         seems appropriate for this situation: 

                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 

                         righteous man is beset on all sides 

                         by the inequities of the selfish and 

                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 

                         he who, in the name of charity and 

                         good will, shepherds the weak through 

                         the valley of darkness, for he is 

                         truly his brother's keeper and the 

                         finder of lost children. And I will 

                         strike down upon thee with great 

                         vengeance and furious anger those 

                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 

                         brothers. And you will know my name 

                         is the Lord when I lay my vengeance 

                         upon you."

               The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting 

               Brett.

               AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

                       "VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE"

               FADE IN:

               MEDIUM SHOT  BUTCH COOLIDGE

               We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old 

               prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue 

               high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is 

               everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds 

               like a cross between a gangster and a king.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)

                         I think you're gonna find  when all 

                         this shit is over and done  I think

                         life, but it's a fact of life your 

                         ass is gonna hafta git realistic 

                         about. This business is filled to 

                         the brim with unrealistic 

                         motherfuckers who thought their ass 

                         aged like wine.  Besides, even if 

                         you went all the way, what would you 

                         be? Feather-weight champion of the 

                         world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you 

                         can even get a credit card based on 

                         that.

               A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front 

               of Butch. Butch picks it up.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)

                         Now the night of the fight, you may 

                         fell a slight sting, that's pride 

                         fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride 

                         only hurts, it never helps. Fight 

                         through that shit. 'Cause a year

                                     BUTCH

                         I got no problem with that.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)

                         In the fifth, your ass goes down.

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)

                         Say it!

                                     BUTCH

                         In the fifth, my ass goes down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR (MOVING)  DAY

               Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 

               cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio, 

               ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

               EXT. SALLY LEROY'S  DAY

               Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus 

               owns.

               Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking 

               lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

               Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked, 

               revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE. 

               Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin 

               Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally 

               LeRoy's.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE

                         Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, 

                         git your ass on in here.

               Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between 

               Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door 

               in our faces.

               INT. SALLY LEROY'S  DAY

               The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave 

               crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

                                     VINCENT

                         Where's the big man?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE

                         He's over there, finishing up some 

                         business.

               VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with 

               his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of 

               yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)

                         Hang back for a second or two, and 

                         when you see the white boy leave, go 

                         on over.  In the meanwhile, can I 

                         make you an espresso?

                                     VINCENT

                         How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' 

                         American?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE

                         Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia 

                         out tomorrow?

                                     VINCENT

                         At Marsellus' request.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE

                         Have you met Mia?

                                     VINCENT

                         Not yet.

               English Dave smiles to himself.

                                     VINCENT

                         What's so funny?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE

                         Not a goddamn thing.

                                     VINCENT

                         Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big 

                         man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit 

                         across a table, chew my food with my 

                         mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and 

                         that's all I'm gonna do.

               English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE

                         My name's Paul, and this is between 

                         y'all.

               Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his 

               cup of "Plain ol' American."

                                     BUTCH

                              (to English Dave)

                         Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE

                         Filters?

                                     BUTCH

                         Non.

               While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his 

               coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

                                     BUTCH

                         Lookin' at somethin', friend?

                                     VINCENT

                         I ain't your friend, palooka.

               Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

                                     BUTCH

                         What was that?

                                     VINCENT

                         I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

               Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)

                         Vincent Vega has entered the building, 

                         git your ass over here!

               Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another 

               glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME, 

               looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching 

               business.

               BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure 

               that is Marsellus.

               Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend 

               of Marsellus, he better let it go  for now.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)

                         Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

               Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays 

               English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN)  NIGHT

               CLOSEUP  JODY

               A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of 

               her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in 

               her lips, eyebrows and nose.

                                     JODY

                         ...I'll lend it to you. It's a great 

                         book on body piercing.

               Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen 

               table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is 

               at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

                                     TRUDI

                         You know how they use that gun when 

                         they pierce your ears? They don't 

                         use that when they pierce your 

                         nipples, do they?

                                     JODY

                         Forget that gun. That gun goes against 

                         the entire idea behind piercing. All 

                         of my piercing, sixteen places on my 

                         body, every one of 'em done with a 

                         needle. Five in each ear. One through 

                         the nipple on my left breast. One 

                         through my right nostril.  One through 

                         my left eyebrow. One through my lip. 

                         One in my clit. And I wear a stud in 

                         my tongue.

               Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear 

               and out the other, until that last remark.

                                     VINCENT

                              (interrupting)

                         Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm 

                         curious, why would you get a stud in 

                         your tongue?

               Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious 

               thing in the world.

                                     JODY

                         It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

               That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it 

               makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent 

               to ponder the truth of her statement.

               INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

               appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly 

               personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult 

               life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and 

               has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a 

               "Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

               Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

               Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

               Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two 

               continue to talk, Vince shoots up.

               EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S  NIGHT

               In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over 

               L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're 

               all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book, 

               Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, 

               saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the 

               Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and 

               over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

               But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's 

               diners.

               Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of 

               view.

               Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with 

               a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a 

               red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath 

               the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that 

               is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

                                     VINCENT

                         What the fuck is this place?

                                     MIA

                         This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis 

                         man should love it.

                                     VINCENT

                         Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

                                     MIA

                         You can get a steak here, daddy-o. 

                         Don't be a...

               Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on 

               the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

                                     VINCENT

                         After you, kitty-cat.

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S  NIGHT

               Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint 

               English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over 

               the wall

               ("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF 

               THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that 

               the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s 

               cars.

               In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign 

               on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers 

               (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or 

               barefeet.

               The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, 

               B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The 

               WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: 

               MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and 

               LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing 

               appropriate costumes.

               Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red 

               '59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting 

               a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing 

               you please me."

                                     BUDDY

                         Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

                                     VINCENT

                         I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

                                     BUDDY

                         How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, 

                         or bloody as hell?

                         Bloody as hell. And to drink, a 

                         vanilla coke.

                                     BUDDY

                                     MIA

                         I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger  

                         bloody  and a five-dollar shake.

                                     BUDDY

                         How d'ya want that shake, Martin and 

                         Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

                         shake?

                                     MIA

                                     VINCENT

                         A shake? Milk and ice cream?

                                     MIA

                         Uh-huh.

                         It costs five dollars?

                                     BUDDY

                         Yep.

                                     VINCENT

                         You don't put bourbon in it or 

                         anything?

                                     BUDDY

                         Nope.

                                     VINCENT

                         Just checking.

               Buddy exits.

               Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are 

               dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, 

               and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, 

               The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her 

               customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a 

               fool.

                                     MIA

                         Whaddya think?

                                     VINCENT

                         It's like a wax museum with a pulse 

                         rate.

               Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling 

               himself a smoke.

               After a second of watching him 

                                     MIA

                         What are you doing?

                         It's just tobacco.

                                     MIA

                         Oh. Well in that case, will you roll 

                         me one, cowboy?

               As he finishes licking it 

                                     VINCENT

                         You can have this one, cowgirl.

               He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to 

               her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's 

               hand. He lights it.

                                     MIA

                         Thanks.

                                     VINCENT

                         Think nothing of it.

               He begins rolling one for himself.

               As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, 

               making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a 

               square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS 

               the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out 

               a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

               Back to Mia and Vincent.

                                     MIA

                         Marsellus said you just got back 

                         from Amsterdam.

                                     VINCENT

                         Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

                                     MIA

                         That was my fifteen minutes.

                                     VINCENT

                         What was it?

                                     MIA

                         It was show about a team of female 

                         secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

                                     VINCENT

                         What?

                                     MIA

                         "Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a 

                         bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in 

                         we're a force to be reckoned with. 

                         Five, as in there's one... two ... 

                         three... four... five of us. There 

                         was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal 

                         from that show "Baton Rouge," she 

                         was the leader. A Japanese one, a 

                         black one, a French one and a brunette 

                         one, me.  We all had special skills. 

                         Sommerset had a photographic memory, 

                         the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, 

                         the black girl was a demolition 

                         expert, the French fox' specialty 

                         was sex...

                                     VINCENT

                         What was your specialty?

                                     MIA

                         Knives. The character I played, Raven 

                         McCoy, her background was she was 

                         raised by circus performers. So she 

                         grew up doing a knife act. According 

                         to the show, she was the deadliest 

                         woman in the world with a knife. But 

                         because she grew up in a circus, she 

                         was also something of an acrobat. 

                         She could do illusions, she was a 

                         trapeze artist  when you're keeping 

                         the world safe from evil, you never 

                         know when being a trapeze artist's 

                         gonna come in handy. And she knew a 

                         zillion old jokes her grandfather, 

                         an old vaudevillian, taught her. If 

                         we woulda got picked up, they woulda 

                         worked in a gimmick where every 

                         episode I woulda told and ol joke.

                                     VINCENT

                         Do you remember any of the jokes?

                                     MIA

                         Well I only got the chance to say 

                         one, 'cause we only did one show.

                                     VINCENT

                         Tell me.

                                     MIA

                         No. It's really corny.

                                     VINCENT

                         C'mon, don't be that way.

                                     MIA

                         No. You won't like it and I'll be 

                         embarrassed.

                                     VINCENT

                         You told it in front of fifty million 

                         people and you can't tell it to me? 

                         I promise I won't laugh.

                                     MIA

                              (laughing)

                         That's what I'm afraid of.

                                     VINCENT

                         That's not what I meant and you know 

                         it.

                                     MIA

                         You're quite the silver tongue devil, 

                         aren't you?

                                     VINCENT

                         I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

                                     MIA

                         That's not what you said Vince. Well 

                         now I'm definitely not gonna tell 

                         ya, 'cause it's been built up too 

                         much.

                                     VINCENT

                         What a gyp.

               Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around 

               the straw of her shake.

                                     MIA

                         Yummy!

                                     VINCENT

                         Can I have a sip of that? I'd like 

                         to know what a five-dollar shake 

                         tastes like.

                                     MIA

                         Be my guest.

               She slides the shake over to him.

                                     MIA

                         You can use my straw, I don't have 

                         kooties.

               Vincent smiles.

                                     VINCENT

                         Yeah, but maybe I do.

                                     MIA

                         Kooties I can handle.

               He takes a sip.

                                     VINCENT

                         Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' 

                         good milk shake.

                                     MIA

                         Told ya.

                                     VINCENT

                         I don't know if it's worth five 

                         dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' 

                         good.

               He slides the shake back.

               Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

                                     MIA

                         Don't you hate that?

                                     VINCENT

                         What?

                                     MIA

                         Uncomfortable silences. Why do we 

                         feel it's necessary to yak about 

                         bullshit in order to be comfortable?

                                     VINCENT

                         I don't know.

                                     MIA

                         That's when you know you found 

                         somebody special. When you can just 

                         shit the fuck up for a minute, and 

                         comfortably share silence.

                                     VINCENT

                         I don't think we're there yet. But 

                         don't feel bad, we just met each 

                         other.

                                     MIA

                         Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to 

                         the bathroom and powder my nose, 

                         while you sit here and think of 

                         something to say.

                                     VINCENT

                         I'll do that.

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM)  NIGHT

               Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the 

               bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

                                     MIA

                              (imitating Steppenwolf)

                         I said goddamn!

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA)  NIGHT

               Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his 

               eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

               Mia comes back to the table.

                                     MIA

                         Don't you love it when you go to the 

                         bathroom and you come back to find 

                         your food waiting for you?

                                     VINCENT

                         We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy 

                         Holly doesn't seem to be much of a 

                         waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn 

                         Monroe's section.

                                     MIA

                         Which one, there's two Marilyn 

                         Monroes.

                                     VINCENT

                         No there's not.

               Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

                                     VINCENT

                         That's Marilyn Monroe...

               Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and 

               capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS 

                                     VINCENT

                         ... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I 

                         don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it 

                         must be her night off.

                                     MIA

                         Pretty smart.

                                     VINCENT

                         I have moments.

                                     MIA

                         Did ya think of something to say?

                                     VINCENT

                         Actually, there's something I've 

                         wanted to ask you about, but you 

                         seem like a nice person, and I didn't 

                         want to offend you.

                                     MIA

                         Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like 

                         mindless, boring, getting-to-know-

                         you chit-chat. This sounds like you 

                         actually have something to say.

                                     VINCENT

                         Only if you promise not to get 

                         offended.

                                     MIA

                         You can't promise something like 

                         that. I have no idea what you're 

                         gonna ask. You could ask me what 

                         you're gonna ask me, and my natural 

                         response could be to be offended. 

                         Then, through no fault of my own, I 

                         woulda broken my promise.

                                     VINCENT

                         Then let's just forget it.

                                     MIA

                         That is an impossibility. Trying to 

                         forget anything as intriguing as 

                         this would be an exercise in futility.

                                     VINCENT

                         Is that a fact?

               Mia nods her head: "Yes."

                                     MIA

                         Besides, it's more exciting when you 

                         don't have permission.

                                     VINCENT

                         What do you think about what happened 

                         to Antwan?

                                     MIA

                         Who's Antwan?

                                     VINCENT

                         Tony Rocky Horror.

                                     MIA

                         He fell out of a window.

                                     VINCENT

                         That's one way to say it. Another 

                         way is, he was thrown out. Another 

                         was is, he was thrown out by 

                         Marsellus. And even another way is, 

                         he was thrown out of a window by 

                         Marsellus because of you.

                                     MIA

                         Is that a fact?

                                     VINCENT

                         No it's not, it's just what I heard.

                                     MIA

                         Who told you this?

                                     VINCENT

                         They.

               Mia and Vincent smile.

                                     MIA

                         They talk a lot, don't they?

                                     VINCENT

                         They certainly do.

                                     MIA

                         Well don't by shy Vincent, what 

                         exactly did they say?

               Vincent is slow to answer.

                                     MIA

                         Let me help you Bashful, did it 

                         involve the F-word?

                                     VINCENT

                         No. They just said Rocky Horror gave 

                         you a foot massage.

                                     MIA

                         And...?

                                     VINCENT

                         No and, that's it.

                                     MIA

                         You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror 

                         out of a four-story window because 

                         he massaged my feet?

                                     VINCENT

                         Yeah.

                                     MIA

                         And you believed that?

                                     VINCENT

                         At the time I was told, it seemed 

                         reasonable.

                                     MIA

                         Marsellus throwing Tony out of a 

                         four story window for giving me a 

                         foot massage seemed reasonable?

                                     VINCENT

                         No, it seemed excessive. But that 

                         doesn't mean it didn't happen. I 

                         heard Marsellus is very protective 

                         of you.

                                     MIA

                         A husband being protective of his 

                         wife is one thing. A husband almost 

                         killing another man for touching his 

                         wife's feet is something else.

                                     VINCENT

                         But did it happen?

                                     MIA

                         The only thing Antwan ever touched 

                         of mine was my hand, when he shook 

                         it. I met Anwan once  at my wedding 

                          then never again.  The truth is, 

                         nobody knows why Marsellus tossed 

                         Tony Rocky Horror out of that window 

                         except Marsellus and Tony Rocky 

                         Horror. But when you scamps get 

                         together, you're worse than a sewing 

                         circle.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         handsome trophy that Marilyn here is

               Marilyn holds the trophy.

               Mia holds her hand.

                                     MIA

                         Right here.

               Vincent reacts.

                                     MIA

                         I wanna dance.

                                     VINCENT

                         No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

                                     MIA

                              (overlapping)

                         No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do 

                         believe Marsellus, my husband, your 

                         boss, told you to take me out and do 

                         whatever I wanted, Now, I want to 

                         dance. I want to win. I want that 

                         trophy.

                                     VINCENT

                              (sighs)

                         All right.

                                     MIA

                         So, dance good.

                                     VINCENT

                         All right, you asked for it.

               Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

                                     ED SULLIVAN

                              (into microphone)

                         Let's hear it for our first 

                         contestants.

               Patrons cheer.

               Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

                                     ED SULLIVAN

                         Now let's meet our first contestants 

                         here this evening. Young lady, what 

                         is your name?

                                     MIA

                              (into microphone)

                         Missus Mia Wallace.

                         And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

                                     MIA

                              (into microphone)

                         Vincent Vega.

                                     ED SULLIVAN

                              (into microphone)

                         All right, let's see what you can 

                         do. Take it away!

               Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL". 

               They make hand movements as they dance.

               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME  NIGHT

               The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-

               style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the 

               previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

               Then...

               The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

                                     VINCENT

                         Was than an uncomfortable silence?

                                     MIA

                         I don't know what that was.

                              (pause)

                         Music and drinks!

               Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his 

               overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

                                     VINCENT

                         I'm gonna take a piss.

                                     MIA

                         That was a little bit more information 

                         than I needed to know, but go right 

                         ahead.

               Vincent shuffles off to the john.

               Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs 

               and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high 

               energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She 

               dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's 

               overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It 

               feels good.

               Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. 

               Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco 

               on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks 

               the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a 

               little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so 

               anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out 

               his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, 

               trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you 

               know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly 

               brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, 

               then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

               The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she 

               takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in 

               the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something 

               else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder 

               inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. 

               Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her 

               face.

                                     MIA

                              (like you would say 

                              Bingo!)

                         Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, 

                         you've been holding out on me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE)  NIGHT

               Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to 

               himself in the mirror.

                                     VINCENT

                         One drink and leave. Don't be rude, 

                         but drink your drink quickly, say 

                         goodbye, walk out the door, get in 

                         your car, and go down the road.

               LIVING ROOM

               Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines 

               on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred 

               dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the 

               fat line.

               CLOSEUP  MIA

               Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels 

               like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. 

               Then... the rush hits...

               BATHROOM

               Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his 

               dialogue with the mirror.

                                     VINCENT

                         ...It's a moral test of yourself, 

                         whether or not you can maintain 

                         loyalty. Because when people are 

                         loyal to each other, that's very 

                         meaningful.

               LIVING ROOM

               Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but 

               it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from 

               her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her 

               stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

               BATHROOM

               Vince continues.

                                     VINCENT

                         So you're gonna go out there, drink 

                         your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had 

                         a very lovely evening," go home, and 

                         jack off.  And that's all you're 

                         gonna do.

               Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's 

               ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of 

               that door. So he goes through it.

               LIVING ROOM

               We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to 

               the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like 

               a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are 

               down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the 

               tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her 

               face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. 

               Slack-jawed.

                                     VINCENT

                         Jesus Christ!

               Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body. 

               Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck 

               to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

               Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

                                     VINCENT

                              (sounding weird)

                         Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

               But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, 

               but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

               Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

                                     VINCENT

                              (to himself)

                         I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.

                              (to Mia)

                         Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer 

                         me honey, what did you take?

               Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

               Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the 

               rack.

               He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent 

               makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

                                     VINCENT

                              (yelling to Mia)

                         Okay honey, we're getting you on 

                         your feet.

               He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

                                     VINCENT

                         We're on our feet now, and now we're 

                         gonna talk out to the car. Here we 

                         go, watch us walk.

               We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-

               unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

               EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING)  NIGHT

               INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

               Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws, 

               speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

               INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING)  NIGHT

               Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting 

               like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when 

               he glances over at Mia.

               Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag 

               of water.

               Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches 

               a number.

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant 

               drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

               He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-

               out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT, 

               CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand 

               is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of 

               him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n 

               Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in 

               an ashtray.

               On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three 

               Stooges, and they're getting married.

                         Hold hands, you love birds.

               The phone RINGS.

               Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

               It RINGS again.

               Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

                                     JODY (O.S.)

               VINCENT IN THE MALIBU

               Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching 

               the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the 

               conversation.

                                     VINCENT

                                     VINCENT

                         Sorry.

                         Too late, I'm already here.

               At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu 

               coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his 

               curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH 

               in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn 

               and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out 

               of SHATTERS from the impact.

                                     JODY (O.S.)

                         What the hell was that?

               Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front 

               lawn.

               EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia 

               out.

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

               Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's 

               wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone 

               on it.

               We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking 

               through the hall into the living room.

                                     JODY

                         It's only one-thirty in the goddamn 

                         mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on 

                         out here?

               As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance 

               standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of 

               the room.

               From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a 

               DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference 

               here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

                                     JODY

                         Who's she?

               Lance looks up at Jody.

                              (in stereo)

               She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking 

               for the shot.

               WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

               WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

               INT. SPARE ROOM

               With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning 

               the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words, 

               "Come on," endlessly.

               From OFF SCREEN we hear:

               Lance continues his frenzied search.

               WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

                                     JODY (O.S.)

                         What's he lookin' for?

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)

                         I dunno, some medical book.

               Jody calls to LANCE.

                                     JODY (O.S.)

                         What are you lookin' for?

                                     LANCE

                         My black medical book!

               As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit, 

               Jody appears in the doorway.

                                     JODY

                         Whata're you looking for?

                                     LANCE

                         My black fuckin' medical book. It's 

                         like a text book they give to nurses.

                                     JODY

                         I never saw a medical book.

                                     LANCE

                         Trust me, I have one.

                                     JODY

                         Well if it's that important, why 

                         didn't you keep it with the shot?

               Lance spins toward her.

                                     LANCE

                         I don't know! Stop bothering me!

                                     JODY

                         While you're lookin' for it, that 

                         girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're 

                         never gonna find it in all this shit.  

                         For six months now, I've been telling 

                         you to clean this room 

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)

                          get your ass in here, fuck the 

                         book!

               Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT 

               heading for the living room.

               LIVING ROOM

               Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance 

               reenters the room.

                                     VINCENT

                         Quit fuckin' around man and give her 

                         the shot!

               Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He 

               opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

                                     LANCE

                         While I'm doing this, take her shirt 

                         off and find her heart.

               Vince rips her blouse open.

               Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

                                     VINCENT

                         Does it have to be exact?

                                     LANCE

                         Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving 

                         her an injection in the heart, so I 

                         gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

                                     VINCENT

                         Well, I don't know exactly where her 

                         heart is, I think it's here.

               Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and 

               nods.

                                     LANCE

                         That's it.

               As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

                                     VINCENT

                         I need a big fat magic marker, got 

                         one?

                                     JODY

                         What?

                                     VINCENT

                         I need a big fat magic marker, any 

                         felt pen'll do, but a magic marker 

                         would be great.

                                     JODY

                         Hold on.

               Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her 

               enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents 

               of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

               The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

                                     LANCE

                         It's ready, I'll tell you what to 

                         do.

                                     VINCENT

                         You're gonna give her the shot.

                                     LANCE

                         No, you're gonna give her the shot.

                                     VINCENT

                         I've never does this before.

                                     LANCE

                         I've never done this before either, 

                         and I ain't starting now. You brought 

                         'er here, that means you give her 

                         the shot. The day I bring an ODing 

                         bitch to your place, then I gotta 

                         give her the shot.

               Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic 

               marker in her hand.

                                     JODY

                         Got it.

               Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes 

               a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

                                     VINCENT

                         Okay, what do I do?

                                     LANCE

                         Well, you're giving her an injection 

                         of adrenaline straight to her heart. 

                         But she's got a breast plate in front 

                         of her heart, so you gotta pierce 

                         through that. So what you gotta do 

                         is bring the needle down in a stabbing 

                         motion.

               Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The 

               Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".

                                     VINCENT

                         I gotta stab her?

                                     LANCE

                         If you want the needle to pierce 

                         through to her heart, you gotta stab 

                         her hard.

               Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

                                     VINCENT

                         What happens after that?

                                     LANCE

                         I'm curious about that myself.

                                     VINCENT

                         This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

                                     LANCE

                         She's supposed to come out of it 

                         like 

                              (snaps his fingers)

                          that.

               Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing 

               motion.

               He looks down on Mia.

               Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

               Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

                                     VINCENT

                         Count to three.

               Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know 

               what to expect.

                                     LANCE

                         One...

               RED DOT on Mia's body.

               Needle raised ready to strike.

                                     LANCE (O.S.)

                         ...two...

               Jody's face is alive with anticipation.

               NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.

                                     LANCE (O.S.)

                         ...three!

               The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

               Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the 

               chest.

               Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

               The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline 

               out through the needle.

               Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of 

               the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck 

               in her chest  SCREAMING.

               Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in 

               front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

               Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of 

               air.

               The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken 

               to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

                                     LANCE

                         If you're okay, say something.

               Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a 

               relatively normal voice.

                                     MIA

                         Something.

               Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and 

               shaking from how close to death Mia came.

                                     JODY

                         Anybody want a beer?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING)  NIGHT

               Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says 

               anything, both are still too shaken.

               EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying 

               a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway 

               toward her front door.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)

                         Mia!

               She turns around.

               Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big 

               distance between the two.

                                     VINCENT

                         What are your thoughts on how to 

                         handle this?

                                     MIA

                         What's yours?

                                     VINCENT

                         Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus 

                         can live his whole live and never 

                         ever hear of this incident.

               Mia smiles.

                                     MIA

                         Don't worry about it. If Marsellus 

                         ever heard of this, I'd be in as 

                         much trouble as you.

                                     VINCENT

                         I seriously doubt that.

                                     MIA

                         If you can keep a secret, so can I.

                                     VINCENT

                         Let's shake on it.

               The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to 

               shake and shake they do.

                                     VINCENT

                         Mum's the word.

               Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-

               evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

               Vincent smiles.

                                     VINCENT

                         If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home 

                         and have a heart attack.

               Mia giggles.

               Vincent turns to leave.

                                     MIA

                         You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE 

                         FIVE" joke?

               Vincent turns around.

                                     VINCENT

                         Sure, but I think I'm still a little 

                         too petrified to laugh.

                                     MIA

                         Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's 

                         not funny. But if you still wanna 

                         hear it, I'll tell it.

                                     VINCENT

                         I can't wait.

                                     MIA

                         Three tomatoes are walking down the 

                         street, a poppa tomato, a momma 

                         tomato, and a little baby tomato. 

                         The baby tomato is lagging behind 

                         the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa 

                         tomato gets mad, goes over to the 

                         momma tomato and stamps on him 

                              (stamps on the ground)

               BUTCH'S POV

               We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in 

               Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish, 

               stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to 

               her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force 

               officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old 

               boy.

                                     MOTHER

                         Butch, stop watching TV a second. We 

                         got a special visitor. Now do you 

                         remember when I told you your daddy 

                         dies in a P.O.W. camp?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)

                         Uh-huh.

                                     MOTHER

                         Well this here is Capt. Koons. He 

                         was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

               CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and 

               bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's 

               eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas 

               accent.

                                     CAPT. KOONS

                         Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard 

                         a bunch about you. See, I was a good 

                         friend of your Daddy's. We were in 

                         that Hanoi pit of hell over five 

                         years together.  Hopefully, you'll 

                         never have to experience this 

                         yourself, but when two men are in a 

                         situation like me and your Daddy 

                         were, for as long as we were, you 

                         take on certain responsibilities of 

                         the other. If it had been me who had 

                         not made it, Major Coolidge would be 

                         talkin' right now to my son Jim. But 

                         the way it worked out is I'm talkin' 

                         to you, Butch. I got somethin' for 

                         ya.

               The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

                                     CAPT. KOONS

                         This watch I got here was first 

                         purchased by your great-granddaddy. 

                         It was bought during the First World 

                         War in a little general store in 

                         Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought 

                         by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge 

                         the day he set sail for Paris. It 

                         was your great-granddaddy's war watch, 

                         made by the first company to ever 

                         make wrist watches. You see, up until 

                         then, people just carried pocket 

                         watches. Your great-granddaddy wore 

                         that watch every day he was in the 

                         war. Then when he had done his duty, 

                         he went home to your great-

                         grandmother, took the watch off his 

                         wrist and put it in an ol' coffee 

                         can. And in that can it stayed 'til 

                         your grandfather Dane Coolidge was 

                         called upon by his country to go 

                         overseas and fight the Germans once 

                         again. This time they called it World 

                         War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave 

                         it to your granddad for good luck.  

                         Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as 

                         good as his old man's. Your granddad 

                         was a Marine and he was killed with 

                         all the other Marines at the battle 

                         of Wake Island. Your granddad was 

                         facing death and he knew it. None of 

                         those boys had any illusions about 

                         ever leavin' that island alive. So 

                         three days before the Japanese took 

                         the island, your 22-year old 

                         grandfather asked a gunner on an Air 

                         Force transport named Winocki, a man 

                         he had never met before in his life, 

                         to deliver to his infant son, who he 

                         had never seen in the flesh, his 

                         gold watch. Three days later, your 

                         grandfather was dead. But Winocki 

                         kept his word. After the war was 

                         over, he paid a visit to your 

                         grandmother, delivering to your infant 

                         father, his Dad's gold watch. This 

                         watch. This watch was on your Daddy's 

                         wrist when he was shot down over 

                         Hanoi. He was captured and put in a 

                         Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew 

                         if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd 

                         be confiscated. The way your Daddy 

                         looked at it, that watch was your 

                         birthright. And he'd be damned if 

                         and slopeheads were gonna put their 

                         greasy yella hands on his boy's 

                         birthright. So he hid it in the one 

                         place he knew he could hide somethin'. 

                         His ass. Five long years, he wore 

                         this watch up his ass. Then when he 

                         died of dysentery, he gave me the 

                         watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk 

                         of metal up my ass for two years. 

                         Then, after seven years, I was sent 

                         home to my family. And now, little 

                         man, I give the watch to you.

               Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes 

               into FRAME to accept it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKER ROOM  NIGHT

               The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: 

               trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few 

               zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to 

               him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, 

               he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

               His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a 

               little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to 

               be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

                                     KLONDIKE

                         It's time, Butch.

                                     BUTCH

                         I'm ready.

               Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB 

               outside.

               He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch 

               hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him 

               on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH 

               COOLIDGE".

               The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for 

               Butch.

               As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. 

               Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, 

               empty locker room.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The 

               sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked 

               car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from 

               inside.

                         ...Coolidge was out of there faster 

                         than I've ever seen a victorious 

                         boxer vacate the ring. Do you think 

                         he knew Willis was dead?

                                     SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)

                         My guess would be yes, Richard. I 

                         could see from my position here, the 

                         frenzy in his eyes give way to the 

                         realization of what he was doing. I 

                         think any man would've left the ring 

                         that fast.

               Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named 

               ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks, 

               sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a 

               white styrofoam cup.

                         Do you feel this ring death tragedy 

                         will have an effect on the world of

                         Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't 

                         help but shake the world of boxing 

                         to its very foundation. But it's of 

                         paramount importance that during the 

                         sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the 

                         W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the

               She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in 

               the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

               EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING)  NIGHT

               A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-

               side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage 

               dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed 

               in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to 

               the dumpster below.

               ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

               Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS 

               to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and 

               throws it to the ground.

               INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING)  NIGHT

               Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, 

               HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

               Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through 

               the rearview mirror:

                                     ESMARELDA

                              (Spanish accent)

                         Are you the man I was supposed to 

                         pick up?

                                     BUTCH

                         If you're the cab I called, I'm the 

                         guy you're supposed to pick up.

                                     ESMARELDA

                         Where to?

                                     BUTCH

                         Outta here.

               The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

               The meter is FLIPPED on.

               Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

               EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING)  NIGHT

               The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet 

               pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

               INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM)  NIGHT

               Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through 

               the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall, 

               shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave 

               takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by 

               the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

               on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

               The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, 

               hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support. 

               We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

               Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

               Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)

                         What'cha got?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE

                         He booked.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)

                         I'm prepared to scour the earth for 

                         this motherfucker. If Butch goes to 

                         Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' 

                         in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a 

                         cap in his ass.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE

                         I'll take care of it.

               INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING)  NIGHT

               Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

               Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

               He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't 

               find the roll bar.

                                     BUTCH

                         Hey, how do I open the window back 

                         here?

                                     ESMARELDA

                         I have to do it.

               She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch 

               tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying 

               the other one.

               Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

                                     ESMARELDA

                         Hey, mister?

                                     BUTCH

                              (still working on the 

                              glove)

                         What?

                                     ESMARELDA

                         You were in that fight? The fight on 

                         the radio  you're the fighter?

               As he tosses his other glove out the window.

                                     BUTCH

                         Whatever gave you that idea?

                                     ESMARELDA

                         No c'mon, you're him, I know you're 

                         him, tell me you're him.

                                     BUTCH

                              (drying himself with 

                              a gym towel)

                         I'm him.

                                     ESMARELDA

                         You killed the other boxing man.

                                     BUTCH

                         He's dead?

                                     ESMARELDA

                         The radio said he was dead.

               He finished wiping himself down.

                                     BUTCH

                              (to himself)

                         Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

               He tosses the towel out the window.

               Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

                                     ESMARELDA

                         What does it feel like?

                                     BUTCH

                              (finds his shirt)

                         What does what feel like?

                                     ESMARELDA

                         Killing a man. Beating another man 

                         to death with your bare hands.

               Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

                                     BUTCH

                         Are you some kinda weirdo?

                                     ESMARELDA

                         No, it's a subject I have much 

                         interest in. You are the first person 

                         I ever met who has killed somebody. 

                         So, what was it like to kill a man?

                                     BUTCH

                         Tell ya what, you give me one of 

                         them cigarettes, I'll give you an 

                         answer.

               Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

                                     ESMARELDA

                         Deal!

               Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road, 

               passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not 

               looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in 

               it.

               Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

               He takes a long drag.

                                     BUTCH

                         So...

               He looks at her license.

                                     BUTCH

                         ...Esmarelda Villalobos  is that 

                         Mexican?

                                     ESMARELDA

                         The name is Spanish, but I'm 

                         Columbian.

                                     BUTCH

                         It's a very pretty name.

                                     ESMARELDA

                         It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

                                     BUTCH

                         That's one hell of a name you got 

                         there, sister.

                                     ESMARELDA

                         Thank you. And what is your name?

                                     BUTCH

                         Butch.

                                     ESMARELDA

                         Butch. What does it mean?

                                     BUTCH

                         I'm an American, our names don't 

                         mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, 

                         what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

                                     ESMARELDA

                         I want to know what it feels like to 

                         kill a man 

                                     BUTCH

                          I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know 

                         he was dead 'til you told me he was 

                         dead. Now I know he's dead, do you 

                         wanna know how I feel about it?

               Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

                                     BUTCH

                         I don't feel the least little bit 

                         bad.

               EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING)  NIGHT

               We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

                                     BUTCH

                              (into phone)

                         What'd I tell ya, soon as the word 

                         got out a fix was in, the odds would 

                         be outta control. Hey, if he was a 

                         better fighter he's be alive. If he 

                         never laced up his gloves in the 

                         first place, which he never shoulda 

                         done, he'd be alive. Enough about 

                         the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's 

                         talk about the rich and prosperous 

                         Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you 

                         spread it around with?

                                     (PAUSE)

                         Eight? How long to collect?

                              (pause)

                         So by tomorrow evening, you'll have 

                         it all?

                              (pause)

                         Good news Scotty, real good news  I 

                         understand a few stragglers aside. 

                         Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in 

                         the morning. It should take us a 

                         couple days to get into Knoxville. 

                         Next time we see each other, it'll 

                         be on Tennessee time.

               Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to 

               take him wherever he wants to go.

                                     BUTCH

                              (to himself in French 

                              with English subtitles)

                         Fabienne my love, our adventure 

                         begins.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING)  NIGHT

               Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain 

               has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out, 

               now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic 

               jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

                                     ESMARELDA

                         Forty-five sixty.

               Handing her the money.

                                     BUTCH

                         Merci beaucoup. And here's a little 

                         something for the effort.

               Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

               Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds 

               it out of reach.

                                     BUTCH

                         Now if anybody should ask you about 

                         who your fare was tonight, what're 

                         you gonna tell 'em?

                                     ESMARELDA

                         The truth. Three well-dressed, 

                         slightly toasted, Mexicans.

               He gives her the bill.

                                     BUTCH

                         Bon soir, Esmarelda.

                                     ESMARELDA

                              (in Spanish)

                         Sleep well, Butch.

               He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away. 

               She drives off.

               INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX)  NIGHT

               Butch enters and turns on the light.

               Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to 

               us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Keep the light off.

               Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

                                     BUTCH

                         Is that better, sugar pop?

                                     FABIENNE

                         Oui. Hard day at the office?

                                     BUTCH

                         Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

               Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

               When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in 

               babytalk.

                                     FABIENNE

                         I was looking at myself in the mirror.

                                     BUTCH

                         Uh-huh?

                                     FABIENNE

                         I wish I had a pot.

                                     BUTCH

                         You were lookin' in the mirror and 

                         you wish you had some pot?

                                     FABIENNE

                         A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are 

                         sexy.

                                     BUTCH

                         Well you should be happy, 'cause you 

                         do.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! 

                         I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna 

                         when she did "Lucky Star," it's not 

                         the same thing.

                                     BUTCH

                         I didn't realize there was a 

                         difference between a tummy and a pot 

                         belly.

                                     FABIENNE

                         The difference is huge.

                                     BUTCH

                         You want me to have a pot?

                                     FABIENNE

                         No. Pot bellies make a man look either 

                         oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a 

                         woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The 

                         rest of you is normal. Normal face, 

                         normal legs, normal hips, normal 

                         ass, but with a big, perfectly round 

                         pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a 

                         tee-shirt two sizes too small to 

                         accentuate it.

                                     BUTCH

                         You think guys would find that 

                         attractive?

                                     FABIENNE

                         I don't give a damn what men find 

                         attractive. It's unfortunate what we 

                         find pleasing to the touch and 

                         pleasing to the eye is seldom the 

                         same.

                                     BUTCH

                         If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in 

                         it.

                                     FABIENNE

                         You'd punch me in my belly?

                                     BUTCH

                         Right in the belly.

                                     FABIENNE

                         I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your 

                         right on your face 'til you couldn't 

                         breathe.

                                     BUTCH

                         You'd do that to me?

                                     FABIENNE

                         Yes!

                                     BUTCH

                         Did you get everything, sugar pop?

                                     FABIENNE

                         Yes, I did.

                                     BUTCH

                         Good job.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Did everything go as planned?

                                     BUTCH

                         You didn't listen to the radio?

                                     FABIENNE

                         I never listen to your fights. Were 

                         you the winner?

                                     BUTCH

                         I won alright.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Are you still retiring?

                                     BUTCH

                         Sure am.

                                     FABIENNE

                         What about the man you fought?

                                     BUTCH

                         Floyd retired too.

                                     FABIENNE

                              (smiling)

                         Really?! He won't be fighting no 

                         more?!

                                     BUTCH

                         Not no more.

                                     FABIENNE

                         So it all worked out in the finish?

                                     BUTCH

                         We ain't at the finish, baby.

               Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

                                     FABIENNE

                         We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE

                         If they find us, they'll kill us, 

                         won't they?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE

                         But they won't find us, will they?

               Butch nods his head: "no."

                                     FABIENNE

                         Do you still want me to go with you?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE

                         I don't want to be a burden or a 

                         nuisance -

               Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her 

               crotch.

               Fabienne reacts.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Say it!

                                     BUTCH

                         Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Forever?

                                     BUTCH

                         ...and ever.

               Fabienne lies her head back.

               Butch continues to massage her crotch.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Do you love me?

                                     BUTCH

                         Oui.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

               Butch kisses her on the mouth.

                                     BUTCH

                         Will you kiss it?

               She nods her head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE

                         But you first.

               Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral 

               pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

                                     FABIENNE

                              (in French, with 

                              English subtitles)

                         Butch my love, the adventure begins.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               MOTEL ROOM

               Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in 

               the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We 

               see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow 

               her up.

               She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower 

               washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the 

               smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. 

               Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his 

               head out.

                                     BUTCH

                         I think I cracked a rib.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Giving me oral pleasure?

                                     BUTCH

                         No retard, from the fight.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Don't call me retard.

                                     BUTCH

                              (in a Mongoloid voice)

                         My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

                                     FABIENNE

                         Shut up fuck head! I hate that 

                         Mongoloid voice.

                                     BUTCH

                         Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it 

                         back!  Can I have a towel please, 

                         Miss Beautiful Tulip.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Oh I like that, I like being called 

                         a tulip. Tulip is much better than 

                         Mongoloid.

               She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban 

               on her head.

                                     BUTCH

                         I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I 

                         called you a retard, but I took it 

                         back.

               She hands him a towel.

                                     BUTCH

                         Merci beaucoup.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Butch?

                                     BUTCH

                              (drying his head)

                         Yes, lemon pie.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Where are we going to go?

                                     BUTCH

                         I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. 

                         We're gonna get a lot of money from 

                         this. But it ain't gonna be so much, 

                         we can live like hogs in the fat 

                         house forever. I was thinking we 

                         could go somewhere in the South 

                         Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll 

                         carry us a long way down there.

                                     FABIENNE

                         So if we wanted, we could live in 

                         Bora Bora?

                                     BUTCH

                         You betcha. And if after awhile you 

                         don't dig Bora Bora, then we can 

                         move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

                                     FABIENNE

                         But I do not speak Spanish.

                                     BUTCH

                         You don't speak Bora Boran either.

                         Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta 

                         el zapataria?

                                     FABIENNE

                         What does that mean?

                                     BUTCH

                         Where's the shoe store?

                                     FABIENNE

                         Donde esta el zapataria?

                                     BUTCH

                         Excellent pronunciation. You'll be 

                         my little mama ceta in no time.

               Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes 

               her teeth.

               Butch keeps on from the other room.

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)

                         Que hora es?

                                     FABIENNE

                         Que hora es?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)

                         What time is it?

                                     FABIENNE

                         What time is it?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)

                         Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or 

               two, then she remember something.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Butch.

               She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only 

               to find him sound asleep in bed.

               She looks at him for a moment.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Forget it.

               She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the 

               WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               MOTEL ROOM  MORNING

               SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still 

               asleep in bed.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the 

               bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still 

               wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

               ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking 

               on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

               Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing 

               him.

               His start startles Fabienne.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Merde! You startled me. Did you have 

                         a bad dream?

               Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to 

               focus.

               Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV 

               Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

                                     BUTCH

                         What are you watching?

                                     FABIENNE

                         A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the 

                         name.

                                     BUTCH

                         Are you watchin' it?

               Fabienne enters the room.

                                     FABIENNE

                         In a way. Why? Would you like for me 

                         to switch it off?

                                     BUTCH

                         Would you please?

               She reaches over and turns off the TV.

                                     BUTCH

                         It's a little too early in the morning 

                         for explosions and war.

                                     FABIENNE

                         What was it about?

                                     BUTCH

                         How should I know, you were the one 

                         watchin' it.

               Fabienne laughs.

                                     FABIENNE

                         No, imbecile, what was your dream 

                         about?

                                     BUTCH

                         Oh, I... don't remember. It's really 

                         rare I remember a dream.

                                     FABIENNE

                         You just woke up from it.

                                     BUTCH

                         Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I 

                         don't remember.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Well, let's look at the grumpy man 

                         in the morning. I didn't say you 

                         were lying, it's just odd you don't 

                         remember your dreams. I always 

                         remember mine. Did you know you talk 

                         in your sleep?

                                     BUTCH

                         I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk 

                         in my sleep?

                                     FABIENNE

                         You did last night.

                                     BUTCH

                         What did I say?

               Laying on top of him.

                                     FABIENNE

                         I don't know. I couldn't understand 

                         you.

               She kisses Butch.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Why don't you get up and we'll get 

                         some breakfast at that breakfast 

                         place with the pancakes.

                                     BUTCH

                         One more kiss and I'll get up.

               Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Satisfied?

                                     BUTCH

                         Yep.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Then get up, lazy bones.

               Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of 

               the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

                                     BUTCH

                         What time is it?

                                     FABIENNE

                         Almost nine in the morning. What 

                         time does our train arrive?

                                     BUTCH

                         Eleven.

                                     FABIENNE

                         I'm gonna order a big plate of 

                         blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, 

                         eggs over easy, and five sausages.

                                     BUTCH

                              (surprised at her 

                              potential appetite)

                         Anything to drink with that?

               Butch is finished dressing.

                                     FABIENNE

                              (referring to his 

                              clothes)

                         Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a 

                         tall glass or orange juice and a 

                         black cup of coffee. After that, I'm 

                         going to have a slice of pie.

               As he goes through the suitcase.

                                     BUTCH

                         Pie for breakfast?

                                     FABIENNE

                         Any time of the day is a good time 

                         for pie. Blueberry pie to go with 

                         the pancakes. And on top, a thin 

                         slice of melted cheese 

                                     BUTCH

                          where's my watch?

                                     FABIENNE

                         It's there.

                                     BUTCH

                         No, it's not. It's not here.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Have you looked?

               By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

                                     BUTCH

                         Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

               He's now throwing clothes.

                                     BUTCH

                         What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! 

                         Are you sure you got it?

               Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer 

                                     BUTCH

                          on the little kangaroo.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

                                     BUTCH

                         Well it's not here!

                                     FABIENNE

                              (on the verge of tears)

                         Well it should be!

                                     BUTCH

                         Oh it most definitely should be here, 

                         but it's not. So where is it?

               Fabienne is crying and scared.

               Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more 

               menacing.

                                     BUTCH

                         Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' 

                         watch. You know what my father went 

                         through to git me that watch?... I 

                         don't wanna get into it right now... 

                         but he went through a lot. Now all 

                         this other shit, you coulda set on 

                         fire, but I specifically reminded 

                         you not to forget my father's watch. 

                         Now think, did you get it?

                                     FABIENNE

                         I believe so...

                                     BUTCH

                         You believe so? You either did, or 

                         you didn't, now which one is it?

                                     FABIENNE

                         Then I did.

                                     BUTCH

                         Are you sure?

                                     FABIENNE

                              (shaking)

                         No.

               Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

               Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the 

               motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

               Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

               Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

                                     BUTCH

                              (to Fabienne)

                         No! It's not your fault.

                              (he approached her)

                         You left it at the apartment.

               He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

               He touches her hand, she flinches.

                                     BUTCH

                         If you did leave it at the apartment, 

                         it's not your fault. I had you bring 

                         a bunch of stuff. I reminded you 

                         about it, but I didn't illustrate 

                         how personal the watch was to me. If 

                         all I gave a fuck about was my watch, 

                         I should've told you. You ain't a 

                         mind reader.

               He kisses her hand. Then rises.

               Fabienne is still sniffling.

               Butch goes to the closet.

                                     FABIENNE

                         I'm sorry.

               Butch puts on his high school jacket.

                                     BUTCH

                         Don't be. It just means I won't be 

                         able to eat breakfast with you.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Why does it mean that?

                                     BUTCH

                         Because I'm going back to my apartment 

                         to get my watch.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Won't the gangsters be looking for 

                         you there?

                                     BUTCH

                         That's what I'm gonna find out. If 

                         they are, and I don't think I can 

                         handle it, I'll split.

               Rising from the floor.

                                     FABIENNE

                         I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, 

                         I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

               Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

                                     BUTCH

                         Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing 

                         you could ever do would make me 

                         permanently angry at you.

                              (pause)

                         I love you, remember?

                              (he digs some money 

                              out of his wallet)

                         Now here's some money, order those 

                         pancakes and have a great breakfast.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Don't go.

                                     BUTCH

                         I'll be back before you can say, 

                         blueberry pie.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Blueberry pie.

                                     BUTCH

                         Well maybe not that fast, but fast. 

                         Okay?  Okay?

                                     FABIENNE

                         Okay.

               He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

                                     BUTCH

                         Bye-bye, sugar pop.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Bye.

                                     BUTCH

                         I'm gonna take your Honda.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Okay.

               And with that, he's out the door.

               Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

               INT. HONDA (MOVING)  DAY

               Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his 

               fists as he drives down the street.

                                     BUTCH

                         Of all the fuckin' things she coulda 

                         forgot, she forgets my father's watch. 

                         I specifically reminded her not to 

                         forget it. "Bedside table  on the 

                         kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't 

                         forget my father's watch."

               EXT. CITY STREET  DAY

               The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is 

               little engine will take it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the 

               arrow pointing at one hour.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER  DAY

               Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a 

               couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before 

               he goes boppin' through the front door.

               EXT. ALLEY  DAY

               Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, 

               then he discreetly glances out.

               EXT. STREET  BUTCH'S APARTMENT  DAY

               Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of 

               cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of 

               place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.  

               Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of 

               Butch's home.

               Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

               Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He 

               crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

               Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a 

               combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign 

               sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a 

               graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

               EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY

               Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment 

               building. Once again, everything appears normal  the laundry 

               room, the pool, his apartment door  nothing appears 

               disturbed.

               Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. 

               He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

               Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening 

               it.

               INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT  DAY

               His apartment hasn't been touched.

               He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick 

               look around. Obviously, no one is there.

               Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the 

               refrigerator.

               He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

               With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he 

               goes to the bedroom.

               His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment  neat, clean 

               and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a 

               few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue 

               of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of 

               Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

               Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On 

               the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

               He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He 

               opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting 

               down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and 

               puts them in the toaster.

               Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

               What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun 

               with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

                                     BUTCH

                              (softly)

                         Holy shit.

               He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines 

               it.

               Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

               Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to 

               the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

               Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not 

               knowing what to do.

               The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the 

               bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book 

               "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

               Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

               Vincent freezes.

               Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's 

               direction.

               Neither man opens his mouth.

               Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

               That's all the situation needed.

               Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

               MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

               Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets 

               SIMULTANEOUSLY  LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him 

               through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door 

               at the end of the bathroom.

               By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent 

               is annihilated.

               Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look 

               goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once 

               Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

               With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 

               back on the kitchen counter.

               Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

               EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY

               Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the 

               courtyard...

               ...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

               ...goes through the alley...

               ...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

               EXT. HONDA  DAY

               Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide 

               smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET  DAY

               The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his 

               apartment building.

               INT. HONDA  DAY

               Butch looks out the window at his former home.

                                     BUTCH

                         That's how you're gonna beat 'em, 

                         Butch.  They keep underestimatin' 

                         ya.

               This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips 

               a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he 

               SINGS along with it.

               He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on 

               the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

               Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we 

               see:

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

               The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, 

               carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam 

               cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street 

               in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see 

               Marsellus clearly.

               Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front 

               of him.

               When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances 

               to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

               DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

               Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. 

               He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

               The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts 

               and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

               Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold 

               Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending 

               it up on the sidewalk.

               Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what 

               at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his 

               nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. 

               A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

                                     PEDESTRIAN

                         Jesus, are you okay?

               Butch look at him, spaced-out.

                                     BUTCH

                         I guess.

               Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS 

               gather around the body.

                                     GAWKER #1

                              (to the others)

                         He's dead! He's dead!

               This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

               TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

               The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

                                     GAWKER #2

                         If you need a witness in court, I'll 

                         be glad to help. He was a drunken 

                         maniac. He hit you and crashed into 

                         that car.

                                     MARSELLUS

                              (still incoherent)

                         Who?

                                     GAWKER #2

                              (pointing at Butch)

                         Him.

               Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge 

               down the street, looking a shambles.

                                     MARSELLUS

                         Well, I'll be damned.

               The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back 

               away.

               Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

               Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward 

               him.

                                     BUTCH

                         Sacre bleu.

               Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, 

               shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

               He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, 

               screaming.

                                     LOOKY-LOO WOMAN

                         Oh my God, I've been shot!

               That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

               Marsellus RUNS after him.

               The CROWD looks agape.

               Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

               The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

               Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a 

               sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

               INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP  DAY

               MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter 

               of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of 

               Butch RACES into his world.

                                     MAYNARD

                         Can I help you wit' somethin'?

                                     BUTCH

                         Shut up!

               Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands 

               next to the door.

                                     MAYNARD

                         Now you just wait one goddamn minute 

               Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. 

               He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist 

               in Marsellus' face.

               The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man 

               FALLS FLAT on his back.

               Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

               Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in 

               the face.

               Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold 

               of his middle finger.

                                     BUTCH

                         So you like chasing people, huh?

               He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch 

               then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS 

               back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to 

               shield the splatter.

                                     BUTCH

                         Well guess what, big man, you caught 

                         me 

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)

                          hold it right there, godammit!

               Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a 

               pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

                                     BUTCH

                         Look mister, this ain't any of your 

                         business 

                                     MAYNARD

                          I'm makin' it my business! Now 

                         toss that gun!

               Butch does.

                                     MAYNARD

                         Now you on top, stand up and come to 

                         the counter.

               Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he 

               gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face 

               with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

               After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on 

               the counter and moves to the telephone.

               Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily 

               watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on 

               the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

                                     MAYNARD

                         Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just 

                         caught a coupl'a flies.

               Marsellus passes out.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM  DAY

               TWO SHOT  BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

               They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are 

               two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and 

               a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are 

               unconscious.

               Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both 

               guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two 

               prisoners look up at their captors.

               Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one 

               hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in 

               his belt.

                                     MAYNARD

                         Nobody kills anybody in my place of 

                         business except me or Zed.

               A BUZZER buzzes.

                                     MAYNARD

                         That's Zed.

               Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs 

               that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

               WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed 

               inside the store.

               Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of 

               the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking 

               in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, 

               all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both 

               share at what they've gotten themselves into.

               Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even 

               more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. 

               The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is 

               a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and 

               stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a 

               long time, then says:

                                     ZED

                              (to Maynard)

                         You said you waited for me?

                                     MAYNARD

                         I did.

                                     ZED

                         Then how come they're all beat up?

                                     MAYNARD

                         They did that to each other. They 

                         was fightin' when they came in. This 

                         one was gonna shoot that one.

                                     ZED

                              (to Butch)

                         You were gonna shoot him?

               Butch makes no reply.

                                     ZED

                         Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front 

                         of this place?

                                     MAYNARD

                         Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

                                     ZED

                         No, it's Thursday.

                                     MAYNARD

                         Then she'll be fine.

                                     ZED

                         Bring out The Gimp.

                                     MAYNARD

                         I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

                                     ZED

                         Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em 

                         up then, won't you?

               Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

                                     MAYNARD

                              (yelling in the hole)

                         Wake up!

               Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a 

               leash.

               He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises 

               THE GIMP.

               The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black 

               leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs 

               here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather 

               mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. 

               They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large 

               dog.

               Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, 

               then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, 

               then backs away.

                                     MAYNARD

                              (to The Gimp)

                         Down!

               The Gimp gets on its knees.

               Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

                                     MAYNARD

                         Who's first?

                                     ZED

                         I ain't fer sure yet.

               Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, 

               miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his 

               finger going back and forth between the two.

               Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

               Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

               The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

               Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving 

               left to right, then it stops.

               TWO SHOT  BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

               After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on 

               Marsellus.

               Zed stands up.

                                     ZED

                         Wanna do it here?

                                     MAYNARD

                         Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old 

                         room.

               Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old 

               room.

               Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the 

               misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. 

               Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and 

               Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the 

               back room, is empty.

               As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before 

               he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

                                     MAYNARD

                              (to The Gimp)

                         Up!

               The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on 

               the ceiling.

                                     MAYNARD

                         Keep an eye on this one.

               The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into 

               Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because 

               suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

               Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath 

               the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history 

               of comedy.

               From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)

                         Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight 

                         in 'em!

               We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

                                     ZED (O.S.)

                         You wanna fight? You wanna fight? 

                         Good, I like to fight!

               Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, 

               hurriedly struggles to get free.

               The Gimp is laughing wildly.

               The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

               The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)

                         That's it... that's it boy, you're 

                         goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like 

                         that... that's good.

                              (grunting faster)

                         Stay still... stay still goddamn ya! 

                         Zed goddammit, git over here and 

                         hold 'em!

               Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite 

               easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it 

               were never connected by a bolt.

               The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

                                     THE GIMP

                         Huhng?

               The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. 

               He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles 

               and grunts.

               Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S 

               PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making 

               him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash 

               attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then 

               silently makes his way through the red curtains.

               INT. PAWNSHOP  DAY

               Butch sneaks to the door.

               On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected 

               to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he 

               stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their 

               way with Marsellus.

               Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in 

               a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the 

               pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in 

               with.

               He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards 

               it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks 

               about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large 

               Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots 

               what he's been looking for:

               A Samurai sword.

               It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the 

               wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. 

               Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its 

               sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten 

               in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his 

               thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not 

               on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems 

               made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the 

               sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears 

               through the red curtains to take care of business.

               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM  DAY

               Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

               Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind 

               the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

               INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM  DAY

               Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It 

               swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched 

               positions.

               Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden 

               horse.

               Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

               Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up 

               behind him with the sword.

               Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, 

               red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see 

               Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

                                     BUTCH

                         Hey hillbilly.

               Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

               Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across 

               the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on 

               Zed.

               Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

               Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword 

               behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing 

               the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

               Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go 

               from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, 

               which lies within reach.

               Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

                                     BUTCH

                         You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

               Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

               Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

               Zed studies Butch.

               Butch looks hard at Zed.

               Then a VOICE says:

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)

                         Step aside, Butch.

               Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him, 

               holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

               KABOOM!!!!

               Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

               Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the 

               used shotgun shell.

               Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

                                     BUTCH

                         You okay?

                                     MARSELLUS

                         Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from 

                         okay!

               Long pause.

                                     BUTCH

                         What now?

                                     MARSELLUS

                         What now? Well let me tell you what 

                         now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-

                         hittin' niggers, who'll go to work 

                         on homes here with a pair of pliers 

                         and a blow torch.

                              (to Zed)

                         Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I 

                         ain't through with you by a damn 

                         sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on 

                         your ass.

                                     BUTCH

                         I meant what now, between me and 

                         you?

                                     MARSELLUS

                         Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell 

                         ya what now between me an' you. There 

                         is no me an' you. Not no more.

                                     BUTCH

                         So we're cool?

                                     MARSELLUS

                         Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I 

                         ask  two things I ask: Don't tell 

                         nobody about this. This shit's between 

                         me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-

                         leave town. Tonight. Right now. And 

                         when you're gone, stay gone.  You've 

                         lost your Los Angeles privileges.  

                         Deal?

                                     BUTCH

                         Deal.

               The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

                                     MARSELLUS

                         Go on now, get your ass outta here.

               Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

               Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

                                     MARSELLUS

                              (into the phone)

                         Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta 

                         bit of a situation.

               EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP  DAY

               Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He 

               looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, 

               Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has 

               the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys 

               with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES 

               to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit. 

               Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

               WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

               INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM  DAY

               Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says, 

               Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a 

               BOOM BOX.

               EXT. CITY STREET  CHOPPER (MOVING)  DAY

               Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE." 

               He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

               The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

               EXT. MOTEL ROOM  DAY

               Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the 

               motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)

                         Butch, I was so worried!

                                     BUTCH

                         Honey, grab your radio and your purse 

                         and let's go!

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)

                         But what about all our bags?

                                     BUTCH

                         Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train 

                         if we don't split now.

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)

                         Is everything well? Are we in danger?

                                     BUTCH

                         We're cool. In fact, we're super-

                         cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait 

                         for you outside.

               Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the 

               motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she 

               sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Where did you get this motorcycle?

                                     BUTCH

                              (he kick-starts it)

                         It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

               Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

                                     FABIENNE

                         What happened to my Honda?

                                     BUTCH

                         Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

                                     FABIENNE

                         You're hurt?

                                     BUTCH

                         I might've broke my nose, no biggie. 

                         Hop on.

               She doesn't move.

               Butch looks at her.

                                     BUTCH

                         Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

               Fabienne starts to cry.

               Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the 

               bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her 

               hand.

                                     BUTCH

                         I'm sorry, baby-love.

                                     FABIENNE

                              (crying)

                         You were gone so long, I started to 

                         think dreadful thoughts.

                                     BUTCH

                         I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.

                         Everything's fine. Hey, how was 

                         breakfast?

                                     FABIENNE

                              (waterworks drying a 

                              little)

                         It was good 

                                     BUTCH

                          did you get the blueberry pancakes?

                                     FABIENNE

                         No, they didn't have blueberry 

                         pancakes, I had to get buttermilk  

                         are you sure you're okay?

                                     BUTCH

                         Baby-love, from the moment I left 

                         you, this has been without a doubt 

                         the single weirdest day of my entire 

                         life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about 

                         it.

               Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

                                     BUTCH

                         It's a chopper.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Whose chopper is this?

                                     BUTCH

                         Zed's.

                                     FABIENNE

                         Who's Zed?

                                     BUTCH

                         Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

               And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the 

               SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               TITLE CARD:

                            "JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF"

               TITLE DISAPPEARS.

               Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.

                                     JULES (O.S.)

                         You ever read the Bible, Brett?

                                     BRETT (O.S.)

                         Yes!

                                     JULES (O.S.)

                         There's a passage I got memorized, 

                         seems appropriate for this situation: 

                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 

                         righteous man is beset on all sides 

                         by the inequities of the selfish and 

                         the tyranny of evil men..."

               FADE UP:

               INT. BATHROOM  DAY

               We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in 

               earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except 

               this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The 

               Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard 

               to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly 

               CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

                                     JULES (O.S.)

                         "...blessed is he who, in the name 

                         of charity and good will, shepherded 

                         the weak through the valley of 

                         darkness. And I will strike down 

                         upon thee with great vengeance and 

                         furious anger those who attempt to 

                         poison and destroy my brothers. And 

                         you will know I am the Lord when I 

                         lay my vengeance upon you."

               BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

               The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the 

               back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow 

               fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough 

               to stick their head through that door.

               Then he listens to them talk.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)

                         Friend of yours?

                                     JULES (O.S.)

                         Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

               Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the 

               door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around 

               is the way to go.

               INT. APARTMENT  DAY

               The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES 

               out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his 

               hand cannon.

                                     FOURTH MAN

                         Die... die... die... die...!

               DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

               He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion 

               crosses his face.

               TWO SHOT  JULES AND VINCENT

               Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, 

               none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody. 

               Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're 

               as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other, 

               they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

                                     FOURTH MAN

                         I don't understand 

               The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's 

               bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

               The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits 

               down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs 

               it off.

               Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

                                     VINCENT

                         Why the fuck didn't you tell us about 

                         that guy in the bathroom? Slip your 

                         mind?  Forget he was in there with a 

                         goddamn hand cannon?

                                     JULES

                              (to himself)

                         We should be fuckin' dead right now.

                              (pause)

                         Did you see that gun he fired at us? 

                         It was bigger than him.

                                     VINCENT

                         .357.

                                     JULES

                         We should be fuckin' dead!

                                     VINCENT

                         Yeah, we were lucky.

               Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

                                     JULES

                         That shit wasn't luck. That shit was 

                         somethin' else.

               Vincent prepares to leave.

                                     VINCENT

                         Yeah, maybe.

                                     JULES

                         That was... divine intervention. You 

                         know what divine intervention is?

                                     VINCENT

                         Yeah, I think so. That means God 

                         came down from Heaven and stopped 

                         the bullets.

                                     JULES

                         Yeah, man, that's what is means. 

                         That's exactly what it means! God 

                         came down from Heaven and stopped 

                         the bullets.

                                     VINCENT

                         I think we should be going now.

                                     JULES

                         Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do 

                         that!  Don't blow this shit off! 

                         What just happened was a fuckin' 

                         miracle!

                                     VINCENT

                         Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit 

                         happens.

                                     JULES

                         Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just 

                         happen.

                                     VINCENT

                         Do you wanna continue this theological 

                         discussion in the car, or at the 

                         jailhouse with the cops?

                                     JULES

                         We should be fuckin' dead now, my 

                         friend!  We just witnessed a miracle, 

                         and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge 

                         it!

                                     VINCENT

                         Okay man, it was a miracle, can we 

                         leave now?

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING  MORNING

               The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

               INT. NOVA (MOVING)  MORNING

               Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and 

               Marvin in the back.

                                     VINCENT

                         ...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I 

                         was watchin' it once and this cop 

                         was on it who was talkin' about this 

                         time he got into this gun fight with 

                         a guy in a hallway. He unloads on 

                         this guy and he doesn't hit anything. 

                         And these guys were in a hallway. 

                         It's a freak, but it happens.

                                     JULES

                         If you wanna play blind man, then go 

                         walk with a Shepherd. But me, my 

                         eyes are wide fuckin' open.

                                     VINCENT

                         What the fuck does that mean?

                                     JULES

                         That's it for me. For here on in, 

                         you can consider my ass retired.

                                     VINCENT

                         Jesus Christ!

                                     JULES

                         Don't blaspheme!

                                     VINCENT

                         Goddammit, Jules 

                                     JULES

                          I said don't do that 

                                     VINCENT

                          you're fuckin' freakin' out!

                                     JULES

                         I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm 

                         through.

                                     VINCENT

                         While you're at it, be sure to tell 

                         'im why.

                                     JULES

                         Don't worry, I will.

                                     VINCENT

                         I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he 

                         laughs his ass off.

                                     JULES

                         I don't give a damn if he does.

               Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his 

               grip.

                                     VINCENT

                         Marvin, what do you make of all this?

                                     MARVIN

                         I don't even have an opinion.

                                     VINCENT

                         C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came 

                         down from Heaven and stopped the 

                         bullets?

               Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

               Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES 

               blood and SHAKES.

                                     JULES

                         What the fuck's happening?

                                     VINCENT

                         I just accidentally shot Marvin in 

                         the throat.

                                     JULES

                         Why the fuck did you do that?

                                     VINCENT

                         I didn't mean to do it. I said it 

                         was an accident.

                                     JULES

                         I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in 

                         my time 

                                     VINCENT

                          chill out, man, it was an accident, 

                         okay? You hit a bump or somethin' 

                         and the gun went off.

                                     JULES

                         The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' 

                         bump!

                                     VINCENT

                         Look! I didn't mean to shoot this 

                         son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went 

                         off, don't ask me how!

                                     JULES

                         Look at this mess! We're drivin' 

                         around on a city street in broad 

                         daylight 

                                     VINCENT

                          I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' 

                         about the splatter.

                                     JULES

                         Well you better be thinkin' about it 

                         now, motherfucker! We gotta get this 

                         car off the road. Cops tend to notice 

                         shit like you're driving a car 

                         drenched in fuckin' blood.

                                     VINCENT

                         Can't we just take it to a friendly 

                         place?

                                     JULES

                         This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus 

                         don't got no friendly places in the 

                         Valley.

                                     VINCENT

                         Well, don't look at me, this is your 

                         town, Jules.

               Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

                                     VINCENT

                         Who ya callin'?

                                     JULES

                         A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

                                     VINCENT

                         Where's Toluca Lake.

                                     JULES

                         On the other side of the hill, by 

                         Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass 

                         ain't home, I don't know what the 

                         fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any 

                         other partners in 818.

                              (into phone)

                         Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.

                              (pause)

                         Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are 

                         in some serious shit. We're in a car 

                         we gotta get off the road, pronto! I 

                         need to use your garage for a couple 

                         hours.

               INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM  DAY

               Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while 

               Vincent stands behind him.

                                     JULES

                         We gotta be real fuckin' delicate 

                         with this Jimmie's situation. He's 

                         one remark away from kickin' our 

                         asses out the door.

                                     VINCENT

                         If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

                                     JULES

                         Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made 

                         a couple phone calls. But I never 

                         want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's 

                         my friend and you don't bust in your 

                         friend's house and start tellin' 'im 

                         what's what.

               Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at 

               the sink.

                                     VINCENT

                         Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He 

                         kinda freaked out back there when he 

                         saw Marvin.

                                     JULES

                         Put yourself in his position. It's 

                         eight o'clock in the morning. He 

                         just woke up, he wasn't prepared for 

                         this shit. Don't forget who's doin' 

                         who a favor.

               Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

                                     VINCENT

                         If the price of that favor is I gotta 

                         take shit, he can stick his favor 

                         straight up his ass.

               When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is 

               stained with red.

                                     JULES

                         What the fuck did you just do to his 

                         towel?

                                     VINCENT

                         I was just dryin' my hands.

                                     JULES

                         You're supposed to wash 'em first.

                                     VINCENT

                         You watched me wash 'em.

                                     JULES

                         I watched you get 'em wet.

                                     VINCENT

                         I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to 

                         get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, 

                         I coulda done a better job.

                                     JULES

                         I used the same soap you did and 

                         when I dried my hands, the towel 

                         didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie 

                         pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who 

                         cares? But it's shit like this that's 

                         gonna bring this situation to a boil. 

                         If he were to come in here and see 

                         that towel like that... I'm tellin' 

                         you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause 

                         if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie 

                         on account of you... Look, I ain't 

                         threatenin' you, I respect you an' 

                         all, just don't put me in that 

                         position.

                                     JULES

                         Jules, you ask me nice like that, no 

                         problem. He's your friend, you handle 

                         him.

               INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN  MORNING

               Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug 

               of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in 

               his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

                                     JULES

                         Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious 

                         gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda 

                         been satisfied with freeze-dried 

                         Tasters Choice. You spring this 

                         gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What 

                         flavor is this?

                                     JIMMIE

                         Knock it off, Julie.

                                     JULES

                         What?

                                     JIMMIE

                         I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can 

                         stop butterin' me up. I don't need 

                         you to tell me how good my coffee 

                         is. I'm the one who buys it, I know 

                         how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie 

                         goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy 

                         the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause 

                         when I drink it, I wanna taste it. 

                         But what's on my mind at this moment 

                         isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's 

                         the dead nigger in my garage.

                                     JULES

                         Jimmie 

                                     JIMMIE

                          I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a 

                         question, Jules. When you drove in 

                         here, did you notice a sign out front 

                         that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

               Jules starts to "Jimmie" him 

                                     JIMMIE

                          answer to question. Did you see a 

                         sign out in front of my house that 

                         said, "Dead nigger storage?"

                                     JULES

                              (playing along)

                         Naw man, I didn't.

                                     JIMMIE

                         You know why you didn't see that 

                         sign?

                                     JULES

                         Why?

                                     JIMMIE

                         'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my 

                         fuckin' business!

               Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.

                                     JIMMIE

                          I ain't through! Now don't you 

                         understand that if Bonnie comes home 

                         and finds a dead body in her house, 

                         I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage 

                         counselor, no trial separation  

                         fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna 

                         get fuckin' divorced. The last time 

                         me an' Bonnie talked about this shit 

                         was gonna be the last time me an' 

                         Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I 

                         wanna help ya out Julie, I really 

                         do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife 

                         doin' it.

                                     JULES

                         Jimmie 

                                     JIMMIE

                          don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I 

                         can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' 

                         you can say that's gonna make me 

                         forget I love my wife. Now she's 

                         workin' the graveyard shift at the 

                         hospital. She'll be comin' home in 

                         less than an hour and a half. Make 

                         your phone calls, talk to your people, 

                         than get the fuck out of my house.

                                     JULES

                         That's all we want. We don't wanna 

                         fuck up your shit. We just need to 

                         call our people to bring us in.

                                     JIMMIE

                         Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's 

                         in my bedroom.

               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM  MORNING

               Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy 

               robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

                                     MARSELLUS

                         ...well, say she comes home. Whaddya 

                         think she'll do?

                              (pause)

                         No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That 

                         ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, 

                         I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

               INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM  MORNING

               Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

                                     JULES

                         You got to appreciate what an 

                         explosive element this Bonnie 

                         situation is. If she comes home from 

                         a hard day's work and finds a bunch 

                         of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' 

                         shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' 

                         what she's apt to do.

                                     MARSELLUS

                         I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm 

                         doin' is contemplating the "ifs."

                                     JULES

                         I don't wanna hear about no 

                         motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna 

                         hear from your ass is: "you ain't 

                         got no problems, Jules. I'm on the 

                         motherfucker. Go back in there, chill 

                         them niggers out and wait for the 

                         cavalry, which should be comin' 

                         directly."

                                     MARSELLUS

                         You ain't got no problems, Jules. 

                         I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in 

                         there, chill them niggers out and 

                         wait for The Wolf, who should be 

                         comin' directly.

                                     JULES

                         You sendin' The Wolf?

                                     MARSELLUS

                         Feel better?

                                     JULES

                         Shit Negro, that's all you had to 

                         say.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE  MORNING

               The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite 

               into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a 

               fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in 

               fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing: 

               Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the 

               tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka "THE WOLF". We also see The 

               Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

                                     THE WOLF

                              (into phone)

                         Is she the hysterical type?

                              (pause)

                         When she due?

                              (jotting down)

                         Give me the principals' names again?

                              (jots down)

                         Jules...

               We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

                            "1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head) 

                            Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)"

                                     THE WOLF

                         ...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

               HE WRITES:

                   "Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)"

                                     THE WOLF

                         Expect a call around 10:30. It's 

                         about thirty minutes away. I'll be 

                         there in ten.

               He hangs up. We never see his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

                      "NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET  MORNING

               A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home, 

               in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a 

               dime in front of Jimmie's house.

               A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

               INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE  MORNING

               Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the 

               tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at 

               Jimmie.

                                     THE WOLF

                         You're Jimmie, right? This is your 

                         house?

                                     JIMMIE

                         Yeah.

                                     THE WOLF

                              (stick his hand out)

                         I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

                                     JIMMIE

                         Good, 'cause we got one.

                                     THE WOLF

                         So I heard. May I come in?

                                     JIMMIE

                         Please do.

               In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

                                     THE WOLF

                         You must be Jules, which would make 

                         you Vincent. Let's get down to brass 

                         tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed 

                         correctly, the clock is ticking, is 

                         that right, Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE

                         100%.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Your wife, Bonnie...

                              (refers to his pad)

                         ...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is 

                         that correct?

                                     JIMMIE

                         Uh-huh.

                                     THE WOLF

                         I was led to believe if she comes 

                         home and finds us here, she wouldn't 

                         appreciate it none too much.

                                     JIMMIE

                         She won't at that.

                                     THE WOLF

                         That gives us forty minutes to get 

                         the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you 

                         do what I say when I say it, should 

                         by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a 

                         car, minus a head, in a garage. Take 

                         me to it.

               INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE  MORNING

               The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He 

               studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, 

               circling it.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE

                         Yes.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I 

                         smelled some coffee in there. Would 

                         you make me a cup?

                                     JIMMIE

                         Sure, how do you take it?

                                     THE WOLF

                         Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

               Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

                                     THE WOLF

                         About the car, is there anything I 

                         need to know? Does it stall, does it 

                         make a lot of noise, does it smoke, 

                         is there gas in it, anything?

                                     JULES

                         Aside from how it looks, the car's 

                         cool.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Positive?  Don't get me out on the 

                         road and I find out the brake lights 

                         don't work.

                                     JULES

                         Hey man, as far as I know, the 

                         motherfucker's tip-top.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Good enough, let's go back to the 

                         kitchen.

               INT. KITCHEN  MORNING

               Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Thank you, Jimmie.

               He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the 

               three men the plan of action.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Okay first thing, you two.

                              (meaning Jules and 

                              Vincent)

                         Take the body, stick it in the trunk. 

                         Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty 

                         domesticated house. That would lead 

                         me to believe that in the garage or 

                         under the sink, you got a bunch of 

                         cleansers and cleaners and shit like 

                         that, am I correct?

                                     JIMMIE

                         Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Good. What I need you two fellas to 

                         do is take those cleaning products 

                         and clean the inside of the car. And 

                         I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You 

                         need to go in the backseat, scoop up 

                         all those little pieces of brain and 

                         skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe 

                         down the upholstery  now when it 

                         comes to upholstery, it don't need 

                         to be spic and span, you don't need 

                         to eat off it. Give it a good once 

                         over. What you need to take care of 

                         are the really messy parts. The pools 

                         of blood that have collected, you 

                         gotta soak that shit up.  But the 

                         windows are a different story.  Them 

                         you really clean. Get the Windex, do 

                         a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to 

                         raid your linen closet. I need 

                         blankets, I need comforters, I need 

                         quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker 

                         the better, the darker the better. 

                         No whites, can't use 'em. We need to 

                         camouflage the interior of the car. 

                         We're gonna line the front seat and 

                         the backseat and the floor boards 

                         with quilts and blankets. If a cop 

                         stops us and starts stickin' his big 

                         snout in the car, the subterfuge 

                         won't last. But at a glance, the car 

                         will appear to be normal.  Jimmie  

                         lead the way, boys  get to work.

               The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving 

               Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

                                     VINCENT

                              (calling after him)

                         A "please" would be nice.

               The Wolf stops and turns around.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Come again?

                                     VINCENT

                         I said a "please" would be nice.

               The Wolf takes a step toward him.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Set is straight, Buster. I'm not 

                         here to say "please."I'm here to 

                         tell you want to do. And if self-

                         preservation is an instinct you 

                         possess, you better fuckin' do it 

                         and do it quick. I'm here to help.

                         If my help's not appreciated, lotsa 

                         luck gentlemen.

                                     JULES

                         It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your 

                         help is definitely appreciated.

                                     VINCENT

                         I don't mean any disrespect. I just 

                         don't like people barkin' orders at 

                         me.

                                     THE WOLF

                         If I'm curt with you, it's because 

                         time is a factor. I think fast, I 

                         talk fast, and I need you guys to 

                         act fast if you want to get out of 

                         this. So pretty please, with sugar 

                         on top, clean the fuckin' car.

               INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM  MORNING

               Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he 

               has.

               The Wolf is on the phone.

                                     THE WOLF

                              (into phone)

                         It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

                              (pause)

                         White.

                              (pause)

                         Nothin', except for the mess inside.

                              (pause)

                         About twenty minutes.

                              (pause)

                         Nobody who'll be missed.

                              (pause)

                         You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.

                              (he looks at Jimmie)

                         How we comin', Jimmie?

               Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

                                     JIMMIE

                         Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand 

                         somethin' 

                                     THE WOLF

                          Winston, Jimmie  please, Winston.

                                     JIMMIE

                         You gotta understand something, 

                         Winston. I want to help you guys out 

                         and all, but that's my best linen. 

                         It was a wedding present from my 

                         Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and 

                         they ain't with us anymore 

                                     THE WOLF

                          let me ask you a question, if you 

                         don't mind?

                                     JIMMIE

                         Sure.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny 

                         millionaires?

                                     JIMMIE

                         No.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And 

                         I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and 

                         Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they 

                         would've furnished you with a whole 

                         bedroom set, which your Uncle 

                         Marsellus is more than happy to do.

                              (takes out a roll of 

                              bills)

                         I like oak myself, that's what's in 

                         my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, 

                         you an oak man?

                                     JIMMIE

                         Oak's nice.

               INT. GARAGE  MORNING

               Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. 

               Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is 

               in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs 

               of brain.

               Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

                                     JULES

                         I will never forgive your ass for 

                         this shit. This is some fucked-up 

                         repugnant shit!

                                     VINCENT

                         Did you ever hear the philosophy 

                         that once a man admits he's wrong, 

                         he's immediately forgiven for all 

                         wrong-doings?

                                     JULES

                         Man, get outta my face with that 

                         shit! The motherfucker who said that 

                         never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces 

                         of skull with his fingers on account 

                         of your dumb ass.

                                     VINCENT

                         I got a threshold, Jules. I got a 

                         threshold for the abuse I'll take. 

                         And you're crossin' it. I'm a race 

                         car and you got me in the red. Redline 

                         7000, that's where you are. Just 

                         know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be 

                         drivin' a race car when it's in the 

                         red. It could blow.

                                     JULES

                         You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a 

                         mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!  

                         Every time my fingers touch brain 

                         I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS 

                         OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker 

                         usta talk about. In fact, what the 

                         fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're 

                         the motherfucker should be on brain 

                         detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' 

                         windows and you're pickin' up this 

                         nigger's skull.

               INT. CHEVY NOVA  MORNING

               The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with 

               bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a 

               portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript 

               vehicle.

               The Wolf circles the car examining it.

               Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a 

               bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a 

               good job they've done.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out 

                         of this yet.

                                     JIMMIE

                         I can't believe that's the same car.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Well, let's not start suckin' each 

                         other's dicks quite yet. Phase one 

                         is complete, clean the car, which 

                         moves us right along to phase two, 

                         clean you two.

               EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD  MORNING

               Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, 

               covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic 

               Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one 

               of those guns nozzles attached.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Strip.

                                     VINCENT

                         All the way?

                                     THE WOLF

                         To your bare ass.

               As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Quickly gentlemen, we got about 

                         fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-

                         half comes pulling into the driveway.

                                     JULES

                         This morning air is some chilly shit.

                                     VINCENT

                         Are you sure this is absolutely 

                         necessary?

                                     THE WOLF

                         You know what you two look like?

                                     VINCENT

                         What?

                                     THE WOLF

                         Like a couple of guys who just blew 

                         off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' 

                         off those bloody rags is absolutely 

                         necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's 

                         garbage bag.

                                     JULES

                         Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid 

                         like puttin' that out in front of 

                         your house for Elmo the garbage man 

                         to take away.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Don't worry, we're takin' it with 

                         us. Jim, the soap.

               He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Okay gentlemen, you're both been to 

                         County before, I'm sure. Here it 

                         comes.

               He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

                                     JULES

                         Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

                                     THE WOLF

                         Better you than me, gentlemen.

               The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Don't be afraid of the soap, spread 

                         it around.

               The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Towel 'em.

               Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously 

               across their bodies.

                                     THE WOLF

                         You're dry enough, give 'em their 

                         clothes.

               FADE UP ON:

               JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They 

               look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses 

               we first met.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've 

                         planned this better. You guys look 

                         like... what do they look like, 

                         Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE

                         Dorks. They look like a couple of 

                         dorks.

               The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

                                     JULES

                         Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, 

                         motherfucker.

                                     JIMMIE

                         I guess you just gotta know how to 

                         wear them.

                                     JULES

                         Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert 

                         on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

                                     THE WOLF

                         C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and 

                         jokin' our way into prison. Don't 

                         make me beg.

               INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE  MORNING

               The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin. 

               The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Gentlemen, let's get our rules of 

                         the road straight. We're going to a 

                         place called Monster Joe's Truck and 

                         Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter 

                         Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.  

                         The place is North Hollywood, so a 

                         few twist and turns aside, we'll be 

                         goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll 

                         drive the tainted car. Jules, you 

                         ride with me.  Vincent, you follow 

                         in my Porsche. Now if we cross the 

                         path of any John Q. Laws, nobody 

                         does a fuckin' thing 'til I do 

                         something.

                                     (TO JULES)

                         What did I say?

                                     JULES

                         Don't do shit unless 

                                     THE WOLF

                          unless what?

                                     JULES

                         Unless you do it first.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Spoken like a true prodigy.

                              (to Vincent)

                         How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you 

                         keep your spurs from jingling and 

                         jangling?

                                     VINCENT

                         I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went 

                         off, I dunno how.

                                     THE WOLF

                         Fair enough.

                              (he throws Vince his 

                              car keys)

                         I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep 

                         up. If I get my car back any different 

                         than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna 

                         be disposing of two bodies.

               EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW  MORNING

               Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

                                     JULES

                         We cool?

                                     WINSTON

                         Like it never happened.

               Jules and Vincent bump fists.

                                     WINSTON

                         Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all 

                         this will be hers.

                                     RAQUEL

                              (to the boys)

                         Hi. You know, if they ever do "I 

                         SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys, 

                         I'd be great.  What's with the 

                         outfits. You guys going to a 

                         volleyball game?

               Winston laughs, the boys groan.

                                     WINSTON

                         I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. 

                         Maybe I can drop you two off. Where 

                         do you live?

                                     VINCENT

                         Redondo Beach.

                                     JULES

                         Inglewood.

               Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a 

               "DEAD ZONE" trance.

                                     WINSTON

                              (painfully)

                         It's your future: I see... a cab 

                         ride.

                              (dropping the act)

                         Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.

                              (to Raquel)

                         Say goodbye, Raquel.

                                     RAQUEL

                         Goodbye, Raquel.

                                     WINSTON

                         I'll see you two around, and stay 

                         outta trouble, you crazy kids.

               Winston turns to leave.

                                     JULES

                         Mr. Wolf.

               He turns around.

                                     JULES

                         I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

               The Wolf smiles.

                                     WINSTON

                         Call me Winston.

               He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

                                     WINSTON

                         You hear that, young lady? Respect. 

                         You could lean a lot from those two 

                         fine specimens. Respect for one's 

                         elders shows character.

                                     RAQUEL

                         I have character.

                                     WINSTON

                         Just because you are a character 

                         doesn't mean you have character.

                                     RAQUEL

                         Oh you're so funny, oh you're so 

                         funny.

               The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

               The two men left alone look at each other.

                                     JULES

                         Wanna share a cab?

                                     VINCENT

                         You know I could go for some 

                         breakfast.  Want to have breakfast 

                         with me?

                                     JULES

                         Sure.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING

               Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a 

               big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. 

               Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a 

               muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a 

               refill for both men,

                                     VINCENT

                         Thanks a bunch.

                              (to Jules, who's 

                              nursing his coffee)

                         Want a sausage?

                                     JULES

                         Naw, I don't eat pork.

                                     VINCENT

                         Are you Jewish?

                                     JULES

                         I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig 

                         on swine.

                                     VINCENT

                         Why not?

                                     JULES

                         They're filthy animals. I don't eat 

                         filthy animals.

                                     VINCENT

                         Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste 

                         good.

                                     JULES

                         A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin 

                         pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if 

                         it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy 

                         motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in 

                         shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't 

                         wanna eat nothin' that ain't got 

                         enough sense to disregard its own 

                         feces.

                                     VINCENT

                         How about dogs? Dogs eat their own 

                         feces.

                                     JULES

                         I don't eat dog either.

                                     VINCENT

                         Yes, but do you consider a dog to be 

                         a filthy animal?

                                     JULES

                         I wouldn't go so far as to call a 

                         dog filthy, but they're definitely 

                         dirty. But a dog's got personality. 

                         And personality goes a long way.

                                     VINCENT

                         So by that rationale, if a pig had a 

                         better personality, he's cease to be 

                         a filthy animal?

                                     JULES

                         We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one 

                         motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd 

                         have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

               The two men laugh.

                                     VINCENT

                         Good for you. Lighten up a little. 

                         You been sittin' there all quiet.

                                     JULES

                         I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

                                     VINCENT

                              (mouthful of food)

                         About what?

                                     JULES

                         The miracle we witnessed.

                                     VINCENT

                         The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed 

                         a freak occurrence.

                                     JULES

                         Do you know that a miracle is?

                                     VINCENT

                         An act of God.

                                     JULES

                         What's an act of God?

                                     VINCENT

                         I guess it's when God makes the 

                         impossible possible. And I'm sorry 

                         Jules, but I don't think what happened 

                         this morning qualifies.

                                     JULES

                         Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't 

                         matter. You're judging this thing 

                         the wrong way. It's not about what. 

                         It could be God stopped the bullets, 

                         he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found 

                         my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge 

                         shit like this based on merit. Whether 

                         or not what we experienced was an 

                         according-to-Hoyle miracle is 

                         insignificant. What is significant 

                         is I felt God's touch, God got 

                         involved.

                                     VINCENT

                         But why?

                                     JULES

                         That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I 

                         don't know why. But I can't go back 

                         to sleep.

                                     VINCENT

                         So you're serious, you're really 

                         gonna quit?

                                     JULES

                         The life, most definitely.

               Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In 

               the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

                                     PATRON

                         Garcon! Coffee!

               We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene 

               of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

                                     VINCENT

                         So if you're quitting the life, 

                         what'll you do?

                                     JULES

                         That's what I've been sitting here 

                         contemplating. First, I'm gonna 

                         deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, 

                         basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

                                     VINCENT

                         What do you mean, walk the earth?

                                     JULES

                         You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." 

                         Just walk from town to town, meet 

                         people, get in adventures.

                                     VINCENT

                         How long do you intend to walk the 

                         earth?

                                     JULES

                         Until God puts me where he want me 

                         to be.

                                     VINCENT

                         What if he never does?

                                     JULES

                         If it takes forever, I'll wait 

                         forever.

                                     VINCENT

                         So you decided to be a bum?

                                     JULES

                         I'll just be Jules, Vincent  no 

                         more, no less.

                                     VINCENT

                         No Jules, you're gonna be like those 

                         pieces of shit out there who beg for 

                         change. They walk around like a bunch 

                         of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in 

                         garbage bins, they eat what I throw 

                         away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got 

                         a word for 'em, they're called bums. 

                         And without a job, residence, or 

                         legal tender, that's what you're 

                         gonna be  a fuckin' bum!

                                     JULES

                         Look my friend, this is just where 

                         me and you differ 

                                     VINCENT

                          what happened was peculiar  no 

                         doubt about it  but it wasn't water 

                         into wine.

                                     JULES

                         All shapes and sizes, Vince.

                                     VINCENT

                         Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

                                     JULES

                         If you find my answers frightening, 

                         Vincent, you should cease askin' 

                         scary questions.

                                     VINCENT

                         I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

               Vincent exits for the restroom.

               Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin 

               and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

                                     HONEY BUNNY

                         Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 

                         I'll execute every one of you 

                         motherfuckers!  Got that?!

               Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the 

               table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it 

               out, COCKING IT.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         Customers stay seated, waitresses on 

                         the floor.

                                     HONEY BUNNY

                         Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, 

                         do it or fucking die!

               Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While 

               Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them 

               terrified.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out 

                         here!  Asta luego!

               Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         On the floor or I'll cook you ass, 

                         comprende?

               They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

                                     MANAGER

                         I'm the manager here, there's no 

                         problem, no problem at all 

               Pumpkin heads his way.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         You're gonna give me a problem?

               He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the 

               Manager's neck.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         What? You said you're gonna give me 

                         a problem?

                                     MANAGER

                         No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you 

                         any problem!

                                     PUMPKIN

                         I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks 

                         like the hero type to me!

                                     HONEY BUNNY

                         Don't take any chances. Execute him!

               The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his 

               hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

                                     MANAGER

                         Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm 

                         just a coffee shop manager. Take 

                         anything you want.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll 

                         be all over.

                                     MANAGER

                         Everybody just be calm and cooperate 

                         with them and this will be all over 

                         soon!

                                     PUMPKIN

                         Well done, now git your fuckin' ass 

                         on the ground.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM  MORNING

               Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside, 

               reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING

               Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from 

               the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter 

               with a trash bag in his hand.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         Okay people, I'm going to go 'round 

                         and collect your wallets. Don't talk, 

                         just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

               Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his 

               .45 ready to spit under the table.

               Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, 

               briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more 

               respectful, him manner more on guard.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         In the bag.

               Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, 

               Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         What's in that?

                                     JULES

                         My boss' dirty laundry.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         You boss makes you do his laundry?

                                     JULES

                         When he wants it clean.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         Sounds like a shit job.

                                     JULES

                         Funny, I've been thinkin' the same 

                         thing.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         Open it up.

               Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

                                     JULES

                         'Fraid I can't do that.

               Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the 

               gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the 

               hammer.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         I didn't hear you.

                                     JULES

                         Yes, you did.

               This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard 

               it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

                                     HONEY BUNNY

                         What's goin' on?

                                     PUMPKIN

                         Looks like we got a vigilante in our 

                         midst.

                                     HONEY BUNNY

                         Shoot 'em in the face!

                                     JULES

                         I don't mean to shatter your ego, 

                         but this ain't the first time I've 

                         had gun pointed at me.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         You don't open up that case, it's 

                         gonna be the last.

                                     MANAGER

                              (on the ground)

                         Quit causing problems, you'll get us 

                         all killed! Give 'em what you got 

                         and get 'em out of here.

                                     JULES

                         Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat 

                         man, this ain't any of your goddamn 

                         business!

                                     PUMPKIN

                         I'm countin' to three, and if your 

                         hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna 

                         unload right in your fuckin' face. 

                         Clear? One...

                                     PUMPKIN

                         ...two... three.

                                     JULES

                         You win.

               Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

                                     JULES

                         It's all yours, Ringo.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         Open it.

               Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to 

               Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. 

               Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across 

               the room, can't see shit.

                                     HONEY BUNNY

                         What is it? What is it?

                                     PUMPKIN

                              (softly)

                         Is that what I think it is?

               Jules nods his head: "yes."

                                     PUMPKIN

                         It's beautiful.

               Jules nods his head: "yes."

                                     HONEY BUNNY

                         Goddammit, what is it?

               Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering 

               the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to 

               pick up the case.

               Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of 

               Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand 

               comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 

               hand under Pumpkin's chin.

               Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

                                     HONEY BUNNY

                         Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow 

                         your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! 

                         I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're 

                         gonna fuckin' die bad!

                                     JULES

                              (to Pumpkin)

                         Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, 

                         bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

                                     PUMPKIN

                         Chill out, honey!

                                     HONEY BUNNY

                         Let him go!

                                     JULES

                              (softly)

                         Tell her it's gonna be okay.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         I'm gonna be okay.

                                     JULES

                         Promise her.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         I promise.

                                     JULES

                         Tell her to chill.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         Just chill out.

                                     JULES

                         What's her name?

                                     PUMPKIN

                         Yolanda.

               Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only 

               at Pumpkin.

                                     JULES

                              (to Yolanda)

                         So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna 

                         do anything stupid, are we?

                                     YOLANDA

                              (crying)

                         Don't you hurt him.

                                     JULES

                         Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're 

                         gonna be like three Fonzies. And 

                         what' Fonzie like?

               No answer.

                                     JULES

                         C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

                                     YOLANDA

                              (through tears, unsure)

                         He's cool?

                                     JULES

                         Correct-amundo! And that's what we're 

                         gonna be, we're gonna be cool.

                              (to Pumpkin)

                         Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three 

                         and I want you to let go your gun 

                         and lay your palms flat on the table. 

                         But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

               Pumpkin looks at him.

                                     JULES

                         One... two... three.

               Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

               Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

                                     YOLANDA

                         Okay, now let him go!

                                     JULES

                         Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be 

                         cool.  When you yell at me, it makes 

                         me nervous.  When I get nervous, I 

                         get scared. And when motherfuckers 

                         get scared, that's when motherfuckers 

                         get accidentally shot.

                                     YOLANDA

                              (more conversational)

                         Just know: you hurt him, you die.

                                     JULES

                         That seems to be the situation. Now 

                         I don't want that and you don't want 

                         that and Ringo here don't want that. 

                         So let's see what we can do.

                              (to Ringo)

                         Now this is the situation. Normally 

                         both of your asses would be dead as 

                         fuckin' fried chicken. But you 

                         happened to pull this shit while I'm 

                         in a transitional period. I don't 

                         wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. 

                         But I'm afraid I can't give you the 

                         case. It don't belong to me. Besides, 

                         I went through too much shit this 

                         morning on account of this case to 

                         just hand it over to your ass.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)

                         What the fuck's goin' on here?

               Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

               Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at 

               Yolanda.

                                     JULES

                         It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't 

                         do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's 

                         cool baby, nothin's changed. We're 

                         still just talkin'.

                              (to Pumpkin)

                         Tell her we're still cool.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still 

                         cool.

                                     VINCENT

                              (gun raised)

                         What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

                                     JULES

                         Nothin' I can't handle. I want you 

                         to just hang back and don't do shit 

                         unless it's absolutely necessary.

                                     VINCENT

                         Check.

                                     JULES

                         Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

                                     YOLANDA

                         I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

                                     JULES

                         Just hang in there, baby, you're 

                         doing' great, Ringo's proud of you 

                         and so am I.  It's almost over.

                              (to Pumpkin)

                         Now I want you to go in that bag and 

                         find my wallet.

                                     PUMPKIN

                         Which one is it?

                                     JULES

                         It's the one that says Bad 

                         Motherfucker on it.

               Pumpkin looks in the bag and  sure enough  there's a wallet 

               with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

                                     JULES

                         That's my bad motherfucker. Now open 

                         it up and take out the cash. How 

                         much is there?

                                     PUMPKIN

                         About fifteen hundred dollars.

                                     JULES

                         Put it in your pocket, it's yours. 

                         Now with the rest of them wallets 

                         and the register, that makes this a 

                         pretty successful little score.

                                     VINCENT

                         Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen 

                         hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on 

                         general principle.

                                     JULES

                         You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, 

                         now hang back and shut the fuck up. 

                         Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. 

                         I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. 

                         Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

                                     PUMPKIN

                         What?

                                     JULES

                         Your life. I'm givin' you that money 

                         so I don't hafta kill your ass. You 

                         read the Bible?

                                     PUMPKIN

                         Not regularly.

                                     JULES

                         There's a passage I got memorized. 

                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 

                         righteous man is beset on all sides 

                         by the inequities of the selfish and 

                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 

                         he who, in the name of charity and 

                         good will, shepherds the weak through 

                         the valley of the darkness. For he 

                         is truly his brother's keeper and 

                         the finder of lost children. And I 

                         will strike down upon thee with great 

                         vengeance and furious anger those 

                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 

                         brothers. And you will know I am the 

                         Lord when I lay my vengeance upon 

                         you." I been sayin' that shit for 

                         years.  And if you ever heard it, it 

                         meant your ass. I never really 

                         questioned what it meant. I thought 

                         it was just a coldblooded thing to 

                         say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped 

                         a cap in his ass. But I saw some 

                         shit this mornin' made me think twice. 

                         Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're 

                         the evil man. And I'm the righteous 

                         man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the 

                         shepherd protecting my righteous ass 

                         in the valley of darkness. Or is 

                         could by you're the righteous man 

                         and I'm the shepherd and it's the 

                         world that's evil and selfish.  I'd 

                         like that. But that shit ain't the 

                         truth. The truth is you're the weak. 

                         And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But 

                         I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to 

                         be a shepherd.

               Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

               Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to 

               Yolanda.

               She looks back.

               Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the 

               door.

               Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, 

               takes a sip of coffee.

                                     JULES

                              (to himself)

                         It's cold.

               He pushes it aside.

               Vincent appears next to Jules.

                                     VINCENT

                         I think we oughta leave now.

                                     JULES

                         That's probably a good idea.

               Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the 

               briefcase.

               Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the 

               Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes 

                wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts, 

               swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics  walk out of 

               the coffee shop together without saying a word.

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                         THE END
