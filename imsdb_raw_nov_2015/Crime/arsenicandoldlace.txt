   CREDITS

   Credits roll, in white letters, on several funny cartoons, all of

   them about witches and witchcraft (a caldron over a fire, with two

   witches on either side of it - A close-up of one of the witches -

   A witches falling down from the sky on her broomstick, and loosing

   her hat in the fall - A furious black cat spitting at an owl

   seated on a branch - A carafe with two glasses, actually a direct

   reference to the film - An Halloween pumpkin pressing her two

   forefingers in its ears, with music notes around it - Black bats

   flying over a village).

   BROOKLYN - GENERAL OVERVIEW - EXTERIOR DAY

   A general overview of Brooklyn, near New York, seen from the roof

   of a very high building. Written in white letters on this

   overview, the following words :

                         This is a Hallowe'en

                       tale of Brooklyn, where

                        anything can happen--

                         and it usually does.

   Then :

                           At 3 P.M. on this

                         particular day, this

                             was happening-

   Several white circles move on the screen, then the whole screen is

   covered by a huge base ball, with Brooklyn written on it in

   black letters.

   BASEBALL GAME - SPECTATORS - EXTERIOR DAY

   Close-up of the face of man, screaming :

          BASEBALL FAN

          I'll knock your block off, you big stiff ! You're a bum !

   The camera moves away, so we can see the other baseball spectators

   behind the first one.

   BASEBALL FIELD - EXTERIOR DAY

   General view of a baseball field, where a game is being played.

   Follow several very quick sequences (one or two seconds each) : A

   general view of the spectators. Then a player throwing a ball.

   Then a very excited brass band playing. Then a few very excited

   spectators. Then another player throwing a ball.

   Finally we see a batter missing his ball. We hear the Umpire,

   standing behind the catcher and heavily covered with a protection

   suit, yelling :

       THE UMPIRE

       Strike ! You're out !

   The batter, who missed the ball, drops his bat on the ground and

   comes back to the Umpire. He tears the Umpire helmet and mask

   away, and gives him a good punch in the nose. The Umpire falls on

   the ground. The catcher then hits the batter. The Umpire rises

   slowly from the ground.

   Several very quick sequences : The ball-thrower drops his glove

   and runs to the fight. Then several excited spectators stand up to

   join the fight. Several player, who were waiting for their turn to

   go on the field, also run to the fight. Then a view of the fight,

   where all the players are hitting each other. Then the popcorn

   seller, dropping his basket to join the fight. Then spectators

   jumping over the balustrades to join the fight. Then another view

   of the players fighting. Then a final view of the Umpire, laying

   on the field and leaning on one elbow, and quietly munching some

   food.

   NEW YORK - A BRIDGE - EXTERIOR DAY

   We see a large view of a bridge with a white boat passing

   underneath. Written in large white letters on the screen, the

   words :

                      While at the same time

                     across the river in the

                        UNITED STATE PROPER

                      there was a romance in

                              the air.

MARRIAGE LICENSE BUREAU - INTERIOR DAY

Close-up on the sign MARRIAGE LICENSE BUREAU, with people

passing underneath.

       AN EXCITED GIRL VOICE

       Elmer, here it is.

       A MORE QUIET MALE VOICE

       I knew you'd find it.

       ANOTHER MALE VOICE

       Boy, I could sure use a drink.

The camera gets down from the sign to floor level. Two journalists

are approaching, one equipped with a camera.

       THE PHOTOGRAPHER

       I wonder if any big shots are getting married today ?

They stop at the door of the room.

Larger view of the room, where several people are, either standing

in a queue, either sitting at a table and filling forms, either

chatting in groups of two or three

Back to the two journalists still standing a the door.

       THE OTHER JOURNALIST

       Looks like the same suckers get married every day.

He looks around for a few second, then starts to move away.

       THE OTHER JOURNALIST

       Come on.

The photographer makes him come back. He points to someone in the

room.

       THE PHOTOGRAPHER

       Hey, the guy with the cheaters.

In a line of people queueing in front of a counter, we see

Mortimer Brewster, with a hat and a pair of large dark glasses. He

turns around and notices the two journalists looking at him. He

raises the collar of his black coat to try to hide his face. The

girl in front of him turns around to look at him. She has blonde

curly hair and wears a hat with a strange white feather. She is

Elaine Harper. With both his hands, Mortimer turns her face back

toward the counter.

Back to the two journalists at the door of the room.

       THE OTHER JOURNALIST

       Now what's he hiding from ?

He starts moving to get a better look at Mortimer.

Mortimer moves in front of Elaine, who smiles.

The two journalists are now in the room, and they look at

Mortimer.

       THE OTHER JOURNALIST

       Hey, isn't that Mortimer Brewster?

       THE PHOTOGRAPHER

       Mortimer Brewster, the dramatic critic ?

Mortimer looks very embarrassed.

Back to the two journalists.

       THE OTHER JOURNALIST

       No, it's not him. But what a scoop it would be ! The guy

       who wrote The Bachelor's Bible finally getting hooked

       himself. Nope. It's too good to be true. Come on, let's

       snap the mayor in his new fire helmet and go home.

       THE PHOTOGRAPHER

       Hey, let's stick around, and see who the guy is.

Back to the line of people waiting in front of the counter. The

marriage clerk is standing behind a set of metal bars. A couple of

people leaves the counter. It's now Mortimer and Elaine's turn.

The marriage clerk sings :

       THE CLERK

       "Two by two they come and go. Hip hip hig hay !"

He smiles to Mortimer and Elaine.

       THE CLERK

       Good morning, children. Your name, please ?

       ELAINE

       Elaine Harper.

She spoke in a very soft voice. The clerk put his hand around his

ear.

        THE CLERK

        Speak a little louder.

She speaks louder.

       ELAINE

       Elaine Harper.

       THE CLERK

       Thank you. Yours ?

Mortimer comes very close to the bars above the counter and

whispers.

       MORTIMER

       Mortimer Brewster.

The clerk puts his hand back around his ear.

The two journalists are straining their own ears to be able to

understand Mortimer's name

       THE CLERK

       How's that ?

Mortimer raises his glasses, but still whispers.

       MORTIMER

       Mortimer Brewster.

       THE CLERK

       Speak up, sonny. There's nothing to be afraid of.

Mortimer bends down, putting his chin at the counter level. Then

he stands up again, and opens the gate in front of the clerk. He

knocks his head on the bar above the gate. He straightens his hat,

and brings his face close to the clerk's one. He still whispers.

       MORTIMER

       I want to keep this undercover.

       THE CLERK

       Love her ? But of course you love her. You're going to

       marry her, aren't you ?

       MORTIMER

       No-no, you don't understand. Come here, come.

With his finger, he signals the clerk to come close to him.

       MORTIMER

       You see, I don't want this to get out for a while. I'm

       Mortimer Brewster.

       THE CLERK

       You're who ?

Mortimer stops controlling himself and starts yelling

       MORTIMER

       Mortimer Brew...

He doesn't finish telling his name, takes Elaine's hand, and runs

outside the room, dragging Elaine behind him.

The two journalists react to the news.

       THE OTHER JOURNALIST

       That's him !

They start running after Mortimer.

CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE MARRIAGE BUREAU - INTERIOR DAY

Still dragging Elaine, Mortimer runs in the corridor.

       THE OTHER JOURNALIST

       (voice over)

       Mister Brewster !

Mortimer pushes Elaine into a telephone booth and enters behind

her. There is already a man in the booth who is using the phone.

With three people in the booth, Mortimer can hardly close the door

behind him.

The two journalists runs in the corridor.

       THE OTHER JOURNALIST

       Oh, Mister Brewster !

But they pass the booth without noticing that Mortimer is inside.

In the booth, the man, still holding the phone receiver, tries to

protest the intrusion.

       THE MAN ON THE PHONE

       Now, look...

Mortimer takes the receiver from him and speaks into it.

       MORTIMER

       Goodbye, dear.

He hangs up the receiver, and then pushes violently the man

outside the booth. The man looks very angry, but doesn't try to

come back in the booth.

In the booth, a very exciter Mortimer is talking to Elaine.

       MORTIMER

       Don't you understand ? How can I marry you ? Me, the symbol

       of bachelorhood. I've sneered at every love scene in every

       play. I've written four million words against marriage !

       Not only hooked, but to a minister's daughter, and not only

       a minister's daughter but a girl from Brooklyn. And look at

       the way you look ! What is that sort of contraption you've

       got there ?

He taps on a pin on the lapel of Elaine's jacket.

       ELAINE

       That's a pin I borrowed from your aunts. You know what

       they're saying, "Something borrowed..."

       MORTIMER

       Yeah, I know that "Something borrowed, something blue."

       Old, new. Rice and old shoes. Carry you over the threshold.

       Niagara Falls. All that silly tripe I made fun for years.

       Is this what I've come to ? I can't go through with it. I

       won't marry you. And that's that.

He takes his glasses off. Elaine whispers :

       ELAINE

       Yes, Mortimer.

       MORTIMER

       What do you mean, Yes, Mortimer ? Aren't you insulted ?

       Aren't you going to cry ? Aren't you going to make a

       scene ?

       ELAINE

       No, Mortimer.

       MORTIMER

       And don't No, Mortimer me, either ! Don't you see

       marriage is a superstition. It's old-fashioned. It's...

       a... a... Ohh !...

He kisses her very passionately.

He stops kissing her, and gets out of the booth, dragging her

behind him. They enter the marriage bureau.

MARRIAGE LICENSE BUREAU - INTERIOR DAY

They get back a the end of the line of people waiting to be

married.

The girl in front of Elaine winks to Elaine. Elaine winks back to

her.

A man in front of the girls turns toward Mortimer and smiles to

him, in a slightly idiotic way. Mortimer looks at him, a bit

surprised, and gives him a forced smile, showing his teeth.

BROOKLYN - RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT - EXTERIOR DAY

We see a street in Brooklyn, in front of nice house. Written on

the screen in large white letters :

                        And now, back to

                     one of Brooklyn's most

                      charming residential

                           districts--

BROOKLYN - CHURCHYARD - EXTERIOR DAY

A churchyard, with a close-up on a tombstone : Jacob John

Vendemeer died 1654. Written on the screen in large white

letters :

                      --From her in you're

                           on your own.

We see the gate of the churchyard, with a plate that says : This

cemetery was established in april 1654

Along this gate, two cops are doing their beat. The older one,

Sargent Brophy, is talking to the younger one, Officer Patrick

O'Hara.

       BROPHY

       O'Hara, don't be a jerk. You don't seem to realize. I'm

       turning over to you the nicest, the best beat in Brooklyn.

       Now look at that old church. And them old houses.

       O'HARA

       Did George Washington ever do any sleeping around here ?

       BROPHY

       Of course he did. Well, this whole neighborhood just stinks

       with atmosphere. And look at that old house there.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

Walking their beat, the two cops have come outside the Brewster

sisters residence.

       O'HARA

       Are the original owners still over there ?

       BROPHY

       Now, don't crack wise about the Brewster sisters. They're

       two of the dearest, sweetest, kindest old ladies that ever

       walked the earth. They're out of this world. They're

       like... they're like pressed rose leaves.

They have come near a police call box. Brophy takes a key out of

his pocket to open the box

       O'HARA

       Pressed rose leaves ?

In front of the house, there is a Room for Rent sign. While

Brophy picks up the phone in the call box, O'Hara looks at the

sign.

       O'HARA

       The old girls must be kind of hard up, huh ?

       BROPHY

       No, no. Their old man left them fixed for life. And don't

       you call them the girls, either.

Brophy starts talking in the receiver of the call box.

       BROPHY

       Brophy. Is Lieutenant around ?

       O'HARA

       Then, so why here do they rent a room for ?

       BROPHY

       They don't rent rooms. But you can bet if anybody came

       looking for a room, they wouldn't go away without a good

       meal and probably a couple of bucks in their pockets.

       That's just their way of digging up people to do good to.

We get a closer view of the front of the house. A large

rectangular stone, with Brewster engraved on it. A group of

children runs in front of the house.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

In the forefront of the room, Teddy Brewster is playing Mozart's

Turkish March on the harpsichord. He looks a bit like late

President Theodore Roosevelt. And he is dressed like the President

was dressed on the official pictures we've got of him... And, like

the President, he is wearing a pince-nez.

In another corner of the room, Abby Brewster is having tea with

Reverend Harper, Elaine's father. She looks like an old English

lady, a bit like Agatha Christie's Miss Marple.

       ABBY

       Reverend Harper, I do hope you don't disapprove of Mortimer

       just because he's a dramatic critic and takes your daughter

       to the theater every night.

       REVEREND HARPER

       It's not so much that I disapprove of his being a critic,

       but no man, no man with this published attitude on

       marriage...

Close-up on the book Reverend Harper just took on the table :

Marriage, a Fraud and a Failure, by Mortimer Brewster.

       REVEREND HARPER

       ...should take any man's daughter anyplace...

He sneezes.

       REVEREND HARPER

       ...at any time.

He sneezes again, louder this time. Teddy stops playing and there

is a puzzled look in his eyes.

       TEDDY

       I must be catching cold.

       ABBY

       (to Teddy)

       No, dear. It was Reverend Harper who sneezed.

       (to Reverend Harper)

       Bless you.

Teddy puts back in his pocket the handkerchief he had taken out

and starts playing again.

       ABBY

       We mustn't be angry with Mortimer. He's so very much in

       love with her. And Sister Martha and I are so happy about

       it. He used to come to see us only occasionally, and now,

       now he's in Brooklyn six nights a week.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

The two cops, Brophy and O'Hara, are mounting the steps to the

Brewster sisters house.

       BROPHY

       Remember now, watch your language.

       O'HARA

       Besides, you know I'm not a swearing man.

       BROPHY

       You'd be surprised what they'd consider swearing.

He rings the doorbell.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

At the sound of the doorbell, Teddy stops playing.

       ABBY

       Oh, will you excuse me ?

She gets up from her armchair.

       ABBY

       No, no, Teddy, dear. Thank you. I'll go.

She goes to the door and opens it.

       ABBY

       Oh, come right in, Mr. Brophy.

The two cops get in.

       BROPHY

       Miss Abby, we came for the toys.

       ABBY

       Oh yes.

O'Hara closes the door.

       BROPHY

       This is Officer O'Hara. He's taking over my beat.

       O'HARA

       How are you doing ?

       ABBY

       May I welcome you to our neighborhood, Mister O'Hara.

Teddy, with his teacup in hand, joins the group. He speaks with a

very serious expression on his face.

       TEDDY

       Gentlemen, what news have you brought me ?

Brophy salutes him and stands at attention.

       BROPHY

       Colonel, we have nothing to report.

Teddy gives an intrigued look to O'Hara, who doesn't seem to

understand. Brophy elbows him with the arm which is still

saluting.

       O'HARA

       Huh ?

He eventually understands what his Sargent is trying to tell him.

       O'HARA

       Oh no, absolutely nothing to report.

He salutes but with a less official attitude than his Sargent.

Teddy smiles.

       TEDDY

       Splendid ! Thank you, gentlemen.

       (very serious again)

       At ease.

Brophy puts his arm down. O'Hara looks at his Sargent with a

perplexed expression, and takes longer to put his arm down

       ABBY

       You know the Reverend Doctor Harper from the church next

       door ?

       BROPHY

       Hello, Reverend. This is Officer O'Hara, the new man on the

       beat.

Teddy looks at O'Hara with a puzzled expression.

       O'HARA

       How do you do, sir ? It's nice to meet you.

O'Hara looks ill at ease under Teddy's stare.

       ABBY

       The toys are on the chair up here, by the library door.

O'Hara moves toward the pile of toys. Teddy's eyes are following

him with the same puzzled expression. O'Hara feels less and less

at ease.

       ABBY

       Oh, Teddy, will you run upstairs and bring down your Army

       and Navy from Aunt Martha's room. They're all packed.

       REVEREND HARPER

       That's splendid work you men do, fixing up discarded toys

       for the kids at camp.

Teddy, who has started to mount the stairs to the upper level,

stops in his stride, pretends he is taking a sword out of a sheath

at his side, points this imaginary sword in front of him and

starts running up the stairs, yelling :

       TEDDY

       Charge !

When he arrives on the balcony, on which open the bedroom doors,

he rushes into his room and slams the door.

While Bophy and Reverend Harper remain unmoved, O'Hara, who is

standing by the grandfather's clock, jumps and looks at the clock,

which chimes once. The minute hand of the clock falls down to the

half-hour position. O'Hara is very disturbed and points his stick

to his Sargent, who seems to be totally unmoved by the event and

laughs with Reverend Harper and Abby.

       BROPHY

       It gives us something to do as we are sitting around the

       station. You get tired of playing cards.

Abby moves away from them to the grandfather's clock. She puts the

minute hand back into its original position. Brophy and Reverend

Harper joins her by the clock.

       BROPHY

       So these are the toys ?

O'Hara picks up the box in which the toys are stocked.

       ABBY

       How's Missis Brophy ?

       BROPHY

       Oh, she's better, thank you. But a little weak, still.

       ABBY

       Well, I'll better get some beef broth for you to take to

       her.

       BROPHY

       Oh, Miss Abby, please don't bother. You've done so much

       already.

       ABBY

       Oh, Stuff and nonsense ! I won't be a minute.

She moves away and exits into the kitchen.

       REVEREND HARPER

       Gentlemen, if I know what pure kindness and absolute

       generosity are, it's because I've known the Brewster

       sisters.

On the balcony, Teddy gets out of his room with a bugle, and

starts playing it very loudly. O'Hara jumps and drops the box with

the toys on the floor. Reverend Harper and Brophy seem to be less

moved by the event.

Brophy stands back and points his finger up to Teddy.

       BROPHY

       Oh, Teddy, you promised me you wouldn't do that anymore.

Teddy, still standing on the balcony, answers him leaning on the

balustrade.

       TEDDY

       But I have to call a Cabinet meeting to get the release of

       those supplies.

       BROPHY

       Now don't do that again. Do you hear me ?

Teddy goes back into his room, slamming the door behind him. The

grandfather's clock chimes once, and the minute hand falls back to

the half-hour position. O'Hara jumps and looks at the clock.

       BROPHY

       He used to do that in the middle of the night, and

       neighbors raised Cain with me. They're a little afraid of

       him anyway.

       O'HARA

       Look, Sarge, I promised you I wouldn't swear, but what the

       heck...

He stops in the middle of his sentence, gives a quick look to

Reverend Harper, and corrects himself.

       O'HARA

       ...What's going on here anyway ?

       REVEREND HARPER

       Oh, he's quite harmless.

       BROPHY

       He thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt. So what, there's a lot of

       worse guys he could think he was.

       O'HARA

       Huh ?

O'Hara gives a quick look toward the upper landing, and then nods.

       O'HARA

       That's right. I'll make a note of it. He's a very

       interesting character.

       BROPHY

       Isn't it a shame, Father, isn't it a shame, Reverend, that

       a nice family like this should be hatching a cuckoo ?

The front door opens and Martha Brewster comes in. Like her

sister, she looks like an old English lady. She is wearing a short

cape and a hat, and she carries a cylindrical can with a handle.

She closes the door.

       MARTHA

       Oh, well, now, isn't this nice !

She goes to Brophy and the Reverend.

       BROPHY

       Good afternoon, Miss Brewster.

       MARTHA

       How do you do, Mr Brophy ?

       REVEREND HARPER

       Good afternoon, Miss Brewster.

O'Hara has picked up the toys and he joins the group.

       MARTHA

       Reverend Harper, how do you do ?

       BROPHY

       Oh, Miss Martha, this is Officer O'Hara. He's taking over

       my duties.

       O'HARA

       How do you do, ma'am ?

       MARTHA

       I'm very glad to know you.

Abby comes out of the kitchen, carrying a cylindrical can, similar

to the one her sister is carrying

       O'HARA

       Thank you.

Abby joins the group.

       ABBY

       Oh, Martha, you're back.

She gives the can to Brophy. Meanwhile, Martha has taken her cape

off.

       ABBY

       Here's the broth for Missis Brophy. Be sure it's good and

       hot.

       BROPHY

       You bet I will, and thank you very much.

Teddy is getting down the stairs, carrying a box full of toys

under his arm. He stops a few steps from floor level

       TEDDY

       The Army and Navy are ready for action.

He resumes his walking down the stairs.

       BROPHY

       Oh, Colonel, this is grand. It'll make a lot of kids happy.

Brophy takes the box from Teddy. Teddy looks into the box O'Hara

is carrying, and takes a model warship out of the box.

       TEDDY

       What's this ? The Oregon ?

       MARTHA

       Oh, Teddy, dear, put it back.

She has taken her hat off.

       TEDDY

       But the Oregon goes to Australia.

       ABBY

       Now, Teddy...

Teddy tucks the model ship under his arm. O'Hara looks at him with

puzzled eyes.

       TEDDY

       No, it goes to Australia.

       BROPHY

       These are lovely. Thank you very much.

       ABBY

       Not at all.

Brophy moves toward the front door. O'Hara follows him, still

looking at Teddy. Teddy doesn't seem to like the way he looks at

him, and moves the toy ship away from him.

       BROPHY

       The children will go crazy.

He has reached the front door. Abby has moved near the door, ready

to open it for him.

       ABBY

       Oh, now, don't mention it.

O'Hara salutes Teddy.

       O'HARA

       Well... So long, Colonel.

Teddy looks at him and then looks at Brophy, who doesn't salute

him. O'Hara elbows his Sargent with the arm which is saluting.

       O'HARA

       Hey, Sarge.

       BROPHY

       Hey ?

Brophy looks at Teddy and understands the situation. He also

salutes Teddy.

       BROPHY

       Oh, yes.

Teddy salutes them.

       TEDDY

       Dismissed !

Brophy and O'Hara bring their arms down.

       BROPHY

       Well, goodbye and thank you.

       ABBY

       Good bye.

Abby opens the front door. The two cops start going out, Brophy

first.

       ABBY

       Careful of the step here now with the toys.

       BROPHY

       Good night.

O'Hara goes out, and then comes one step back and shows his face

behind the door. He winks to Teddy. Teddy raises his eyebrows.

       TEDDY

       Young man, let that be a lesson to you.

O'Hara chuckles, then makes a strange face, and goes out.

       ABBY

       Goodbye.

She closes the door, and goes back to her sister and Reverend

Harper.

       ABBY

       Well...

       REVEREND HARPER

       Well, I must be going.

Teddy, still carrying his model warship, starts mounting the

stairs, stops after a few steps, takes his imaginary sword out,

points it forward and runs upstairs, yelling :

       TEDDY

       Charge !

He reaches the balcony, turns toward the balustrade and yells.

       TEDDY

       Charge the blockhouse !

He goes into his room and slams the door behind him. We hear the

grandfather's clock chiming once.

Reverend Harper looks up at the balcony, then turns to the

Brewster sisters with puzzled eyes.

       REVEREND HARPER

       Blockhouse ?

       MARTHA

       Oh, the stairs are always San Juan Hill.

       REVEREND HARPER

       Oh, I...

But Reverend Harper doesn't finish his sentence and sneezes very

loudly. He takes his handkerchief out of his pocket to put it

under his nose.

       ABBY

       Bless you !

       REVEREND HARPER

       Have you ever tried to persuade him he wasn't Teddy

       Roosevelt ?

       ABBY

       Oh, no !

She goes to the grandfather's clock.

       MARTHA

       Oh, he's so happy being Teddy Roosevelt.

Abby moves the minute hand of the clock back in place.

       ABBY

       Oh, do you remember, Martha ?

She comes back to her sister and Reverend Harper.

       ABBY

       Once, a long time ago, we thought if he'd be George

       Washington, it might be a change for him, and we suggested

       it.

       MARTHA

       And do you know what happened ? He just stayed under his

       bed for days and wouldn't be anybody.

Reverend Harper laughs.

       REVEREND HARPER

       Well, if he's happy, and what's more important, you're

       happy...

He starts walking toward the front door, followed by the Brewster

sisters. He reaches the door and opens it.

       MARTHA

       Oh, our only worry for Teddy is after we are gone.

They all go out.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

The three of them are coming out of the house.

       REVEREND HARPER

       Yes, indeed. That is quite a problem.

       ABBY

       But Mortimer's made all the arrangements for Teddy to go to

       Happy Dale Sanitarium after we pass on.

       REVEREND HARPER

       Splendid idea ! A very pleasant place.

       MARTHA

       Yes...

Reverend Harper put his hat back on his head, and starts walking

toward his own house.

       ABBY

       Dear, sweet Reverend Harper.

The two sisters look at him. We see him cross the churchyard and

enter his house.

       ABBY

       You know, Martha, I really do believe he's beginning to see

       the light.

They start walking back to the door of their house.

       MARTHA

       I'm sure we needn't worry about him. He won't interfere

       with our plans for Mortimer and Elaine.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

The two sisters enter their house. Martha closes the door.

       MARTHA

       Oh, did you just have tea ?

       ABBY

       Yes. And dinner's going to be late, too.

       MARTHA

       Ohh ! Why ?

They both turn their heads toward the stairs, because they just

heard Teddy's door slamming.

       ABBY

       Teddy ?...

She goes to the stairs, followed by Martha. Teddy is coming down.

       ABBY

       Oh, Teddy, good news for you. You're going to Panama and

       dig another lock for the canal.

She points her finger toward the cellar door. Martha seems

delighted by the news.

       TEDDY

       Delighted !

He rubs his hands

       TEDDY

       That's bully ! Just bully ! I shall prepare at once for the

       journey.

He starts mounting the stairs, stops and goes back a few steps

down, takes his imaginary sword out, points it forward, and runs

upstairs, yelling :

       TEDDY

       Charge !

Before Teddy slams his door, Abby put her hand on the face of the

clock to prevent the minute hand falling down.

       MARTHA

       Abby ! While I was out ?

       ABBY

       Yes, dear. I just couldn't wait for you. I didn't know when

       you'd be back, and Reverend Harper was coming.

       MARTHA

       But all by yourself.

       ABBY

       Oh, I got along fine.

       MARTHA

       I'll run right downstairs and see.

She goes to the cellar door.

       ABBY

       No, no, dear. There wasn't time. And I was all alone.

Martha looks around in the room, then looks at her sister with

questioning eyes.

       MARTHA

       Well ?

       ABBY

       Martha, just look in the window-seat.

She points to the large chest-bench under the window. Martha seems

delighted and both sisters go to the window-seat. They bend down

to raise the lid of the seat, when someone taps on the window

above the seat. The two sisters stand up and move the curtains

revealing Elaine's face.

       ABBY

       Oh ! It's Elaine !

Elaine raises the window and kisses the two sisters.

       ELAINE

       You, darlings.

She winks at them, and then runs away.

       MARTHA

       But, Elaine !

       ABBY

       What did she mean ? You don't suppose they've gone and...

Martha puts her hand over her mouth.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

A taxi cab has stopped in front of the Brewster sisters house. The

driver is half inside the back of his car, apparently looking for

something. Mortimer is already out of the cab. He is whistling. He

raises his hand and yells :

       MORTIMER

       Elaine !

Elaine is crossing the churchyard to go to her father's house. She

stops and turns around to look at Mortimer.

On one of the tombstones is engraved the name Amanda Brewster

and the dates : 1813-1863.

The Brewster sisters, who were bending out of their window to get

a better view of the scene, are coming back in, looking extremely

happy.

The cab driver gives his coat to Mortimer.

       CAB DRIVER

       Listen, buddy. This old cab has seen osculation but...

He whistles and goes back inside the back of the car to look for

other missing items.

       MORTIMER

       You ain't seen anything yet. You've got to drive us to the

       station.

The driver comes out of the cab, holding a hat.

       CAB DRIVER

       You'd better take her hat.

       MORTIMER

       Oh thanks.

The driver goes back inside the car.

       CAB DRIVER

       Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a... And her brooch.

He gives Mortimer the brooch.

       MORTIMER

       If you find her hairpins, you can keep them. Hold on to

       that.

He gives his coat back to the driver and runs away.

       CAB DRIVER

       Yeah !

Mortimer runs across the churchyard to meet Elaine.

We see the two Brewster sisters peeking behind the curtains of

their window.

       MARTHA

       There they are.

Mortimer gives Elaine her hat. She doesn't take it.

       MORTIMER

       Here's your hat.

       ELAINE

       Just throw it. I don't like that look in your eyes.

       MORTIMER

       What ? What's the matter ?

       ELAINE

       Father preached in sermon about it only last Sunday.

       MORTIMER

       He did ? He did ? What did he say ? What did he say ?

Elaine is trying to avoid Mortimer by going around a tree.

       ELAINE

       He was against it.

       MORTIMER

       Ah ! But that was only Sunday.

He chases her around the tree. They laugh. Mortimer starts

clowning.

       MORTIMER

       Please ! For heaven's sake !

       ELAINE

       But, Mortimer, right out here in the open with everyone

       looking ?

       MORTIMER

       Yeah ! Right out here in the open with everyone looking.

       Let everyone in Brooklyn over 16 look.

He starts chasing her again.

Behind their curtain, the two sisters are still peeking. They

laugh and then slightly move the curtains open a few inches to

have a better look.

Back to the tree. The couple is hidden by the tree. They separate

and move a little away from each other, each one of them appearing

on either side the tree.

Elaine drags Mortimer by the hand from behind the tree.

       ELAINE

       But, Mortimer, you're going to love me for my mind, too ?

       MORTIMER

       One thing at a time.

She starts running away from him.

       ELAINE

       Oh ! There's that look again !

Mortimer comes slowly from behind the tree, clowning.

       MORTIMER

       There's that look again, Mortimer ! You better get used

       to it.

He becomes more serious and come closer to her.

       MORTIMER

       Look like you're going to see it often. It goes just before

       this.

He kisses her very passionately.

       MORTIMER

       You know what we're doing, darling ? We're wasting time.

       Look, I'll go tell my aunts and you tell your old... No,

       you'd better not tell your father just yet. You'll run that

       cold of his into a pneumonia.

       ELAINE

       Oh, I can handle Father. He's a dear.

       MORTIMER

       Look, why don't we wire him from Niagara Falls ?

       ELAINE

       Niagara Falls ?

Mortimer nods.

       ELAINE

       Then that's why you stopped at your office.

       MORTIMER

       Yes, certainly ! We're going to go the whole hog. Niagara

       Falls ! Everybody ought to go to Niagara Falls. You

       should've seen my secretary's face when I made the

       reservation. We've got a drawing-room on the train,

       the bridal suite in the hotel, and tomorrow morning

       we go over the falls in a barrel.

Elaine kisses Mortimer very passionately.

       MORTIMER

       Go on, darling, hurry and pack.

       ELAINE

       I don't have to. I started packing the day after I met you.

She starts moving away. He holds her back.

       MORTIMER

       There, you see ! You see ? That's what I mean. That's what

       I hate about women.

Mortimer kisses her.

Back to the cab driver who is pacing in front of his car. He rubs

his chin.

       CAB DRIVER

       I wonder what Mary's doing now ?

Mortimer and Elaine are still kissing. Mortimer lets go of Elaine.

He puts her hat on her head.

       MORTIMER

       Go on, darling, the train leaves in an hour, and hurry.

       ELAINE

       It'll be a few minutes before I'm ready. Father may want to

       pray over me a little.

She moves away.

       MORTIMER

       Whistle when you're ready. Oh, Elaine...

She turns around.

       ELAINE

       Yeah.

       MORTIMER

       When you whistle, open the front door fast. If you see a

       tall, dark streak of light, it's me.

He starts running toward his aunts' house. Elaine runs to her

father's house.

She stops at the door of her house and starts whistling.

Mortimer, who had also reached his door, stops and turns around.

       MORTIMER

       What ? Now ?

He starts running toward her, but she stops him.

       ELAINE

       No, not now !

She opens her door.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

The two sisters are eagerly waiting for Mortimer. Martha whispers.

       MARTHA

       Look surprised when he tells us.

Abby laughs. They hear a door slamming in the next room.

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha !

Mortimer rushes into the room and throws his hat on a chair.

       MORTIMER

       Hold on to your bustles. We're married. Elaine and I are

       married.

The two sisters hug and kiss Mortimer.

       ABBY

       Oh, darling, how wonderful ! Oh, Martha, isn't it

       wonderful ? They're married!

       MORTIMER

       Yeah ! Don't pretend to be so surprised either, you two old

       frauds. Can I use the telephone, darling ?

       ABBY

       Yes, of course.

Mortimer goes to the telephone, followed by his two aunts.

       ABBY

       Isn't it too, too wonderful ?

Mortimer sits at the small desk on which the telephone is, and

whistles while dialing.

       MARTHA

       And to think that it happened right here in this room !

She dabs her nose with her handkerchief.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, now, here, here, now ! Hello ?... Hello ? Benson's

       Florists ? This is Mortimer Brewster. Did you send those

       roses to Missis Brewster's apartment ?... You did ? Good.

       Now, send four dozen more to drawing room A, Canadian

       Limited, Grand Central Station. Yes... And hurry then. And

       throw in a flock of orange blossoms.

He puts the telephone receiver back on his hook, and he turns on

his chair to face his aunts, his arms resting on the back of the

chair.

       ABBY

       But before you go, we can have our celebration. I'll open a

       bottle of wine and we'll sing. And we'll invite a few of

       the neighbors in.

       MARTHA

       And, of course, a wedding cake.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, darling, you won't have time to bake a cake. We're

       going to Niagara Falls. I've got a taxi waiting.

       ABBY

       Oh, it's all ready. It's been ready since..

       MORTIMER

       Yeah, I bet it's been ready since the first day I met her,

       huh ?

He stands up.

       MORTIMER

       What is it ? Did everybody in Brooklyn know I was getting

       married, except me ?

       MARTHA

       Oh, we knew you'd find out about it in time.

Mortimer laughs and hugs his aunts.

       MORTIMER

       Come here. I've got the two nicest aunts in the world. Of

       course, you've got the nicest nephew in the world, too.

Martha moves away to the kitchen.

       MARTHA

       Well, I'll run along and get everything ready.

       ABBY

       Oh, dear. I do hope the Reverend isn't too angry. You know

       how your books upset him.

       MORTIMER

       Well, I'm going to burn all my books. And I'll let the

       Reverend Harper light the first match. Oh, by the way, did

       I leave some notes here for my new book ?

       ABBY

       You mean Mind Over Matrimony ?

       MORTIMER

       Yes ! Shhh ! Where are they ?

       ABBY

       I hid them someplace...

Abby turns to go searching, and Mortimer pats her behind.

       MORTIMER

       Come on, come on. Let's go.

Abby turns back to him.

       ABBY

       Now you behave.

She goes away on her search.

       MORTIMER

       Let's find them before Elaine sees them.

Teddy comes out of his room on the balcony. He is dressed in full

colonial costume, complete with pith helmet. He is carrying a

shovel and his bugle is stuck in his belt. He walks rapidly down

the stairs.

He stops a few steps from the ground floor, when he spots

Mortimer. He seems very happy to see him.

       TEDDY

       Hello, Mortimer !

They shake hands.

       MORTIMER

       How are you, Mister President ?

       TEDDY

       Bully, thank you. Just bully. What news have you brought

       me ?

Teddy takes off his pince-nez.

       MORTIMER

       Just this, Mister President. The country's squarely behind

       you.

       TEDDY

       Yes, I know. Isn't it wonderful ?

He puts his pince-nez back on his nose, and shakes hands again

with Mortimer.

       TEDDY

       Well, goodbye. I'm off to Panama.

Teddy walks to the cellar door. Mortimer bends slightly.

       MORTIMER

       Goodbye, Mister President.

Before he opens the door, Teddy turns to Mortimer.

       TEDDY

       A new lock for the canal, you know.

He opens the door, and starts walking down the steps to the

cellar. Before the door closes back, we can hear him singing :

       TEDDY

       Oh, tell the news to Mother.

Abby is still looking for Mortimer's note, and, in a drawer, she

finds a piece of paper that seems to annoy her.

       ABBY

       Oh, dear.

       MORTIMER

       Did you find those notes ?

Mortimer senses there is something wrong in his aunt's voice, and

walks to her.

       MORTIMER

       What's the matter ?

She holds the paper for Mortimer to take it.

       ABBY

       There's a baby picture of your brother Jonathan.

Mortimer takes the picture and looks at it.

INSERT - Close-up of the picture. It shows a very ugly child with

a very strange face.

       MORTIMER

       You ought to put that in the fire with my books. My, what a

       face !

He gives the picture back to Abby.

       MORTIMER

       I remember now. He used to scare grownups with it.

Mortimer walks away from his aunt.

       ABBY

       Just the thought of Jonathan frightens me. Do you remember

       how he used to cut worms in two with his teeth ?

Mortimer is searching on the small telephone desk.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, Jonathan ? Oh, he's probably in prison or hanged or

       something by now.

He walks across the room and starts searching on the table.

       MORTIMER

       I saw a play, which had a character in it. Reminded me of

       Jonathan.

       ABBY

       No ? Really?

While talking, they both keep on searching everywhere in the room.

       MORTIMER

       Yeah. Oh, a honey of a lunatic. One of those whodunits

       called Murder Will Out.

       ABBY

       Oh, dear !

Abby goes into the kitchen.

       MORTIMER

       Yeah, what a play. When the curtain goes up, the first

       thing you see is a dead body.

While talking, he keeps on searching and opens the lid of the

window-seat. He gives its insides a quick look and closes it back,

and then moves away.

       MORTIMER

       The next thing...

He stops in his tracks and looks back at the window-seat. He jumps

back to it, opens the lid and closes it very quickly. He then sits

on the seat with a frightened look on his face. Slowly, he kneels

down on the floor, and opens the lid again, but very slowly. He

talks to whatever, or whomever, is in the seat.

       MORTIMER

       Hey, mister.

He remains a few seconds seated of the seat, with a very puzzled

face.

We hear Elaine whistling. Mortimer tries to whistle back, but no

sound comes from his mouth. He tries again, but with no more

success. He seems in shock.

He looks at the kitchen, then at the seat. There is horror on his

face.

His two aunts come from the kitchen, singing and carrying things

for the celebration.

Mortimer shows a forced smile.

The two sisters puts things on the table, then they come to

Mortimer, who is still seated on the window-seat. Abby is carrying

a big bowl of rice, and the two girls start throwing rice on him.

       ABBY

       Happy bridegroom !

       MARTHA

       Congratulations, darling !

       MORTIMER

       Never mind that now. I know.

Mortimer takes the bowl from Abby's hands and put it on a small

table. He remains seated while his aunts are standing in front of

him.

       MORTIMER

       Now, listen, darlings. Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha, you know how

       we've always planned to send Teddy to that Sanitarium,

       Happy Dale ?

       ABBY

       Oh, yes, dear. That's after we're gone.

They move away to start setting the table.

       ABBY

       Yes, we talked with Reverend Harper about it.

       MORTIMER

       No, no. Teddy's got to go to Happy Dale now. At once ! Now,

       he's down in the cellar. Get him up here right away.

       MARTHA

       But, there's no such hurry as yet, you know.

       ABBY

       No... When Teddy's working on the canal, you can't get his

       mind on anything else.

Mortimer stands up and comes to the table where his aunts are

working.

       MORTIMER

       Well, look, darlings. Look, I'm frightfully sorry, but I've

       got an awful shock for you.

He takes Abby's hands in his.

       MORTIMER

       Teddy's killed a man, darlings !

Martha laughs.

       MARTHA

       Nonsense !

       MORTIMER

       (he yells)

       But there's a body in the window-seat !

       ABBY

       Yes, dear. We know.

Mortimer looks even more shocked than before. His two aunts keep

on setting the table as if nothing had happened.

       MORTIMER

       You know ?

       MARTHA

       Of course.

       ABBY

       Yes, but it has nothing to do with Teddy.

Mortimer wants to speak, but Abby stops him.

       ABBY

       Now, Mortimer. You just forget about it. Forget you ever

       saw the gentleman.

       MORTIMER

       Forget ?

       ABBY

       We never dreamed you'd peek.

       MORTIMER

       What the... Who is he ?

       ABBY

       He's a Mister Hoskins. Adam Hoskins. That's really all I

       know about him, except that he's a Methodist.

       MARTHA

       Oh ! He's a Methodist ? Isn't that nice.

       MORTIMER

       That's all you know ? But what's he doing here ? What

       happened to him ?

Mortimer is more and more shocked and his aunts, very calmly, keep

on putting plates and silverware on the table.

       MARTHA

       He died.

       MORTIMER

       Look, Aunt Martha, men just don't get into window-seats and

       die.

       ABBY

       No, dear. He died first.

Mortimer takes his aunts' hands to stop them from setting the

table.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, well, now wait ! Stop all this.

He takes Abby's hands in his.

       MORTIMER

       Now look, darlings, how did he die ?

       ABBY

       Oh, Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive. The gentleman died

       because he drank some wine with poison in it.

       MORTIMER

       But, how did the poison get in the wine ?

       MARTHA

       Well we put it in wine because it's less noticeable.

       When it's in tea, it has a distinct odor.

       MORTIMER

       You mean you...

       (yelling)

       You put it in the wine ?

       ABBY

       Yes. And I put Mister Hoskins in the window-seat, because

       Reverend Harper was coming.

Mortimer seems ready to faint.

       MORTIMER

       Ohh ! Look at me, darling.

He takes again Abby's hands in his.

       MORTIMER

       You mean, you mean you knew what you'd done and you didn't

       want the Reverend Harper to see the body ?

       ABBY

       Well, not at tea. That wouldn't have been very nice.

Abby goes back table-setting and Mortimer holds himself on the

edge of the table.

       MORTIMER

       Ohh ! It's first-degree.

       ABBY

       Now, Mortimer, you know all about it and just forget about

       it. I do think that Martha and I have the right to our own

       little secrets.

Martha walks to the kitchen door, but she stops and turns around.

       MARTHA

       Oh, Abby, while I was out I dropped in on Missis Schultz.

       She's much better. But she wants us to take Junior to the

       movies again.

       ABBY

       Well, we must do that, tomorrow or next day.

       MARTHA

       Yes, but this time we'll go where we want to go. Junior's

       not going to drag me into another one of those scary

       pictures.

The two sisters enter the kitchen.

       ABBY

       No, they ought not to be allowed to make those pictures

       just to frighten people.

Mortimer remains alone in the room. He has the face of someone who

thinks he is having a nightmare and hopes to wake up soon.

He goes to the telephone desk, picks up the phone and dials 0.

       MORTIMER

       Operator ?... Can you hear my voice ?... You can ?...

       Are you sure ?...

He puts the phone down.

       MORTIMER

       Then I must be here.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

Elaine is appearing of her room in her father's house. She has got

her purse and her gloves. She plays with a large artificial

flower. She whistles.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Mortimer, half-seated on the telephone desk, comes out of his

dream, and goes to the window. By signs only, he tries to explain

to Elaine that he's got a problem with the window-seat. We don't

see her, but we imagine she doesn't understand, because Mortimer

rushes to the kitchen.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

Mortimer rushes into the kitchen.

       MORTIMER

       Aunt Abby ! Aunt Martha !

He stops abruptly. A group of costumed and masked children are

gathered behind the window. Martha is distributing watermelons,

pumpkins and pies to them. The children are saying

incomprehensible words of thanking.

Martha closes the window on them, and switches on the lights.

       ABBY

       Oh, the dears. Isn't Halloween a wonderful time for them ?

       MARTHA

       Yes, it is. They have so much fun.

They both go back to their cooking work in the kitchen. Martha is

preparing some kind of desert in a bowl.

       MARTHA

       Now, Mortimer, don't be so impatient. We'll let you lick

       the bowl out.

       MORTIMER

       Lick the bowl ? I don't want to lick the bowl. I want to

       know what we're going to do !

       MARTHA

       Well, we're going to celebrate, dear.

       MORTIMER

       Celebrate ? There's a body in the window-seat !

       ABBY

       Yes, dear. Mister Hoskins.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, I know what his name is. I just want to know what we're

       going to do. We can't turn you over to the police.

Mortimer paces the kitchen, while his aunts are busy cooking.

       ABBY

       Yes. You just should get stop worrying about it.

       MARTHA

       We told you to forget the whole thing.

       MORTIMER

       (yelling)

       Forget ? Look, my dear aunt Martha, can't I make you

       realize that something has to be done ?

Abby leaves the stove where she was working and comes to the

table.

       ABBY

       Now, Mortimer, you behave. You're too old to be flying off

       the handle like this.

       MORTIMER

       But, but Mister Hodgekiss...

       ABBY

       Hoskins, dear.

       MORTIMER

       But whatever his name is, you can't leave him in there.

       MARTHA

       We don't intend to, dear.

       ABBY

       No, Teddy's down in the cellar now, digging the lock.

Mortimer looks very shocked.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, you mean you're going to bury Mister Hodgekiss in the

       cellar ?

       MARTHA

       Oh, yes, dear. That's what we did with the others.

       MORTIMER

       Look, here, Aunt Martha. You can't...

He comes close to the table where Martha is working. And all of a

sudden, he seems to realize what she just said.

       MORTIMER

       Others ?

       MARTHA

       The other gentlemen.

       MORTIMER

       Oh ! When you say others, do you mean others ? More

       than one others ?

Martha laughs.

       MARTHA

       Oh, yes, dear. Let me see now. This is eleven, isn't it,

       Abby ?

       ABBY

       Oh no, dear. This makes twelve.

       MARTHA

       Abby, dear, I think you're wrong. This one is only eleven.

       ABBY

       No, dear, because I remember when Mister Hoskins first came

       in, it occurred to me that he'd make just an even dozen.

Mortimer seems completely dejected and he sits down, not even

listening to his aunts anymore.

       MARTHA

       But, look, Abby dear, I really don't think you should count

       the first one.

       ABBY

       Oh, I was counting the first one, and that makes it twelve.

       MARTHA

       It does ?

Abby, who is sucking her finger, nods to answer.

       MARTHA

       Well, she's probably right. Abby usually is. I get them

       mixed up sometimes.

       MORTIMER

       Makes it twelve. Well...

The telephone rings. Mortimer puts his hand to his ear.

       MORTIMER

       Hello ?

He suddenly realizes that he doesn't have a telephone in his hand.

       MORTIMER

       Oh !

He rushes out of the kitchen.

       ABBY

       Well, whatever is the matter with Mortimer today ?

       MARTHA

       Why, Abby, what do you think happened to him ?

They walk out of the kitchen.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Mortimer sits at the telephone desk and picks up the phone.

       MORTIMER

       Hello ?

We hear some whistling, coming from the telephone. Mortimer takes

the receiver a bit away from his ear, surprised. Then he takes it

back.

       MORTIMER

       Not now. Not now. For heaven's sake, keep your shirt on !

He slams the phone down on his hook. Then he realizes he has been

rude, and picks it up again.

       MORTIMER

       Oh... Oh, Elaine, I didn't mean...

He realizes there is no one on the phone, and puts it back down.

       MORTIMER

       Now, let's see. Where were we ? Twelve.

       (he yells)

       Twelve !

He jumps from his chair and rushes toward the kitchen. But, when

he sees his two aunts setting the table, he stops and goes to

them.

       MARTHA

       Yes, dear. Abby thinks we should count the first one.

       MORTIMER

       Never mind about that. Just sit down.

Martha sits down.

       MORTIMER

       Now, tell me, who was the first one ?

       ABBY

       Mister Midgely. He was a Baptist.

       MARTHA

       He was such a lonely, old gentleman, Mister Midgely was.

       ABBY

       All his kith and kin were dead.

       MARTHA

       We felt so sorry for him.

       ABBY

       And then, when his heart attack came, and he sat there dead

       in that chair, looking so peaceful. Remember, Martha ? We

       made up our minds, then and there, that if we could help

       other lonely, old men to find that same peace, we would.

       MORTIMER

       Why, you poor... You mean, he dropped dead right in this

       chair ?

Mortimer realizes it's the chair he's sitting on, and stands up

very quickly.

       ABBY

       And then, you see, Teddy came up from digging in Panama,

       and he thought Mister Midgely was a yellow-fever victim.

       And that meant he had to be buried immediately.

       MORTIMER

       So ?

       MARTHA

       So, we all took him down to Panama, and put him in the lock

       and gave him a decent Christian burial. There, now you

       see ?

       (she stands up)

       That's why we told you not to bother about it, because we

       know exactly what's to be done.

Mortimer is sitting on the table, and seems not to know what he

must do next. But he suddenly stands up.

       MORTIMER

       Wait a minute !

He rushes to his aunts.

       MORTIMER

       Come here, darlings. What about the others ? All twelve of

       them didn't walk in here and drop dead.

       ABBY

       Oh, no, dear. Of course not !

       MORTIMER

       Well, so, so...

Abby whispers something in Martha's ear. Martha looks at Mortimer,

smiles, and whispers back in her sister's ear.

       MARTHA

       Mortimer.

       MORTIMER

       Wh... what?

       MARTHA

       Do you remember those jars of poison that were on the

       shelves in Grandfather's laboratory all these years ?

       ABBY

       You know your Aunt Martha's knack for mixing things.

       You've eaten enough of her piccalilli.

       MARTHA

       Well, dear, for a gallon of elderberry wine, I take one

       teaspoonful of arsenic, then add half a teaspoonful of

       strychnine. And then, just a pinch of cyanide.

       MORTIMER

       Mmmm ! Should have quite a kick.

       ABBY

       Yes, as a matter of fact, one of our gentlemen found time

       to say : How delicious !

       MORTIMER

       He did ? Well, wasn't that nice of him ?

       MARTHA

       Abby, we mustn't be standing here gossiping all night.

       Well, we must get that cake frosted.

She moves toward the kitchen, followed by Abby.

       MORTIMER

       Oh no, darling, don't worry about the cake. I couldn't eat

       a thing.

       ABBY

       Oh, you newlyweds! A sip of wine will give you an appetite.

       MORTIMER

       That'd be nice, darling, a sip of... A sip of wine !

He stands up.

       MORTIMER

       Wine !

He wants to move away, but his foot get entangled in the back of a

chair, and he almost falls down.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY

Elaine appears at the window of her room. She is arranging the

artificial flower on the lapel of her jacket. She moves away from

the window.

The cab driver is still pacing on the sidewalk near his car.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Mortimer closes the drapes between the sitting-room and the next

room. He then goes to the cellar door and opens the door ajar. A

cat meows and comes out through the opening. We hear Teddy singing

down in the cellar.

       MORTIMER

       I'm beginning to think the cat's in on this.

He listens to the singing coming from the cellar.

       MORTIMER

       He's wonderful. Happy as a lark. Singing away, digging

       locks.

He closes the cellar door.

       MORTIMER

       Got him working on a yellow-fever victim. Oh, I can see the

       headlines now : Murder Incorporator Rides Again right

       across the front page. Let me see... Teddy ! Of course.

       Everybody knows he's crazy. Let me see. Who can I call up ?

       Dewey, La Guardia, Winchell ? No, Winchell's no good. Old

       Judge Cullman !

He starts moving across the room, putting his hand in the inside

breast pocket of his jacket.

       MORTIMER

       I wonder if I got his number.

He gets a couple of tickets out of his pocket. He sits at the

small telephone desk.

       MORTIMER

       What am I doing with tickets ?

He throws the tickets on the desk. He picks up the phone, and

starts dialing.

       MORTIMER

       Information... Hello ? Information ?... Get me the number

       of Judge Cullman on North Shore Road, Brooklyn. Yeah, would

       you call me back ?

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The night has come. Elaine is walking very rapidly on the

sidewalk. She passes near the taxi. The driver opens the door for

her, but she keeps on walking.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer is standing by the window-seat. All the drapes are

closed. He bends down.

       MORTIMER

       How it would be marvelous if he wasn't there.

He slowly opens the lid of the seat. When the lid is a few inches

open, he peeks inside.

       ELAINE

       (voice over)

       Hey, you !

When he hears Elaine's voice, Mortimer slams the lid down and sit

on the seat.

       ELAINE

       Thought you were tall, dark streak of light.

She is standing by the half-open door, and she makes the gestures

Mortimer made when he had told her the same sentence, earlier in

the churchyard.

       MORTIMER

       What are you doing here?

       ELAINE

       What am I doing here ? Didn't you hear me whistle ?

       MORTIMER

       Whistle ? Oh, yes, yes. I heard you whistle. But...

He stands up and comes to her in the middle of the room. He gives

her a quick kiss.

       ELAINE

       Hey, how do I look ?

She pivots to show him the way she is dressed.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, you look fine, you look fine. Now, run on home. I'll

       call you up tomorrow.

       ELAINE

       Tomorrow ?

He pushes her toward the door.

       MORTIMER

       Yeah, you know I always call you up every day or two.

She laughs.

       ELAINE

       Oh ! you and your gags ! Where's your hat ? Come on. The

       bags are in the taxi.

       MORTIMER

       Huh ? Taxi ? Huh, huh, huh ?

She is pulling him toward the door.

       ELAINE

       Yeah, come on !

       MORTIMER

       Oh, Elaine, I'm so sorry. But something's happened.

       ELAINE

       What'd you do, lose your nerve ? Hey, where's that look

       I was going to see so often ?

She takes his head to bring her mouth close to his ear, and then

she starts whistling. He moves away and rubs his ear.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, stop ! Don't whistle in my ear, please.

       ELAINE

       Mortimer, what is wrong ? Look at your hair.

He bends down for her to see his hair better.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, my God, what color is it ? Quick ! Has it turned ?

       ELAINE

       Oh, darling, what's the matter ? What happened ?

She starts stroking his face. He bends down on her shoulder.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, Elaine, if I could only tell you, Elaine. You smell so

       nice.

The phone rings. Mortimer jumps up

       MORTIMER

       Oh ! Oh !

He pushes her out through the open door.

       MORTIMER

       You better go home !

       ELAINE

       But, darling, we were married today.

       MORTIMER

       All right, go home, go to bed, get some rest !

       ELAINE

       Rest ?

He slams the door on her, and rushes to the telephone. He sits

down at the desk and picks up the phone.

       MORTIMER

       Who ? Who ? Judge Cullman ?

The front door opens, and Elaine comes back inside the house.

       MORTIMER

       This is Mortimer Brewster. Look, Judge, I'll tell you why I

       called you. It's about Teddy.

Elaine crosses the room and sits on the window-seat.

       MORTIMER

       I've got to come over and see you right away. Oh, I'm

       afraid it won't wait until tomorrow, Judge. Yeah, you see,

       it's very, very important. We've got to do something about

       it immediately. But it's practically a matter of life

       and...

Mortimer turns his head and sees Elaine sitting on the window-

seat. He drops the phone on the desk, and yells :

       MORTIMER

       Elaine !

Elaine, frightened, jumps up from the seat. Mortimer rushes to

her.

       MORTIMER

       Will you get out of here ?

       ELAINE

       Mortimer, what in the world is going on around here ? I

       don't even know where I stand !

       MORTIMER

       Anywhere, but don't stand there !

He moves her away from the window-seat.

       ELAINE

       But, darling, Niagara Falls !

       MORTIMER

       If it does, we'll let it !

       ELAINE

       Now, wait a minute ! Listen. You can't marry me one minute

       and then throw me out the house the next !

       MORTIMER

       Oh, darling, I'm not throwing you out of the house !

He lifts her and actually throws her out of the house

       MORTIMER

       Will you get out of here ?

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Elaine bumps into an old man, Mr. Gibbs, standing just outside the

entrance of the house. He is holding a newspaper in his hand.

She comes back to the door, but Mortimer slams it in her face.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer locks the door and goes back to the phone

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Elaine is knocking desperately on the door. Gibbs is still behind

her.

       ELAINE

       Mortimer !

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer is back sitting at the desk and talking into the phone.

In the background, we hear Elaine's pounding on the door.

       MORTIMER

       I'm sorry, Judge. But... a thing happened. But, Judge,

       about Teddy, you see...

       ELAINE

       (voice over)

       Mortimer !

       MORTIMER

       Hold it. You see, Judge, it's his bugle blowing. Yes, the

       neighbors have been complaining, and the police are all set

       to throw him into a state institution.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Elaine seems quite angry.

       ELAINE

       How do you like that ?

Gibbs shows his newspaper to Elaine

       GIBBS

       I read an ad here about a room to rent.

       ELAINE

       Oh ! Shut up !

She walks away, leaving Gibbs at the door. She walks quickly by

the taxi. The driver opens the door for her, but she walks on with

quick steps.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer is still on the phone.

       MORTIMER

       Well, I thought that if you sign the papers, I can get

       Teddy to commit himself, and get him in Happy Dale... Yes,

       it's a wonderful place, Judge... You will ?... Fine ! I'll

       be over right as soon as I've made another call.

The front door bell rings.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Gibbs is standing by the door, ringing the bell.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Abby comes in the room from the kitchen. Mortimer is still on the

phone.

       ABBY

       Doorbell's ringing, dear.

She crosses the room to the front door. She opens the door,

revealing Gibbs.

       ABBY

       Oh, how do you do ? Come in.

The kitchen door has remained open, and we see Martha still

working on her cooking.

       GIBBS

       (voice over)

       I understand you've got a room to rent.

Hearing that, Martha drops her cooking and comes into the room.

       ABBY

       Yes... Do step in.

Abby opens the door wide for him to get in.

       GIBBS

       Well, are you the lady of the house ?

       ABBY

       Yes, I'm Miss Brewster.

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       Yeah, operator ? Give me long distance, please.

Martha has joined her sister.

       ABBY

       And this is my sister. Another Miss Brewster.

Gibbs takes off his hat.

       GIBBS

       My name's Gibbs.

Quick shot on Mortimer, still on the phone. He gives a quick look

toward his aunts, but doesn't seem interested.

       ABBY

       Well, do sit down. I'm sorry, but we're just setting the

       table for dinner.

She moves an armchair on the other side of the table.

       ABBY

       Now, this would be a nice comfortable chair.

Back to Mortimer.

       MORTIMER

       Oh. Hello, long distance ? I want the Happy Dale

       Sanitarium, Happy Dale, New York.

Back to Gibbs and the sisters.

       ABBY

       Is Brooklyn your home ?

       GIBBS

       I haven't got a home. I live in a hotel. Don't like it.

       MARTHA

       A... are your family Brooklyn people ?

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       Hello ? Hap...

       GIBBS

       Haven't got any family.

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       Well, operator...

       ABBY

       All alone in the world ?

       GIBBS

       Yeah.

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       No, no...

Abby looks at her sister with a knowing smile.

       ABBY

       Well, Martha....

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       No, Happy Dale... Yes.

       ABBY

       Well, you've come to just the right house. You sit down.

She helps him sit down in the armchair, while Martha is bringing a

carafe of wine and a glass.

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       Dale. D like in dig, you know, when you dig a lock.

       That's right. A like in arsenic. Got that ?

Short close-up on the carafe of wine, now on the table.

       GIBBS

       Is there always this much noise ?

       MARTHA

       Oh ! He doesn't live with us.

Mortimer is standing, with the telephone set in one hand, and the

receiver on his ear in the other hand. He whispers.

       MORTIMER

       I can see the headlines now. Oh, please.

       (back to normal voice)

       Hello ?

Back to the table.

       GIBBS

       I'd really like to see the room. Well, I don't think I'll

       like it.

He stands up and takes his hat, which he had put on the table.

       ABBY

       The room's upstairs.

Abby is seated at the table, with Martha standing behind her. She

takes the carafe.

       ABBY

       Won't you try a glass of our wine before we start up ?

       GIBBS

       Never touch it.

       MARTHA

       Well, we make this ourselves. It's elderberry wine.

       GIBBS

       Elderberry ?

He puts his hat back on the table and sits down.

       GIBBS

       I haven't tasted elderberry wine since I was a boy.

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       Oh...

       GIBBS

       Thank you.

Abby starts pouring the wine in the glass.

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       Operator ! Well, I don't want the Happy Dale Laundry !

       I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium ! Sanitarium !

       Sanitarium ! Sanitarium ! Yes, like a broken record !

Gibbs takes the glass from Abby.

       GIBBS

       Have your own elderberry bushes ?

       MARTHA

       No, but the cemetery's full of them.

Gibbs raises his glass.

       GIBBS

       Well, skoal.

In the background, Mortimer is yelling louder and louder. Gibbs,

who had the glass almost to his lips, puts it down. The two

sisters watch him with expecting eyes.

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       Hello, operator! No, operator, what's taking you so long ?

       It's only across the river ! I could swim it faster ! Yes !

       Hello ! Hello...

Gibbs, who had taken the glass back to his lips, put it down once

more.

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       What ?... What, they're busy ? Busy ? They're busy and

       you're dizzy ! No, I'm not drunk, madam, but you've given

       me an idea !

A noise of chairs and various objects falling.

Mortimer comes to the table and takes the carafe and a glass.

Abby, concentrated on Gibbs raising the glass to his lips again,

doesn't see him, but Martha does, and seems very anxious about it.

She taps her two forefingers together.

       MARTHA

       Mortimer ! Ah-ah ah-ah !...

Mortimer keeps on pouring the wine in the glass

       MORTIMER

       Darling, don't ah-ah ah-ah, I'm nervous. Don't do this.

Abby sees him. She turns around, and very calmly, holds the hand

which is holding the glass.

       ABBY

       Mortimer. Not that.

He puts the glass down, and suddenly realizes the situation. He

looks at Gibbs, who has taken the glass to his lips. He yells and

Gibbs, frightened, stands up and drops the glass on the floor.

Mortimer points his finger at him.

       MORTIMER

       Get out of here ! Do you want to be poisoned, do you want

       to be murdered, do you want to be killed ? Do you ?

Gibbs grabs his hat and runs to the front door. Mortimer runs

after him and falls over an armchair standing in his way. The two

sisters seem very upset.

Gibbs gets out and slams the door.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Gibbs runs out of the house, and stops by the cab driver, who is

seated near his taxi, smoking a cigarette.

       GIBBS

       They... they're nuts !

       CAB DRIVER

       Hey, you're telling me !

Gibbs runs away in the street.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The two sisters are seated on the window-seat. Mortimer slowly

raises himself from the overturned armchair.

       MORTIMER

       Look, you can't do things like that !

He stands up and puts the armchair back on its legs.

       MORTIMER

       Now I don't know how I can explain this to you, but it's

       not only against the law, it's wrong.

He walks slowly toward them.

       ABBY

       Oh, piffle !

Both sisters are sulking.

       MORTIMER

       It's not a nice thing to do. People wouldn't understand.

He points to the front door and the departed Mr. Gibbs.

       MORTIMER

       He wouldn't understand. What I mean is... Well... This is

       developing into a very bad habit !

The telephone rings.

       MORTIMER

       Oh... Yes...

He goes to the desk, sits on the chair, and picks up the phone.

       MORTIMER

       Hello ?... Who ?... Oh, Happy Dale Sanitarium ? Oh, that's

       amazing, operator. Yeah... Happy Dale ? Oh, let me talk to

       Mister Witherspoon, please.

WITHERSPOON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR NIGHT

Witherspoon is sitting behind his desk, the telephone receiver to

his ear.

       WITHERSPOON

       Mr. Witherspoon speaking... Oh, how do you do, Mister

       Brewster ? How are you ?

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer is still at the desk, telephoning.

       MORTIMER

       Uh... uh... Well, Mister Witherspoon, do you... Oh, I'm

       fine, thanks. How are you ? Mister Witherspoon, do you

       remember that conversation we had about committing my

       brother Teddy to Happy Dale ?... You do ? Well, we want to

       commit him there immediately.

WITHERSPOON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR NIGHT

       WITHERSPOON

       Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, that's too bad. Well, I'd hoped we

       wouldn't have him for some time yet. Well, you see, Mister

       Brewster, we have several Theodore Roosevelts at the

       moment, and it would lead to trouble. Oh, trouble... Oh,

       now, if he thought that... Look, Mr. Brewster, we're a bit

       short of Napoleons at present. The Bonaparte. And if...

       Oh... oh, I see. Of course. Well, if your mind is made up.

       Yes. Yes. Have you had the papers drawn up ?

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

       MORTIMER

       No, but I'm going to attend to it right now and call you as

       soon as I have them. Thank you, Mister... What ?... All

       right. Thank you, Mister Witherspoon.

He puts the phone down.

WITHERSPOON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR NIGHT

Witherspoon puts his phone down

       WITHERSPOON

       Another Roosevelt. Oh, dear, dear.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer goes back to his aunts, still sitting on the window-seat.

       MORTIMER

       Now listen, darlings. I've got to run over to Judge

       Cullman's, but, before I go, I want you to promise me

       something.

       MARTHA

       Well, we'd have to know what it was first.

       MORTIMER

       Well, I love you both very much. And you know I'd do

       anything in the world for you, don't you ?

       ABBY

       Yes, dear.

       MORTIMER

       All right, then I want you to do one little thing for me,

       like good girls.

       ABBY

       What do you want us to do ?

       MORTIMER

       Don't do anything. I mean, don't do anything ! Don't let

       anyone in the house and leave Mr. Whosit right where he is.

       Oh ! Get off that thing. I can't talk to you... I can't

       concentrate.

He makes them stand up from the window-seat.

       MORTIMER

       Now, look, darlings, I wouldn't want anything in the world

       to happen to either of you.

       ABBY

       But, what on earth could happen to us?

       MORTIMER

       Well, darling... Anyway, you'll do that little thing for

       me, won't you ? All right.

Abby nods.

       MORTIMER

       Where's my hat ? There it is.

He leaves them to pick up his hat.

       MARTHA

       But, Mortimer.

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       What, darling, what ?

       MARTHA

       We were planning to hold services before dinner.

       MORTIMER

       Look, couldn't that wait until I get back ?

       ABBY

       Oh, and you could join us in the hymns !

       MORTIMER

       Yes, darling, I could join you in the hymns. I'll sing with

       you, I'll dance with you, I'll do anything. But...

       remember, don't let anybody in the house until I get back.

       You promise ?

Abby and Martha nod.

       MORTIMER

       Good.

He puts the hat on his head. The hat is ostensibly to large for

him. He opens the front door

       ABBY

       (voice over)

       Mortimer !

He was almost out, but he turns around.

       MORTIMER

       What ?

Abby points to the hat, but can't talk.

       ABBY

       Uh-uh-uh-uh !...

       MORTIMER

       Stop that uh-uh-uh. What is it ?

       ABBY

       Mr. Hoskins' hat !

Mortimer raises his eyes, and tears the had off his head

       MORTIMER

       Ohhhh !...

He throws the hat away, leaves and closes the door.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The cab driver is pacing back and forth on the sidewalk near his

taxi.

Mortimer comes running out of the house. The driver goes toward

him.

       CAB DRIVER

       Do you still want me to wait here ?

       MORTIMER

       Yes ! Call me a cab !

       CAB DRIVER

       Yeah. Okay, okay !

They run together and stop in front of the parked taxi. The driver

waves his arm.

       CAB DRIVER

       Hey, cab !... Here you are.

Another taxi stops near the first one. The driver wants to open

the back door for Mortimer.

       MORTIMER

       Don't open it. I'll sit with you !

       CAB DRIVER

       Yeah, that's right. I can go faster that way. Sure.

Mortimer climbs in the front of the taxi, next to the driver. The

taxi drives away, and the first driver remains on the street,

touching his cap.

       CAB DRIVER

       Wait a minute ! What am I doing ? Hey !

He pats his own taxi, points his finger to it and waves for the

other taxi to come back.

       CAB DRIVER

       Come here !

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Abby picks up Mr. Hoskins' hat. She brushes it with her hand and

gives it to Martha.

       ABBY

       Fancy getting nice Mr. Hoskins' hat all mussed up.

       MARTHA

       Shame ! Such a nice hat.

She crosses the room and, takes a brush on a cupboard near the

window-seat, and starts brushing the hat.

       MARTHA

       You know, Abby, Mortimer didn't seem to be quite himself

       today.

Abby brings two candlesticks on the table

       ABBY

       No. Oh, well.

Martha opens the cupboard, which is full of man's hats. She puts

Hoskins' hat with the others, and then closes the cupboard

       MARTHA

       Well, what were you saying about Mortimer ?

Abby has lit the candles.

       ABBY

       Oh, I think I understand why he seemed so upset.

       MARTHA

       Why ?

       ABBY

       He's just been married. I believe that always makes a man a

       little nervous.

       MARTHA

       Oh, yes. The poor dears.

She crosses the room to the door to switch off the lights

       MARTHA

       I'm so happy for Elaine. Oh, Abby ! If Mortimer's coming

       back for the services for Mr. Hoskins, we're going to need

       another hymnal. There's one up in my room.

Knocks at the front door. Through the frosted window-panels of the

door, we see the shadows of two men.

       ABBY

       Oh, I'll go, dear.

       MARTHA

       Abby, we promised Mortimer we wouldn't let anyone come in.

More knocks at the door. Martha peeks through the drapes of a

convenient window, a few steps above floor-level on the staircase.

       MARTHA

       Abby ! Two men, and I've never seen them before.

       ABBY

       Are you sure ?

       MARTHA

       Yes.

       ABBY

       Let me look.

Abby climbs the steps and comes near her sister to peek through

the drapes

       MARTHA

       You look.

The two shadows knock again.

       MARTHA

       Do you recognize them ?

       ABBY

       No, they're strangers to me.

       MARTHA

       Well, we'll just have to pretend we're not at home.

The front door opens. The tallest of the two men, dressed in black

and wearing a large hat, comes in first. The other one, shorter

and hatless, follows him.

We get a close-up of the face of the tall man, actually Jonathan

Brewster. It's full of scars and it makes him look a bit like

Boris Karloff in the Frankenstein films. He looks around the room.

       JONATHAN

       Come in, doctor.

Doctor Einstein, who was waiting at the door, comes into the room,

and closes the door behind him.

       JONATHAN

       This is the home of my youth. As a boy, I couldn't wait to

       escape from this house. Now I'm glad to escape back into

       it.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yes, Johnny, it's a good hideout.

He takes a small bottle from an inside pocket of his jacket, and

takes a sip at it.

       JONATHAN

       The family must still live here. I hope there's a fatted

       calf awaiting the return of the prodigal.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       A fatted calf ? Oh, Johnny, I'm so hungry.

He comes closer to the table.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Look, Johnny. Drink.

       JONATHAN

       As if we were expected.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yes.

       JONATHAN

       A good omen.

Einstein pours some wine from the carafe in a glass. Jonathan

takes a glass already full on the table.

Abby gets down the few steps, followed by Martha.

       ABBY

       Who are you ? What are you doing here ?

The two men put their glasses down on the table

       JONATHAN

       Aunt Abby. Aunt Martha. It's Jonathan.

       MARTHA

       You, you get out of here !

       JONATHAN

       I'm Jonathan, you know. Your nephew, Jonathan.

He takes his hat off.

       ABBY

       Oh no, you're not. You're nothing like Jonathan, so don't

       pretend you are. You just get out of here.

She points to the door.

       JONATHAN

       I see you're still wearing the lovely garnet ring that

       Grandma Brewster bought in England. And you, Aunt Martha,

       still the high collar to hide the scar where Grandfather's

       acid burned you.

       MARTHA

       Why, his voice is like Jonathan's.

       ABBY

       Have, have you been in an accident ?

       JONATHAN

       My face. Doctor Einstein is responsible for that. He's a

       plastic surgeon.

       MARTHA

       But I've seen that face before. Do you remember when we

       took the little Schultz boy to the movies and I was so

       frightened ? It was that face.

Jonathan turns around and look harshly at Einstein, who seems a

bit uneasy.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Take it easy, Johnny. Take it easy. Don't worry. The last

       five years, I give him three different faces. I give him

       another one right away. That last face. I saw that picture,

       too, just before I operated. I was intoxicated.

Jonathan grabs Einstein's collar and squeezes it.

       JONATHAN

       You see, doctor, what you've done to me ? Even my own

       family think I'm...

Einstein has breathing problems because of Jonathan's squeezing.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Johnny, Johnny ! You are home in this lovely house.

Jonathan lets go of Einstein, who walks toward the two sisters.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       You know how many times he tells me about... about

       Brooklyn, about this house, and about his aunts he loves so

       much ? They know you, Johnny. Please tell him so.

       ABBY

       Well, Jonathan, it's been a long time.

Jonathan sits down.

       JONATHAN

       Bless you. It's good to be home again.

Abby turns toward Martha, and then goes down the few last steps to

floor level.

       ABBY

       Well, Martha, we mustn't let what's on the stove boil over.

She picks up the glasses on the table.

       ABBY

       If you'll excuse us for a moment, Jonathan. Unless you're

       in a hurry to go somewhere.

She goes to the kitchen with the glasses. Martha picks up the wine

carafe, to the disappointment of Dr. Einstein, and follows her

sister toward the kitchen. Before entering the kitchen, she puts

the carafe back on the shelf where it was before. She then closes

the kitchen door after her.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Well, Johnny, where do we go from here ? You know, Johnny,

       we got to think fast.

Close-up on the hands of Jonathan playing with a metallic brain-

teaser.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       The police, they got pictures of that face. I got to

       operate on you right away. We got to find someplace. We got

       to find someplace for Mister Spenalzo, too.

While talking, he has taken another sip from his bottle.

       JONATHAN

       Don't waste any worry on that rat.

Einstein stands up.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       But we got a hot stiff on our hands.

       JONATHAN

       Forget Mr. Spenalzo.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       But, Johnny, we can't leave a dead body in the rumble seat.

       You shouldn't have killed him. Just because he knows

       something about us, what happens ?

Einstein mimes the breaking of a neck with his hands.

       JONATHAN

       We come to him for help and he tries to shake us down.

       Besides, he said I looked like Boris Karloff. That's your

       work, doctor. You did that to me.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       No, please, Johnny, take it easy. We'll find some place

       and I'll fix you up right away.

       JONATHAN

       Tonight.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yes, tonight, but I have to eat first.

The two sisters are peeking in the room through a small

rectangular hole in the door of the kitchen.

       JONATHAN

       This time, I want the face of an absolute nonentity.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yes, Johnny. I know exactly what I'm going to do.

He comes close to Jonathan and shows him on his face what he is

going to do to it.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       You see, I'm going to take this piece here and lift it

       up...

       JONATHAN

       Be careful about the stitches this time.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       You leave that up to me. I'll give you nice little ears

       and...

       JONATHAN

       You were careless last time.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       And new stitches. And on the eyes I'll do a Schmidt. That's

       my specialty. You see, I take it together like this...

       JONATHAN

       Leave the eyes alone. Leave the nose alone.

The scene dissolves to :

JUDGE CULLMAN'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY.

The judge is sitting, studying some papers. Mortimer is standing

at his side.

       JUDGE CULLMAN

       Poor Teddy. I imagine it's for the best.

He drops the papers on the desk and starts declaiming.

       JUDGE CULLMAN

       Well... Ours not to reason why, ours but to do...

Mortimer is very irritated by the Judge's erratic attitude. He

puts a pen in his hand.

       MORTIMER

       Sign right here, please, Judge. Excuse me. Right there.

       JUDGE CULLMAN

       Sometimes I think, with the world in its present chaotic

       state...

Mortimer takes the pen from the Judge's hand and starts signing

the papers.

       MORTIMER

       Yes, I know, we'd all be better off at Happy Dale. I sign

       here as next of kin, don't I ?

       JUDGE CULLMAN

       Only last week I created a mild sensation at the Bar

       Association, when I said...

Mortimer dries the document, and shakes the Judge's hand.

       MORTIMER

       Yes. Goodbye. Good luck, Judge. Thank you.

He walks to the door of the office.

       JUDGE CULLMAN

       Tell Martha and Abby I'll be over this week. I've been

       feeling rather lonely.

Mortimer comes back on his steps.

       MORTIMER

       No ! No ! Oh no ! Never tell them you've been lonely.

       Never !

       JUDGE CULLMAN

       Why, I... I... I...

Mortimer comes back to the Judge's desk.

       MORTIMER

       Judge ! Tell me, are you a drinking man ?

       JUDGE CULLMAN

       Why, no. I never indulge.

       MORTIMER

       Good ! Then you'll live longer.

He goes back to the door.

       JUDGE CULLMAN

       Of course a little wine now...

       MORTIMER

       No ! No ! For heaven's sake, no wine ! No wine !

He goes out, slamming the door behind him. The Judge looks

pensively at the door Mortimer just closed.

       JUDGE CULLMAN

       I may be committing the wrong Brewster.

The scene dissolves to :

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The Brewster sister are sitting at the table with Doctor Einstein

and Jonathan. The dinner is finished, and both men are smoking.

       ABBY

       Well, I'm sure you both want to get to wherever you're

       going.

The two sisters stands up from the table.

       JONATHAN

       My dear, sweet aunties, I'm so full of your delicious

       dinner I'm unable to move a muscle.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yes, it's nice here.

Teddy comes out of his room on the balcony. He is still wearing

his colonial costume. He has a book in his hand and a spare pith

helmet under his arm. He rushes down the stairs.

       TEDDY

       I found it ! I found it !

He stops suddenly in the staircase.

       TEDDY

       Gentlemen, be seated.

Jonathan and Einstein pretend they are standing up, but they

immediately sit back in their chairs.

Teddy comes down the last steps and goes toward the table.

       TEDDY

       Here it is, gentlemen. The story of my life, my biography.

He puts the book on the table, in front of Einstein. It's open on

a page with a picture.

       TEDDY

       Here's the picture I was telling you about, General. Here

       we are, both of us. President Roosevelt and General

       Goethals at Culebra Cut. That's me, General, and that's

       you.

Einstein looks at the picture.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       My, how I've changed !

       TEDDY

       Well, you see, that picture hasn't been taken yet. We

       haven't even started work on Culebra Cut. We're still

       digging locks. And now, General, we will both go to Panama

       and inspect the new lock.

He gives the spare helmet to Einstein.

       ABBY

       No, Teddy. Not to Panama.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Oh, maybe some other time, Mister President. Panama is a

       long ways off.

       TEDDY

       Nonsense ! It's just down in the cellar.

Jonathan, who hadn't seemed to be much interested by Teddy's

conversation, suddenly looks up.

       JONATHAN

       The cellar ?

       MARTHA

       Well, we let him dig the Panama Canal in the cellar.

       TEDDY

       General Goethals ?

Einstein slightly raises the hand holding the cigarette to his

forehead.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yes, sir.

       TEDDY

       As President of the United States, Commander in Chief of

       the Army and Navy, and the man who gave you this job, I

       demand that you accompany me on the inspection of the new

       lock.

       JONATHAN

       Teddy ! I think it's time for you to go to bed.

       TEDDY

       I beg your pardon. Who are you ?

       JONATHAN

       I'm Woodrow Wilson. Go to bed.

       TEDDY

       No, you're not Wilson. But your face is familiar. Let me

       see... You're not anyone I know now. Perhaps later, on my

       hunting trip to Africa. Yes, you look like someone I might

       meet in the jungle.

Jonathan starts standing up with a very menacing face.

       ABBY

       I think, perhaps, you had better go to bed, Teddy. He and

       his friend want to get back to their hotel.

Jonathan sits back in his chair.

       JONATHAN

       General Goethals, inspect the canal.

Einstein stands up and takes his helmet.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       All right, Mister President, we go to Panama.

       TEDDY

       Bully, bully ! Follow me, General.

He opens the door to the cellar, then turns toward Einstein, taps

on the helmet Einstein is carrying and then on his own helmet.

       TEDDY

       It's down south, you know.

Einstein puts the helmet on his head. The helmet is too large for

him, and gets down on his eyes.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Oh !

Teddy starts going downstairs. Before following him, Einstein

turns around to the others.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Well, bon voyage !

He waves them goodbye and then follows Teddy downstairs.

Jonathan has remained seated, with both his aunts standing on the

other side of the table.

       JONATHAN

       Aunt Abby, I must correct your misapprehension. You talked

       of our hotel. We have no hotel. We came here directly.

       ABBY

       This is not your home, and I'm afraid you can't stay here.

Jonathan stands up and looks menacingly at his aunts. While

talking, he moves closer to them. They look frightened.

       JONATHAN

       Doctor Einstein and I need a place to sleep. You remember

       that, as a boy, I could be disagreeable. It would not be

       pleasant for any of us if... but I don't have to go into

       details, do I ?

       MARTHA

       Perhaps we'd better let them stay here tonight.

Einstein appears at the door of the cellar.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Hey, Johnny, Johnny. Come here. Quick.

He goes back down the stairs to the cellar.

       JONATHAN

       Oh, I forgot to tell you, Doctor Einstein and I are turning

       Grandfather's laboratory into an operating room. We expect

       to be very busy.

He goes to the cellar door.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - CELLAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Einstein is on the staircase, halfway down to the cellar. On the

wall behind him, we see the shadow of Teddy digging.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Hey, Johnny, down here, what do you think I find ?

He takes off his helmet. Jonathan joins him on the stairs.

       JONATHAN

       What ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       The Panama Canal. And it just fits Mister Spenalzo. See the

       hole he's digging. Four feet wide, six feet long. He just

       fits ! You'd think he knew we were bringing Mister Spenalzo

       along. That's hospitality.

Jonathan smiles and looks upstairs.

       JONATHAN

       Rather a good joke on my aunts. They're living in a house

       with a body buried in the cellar.

Einstein laughs.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Hey, how do we get him in here ?

       JONATHAN

       Yes, we can't just walk Mister Spenalzo in through the

       door. We'll bring the car up between the cemetery and the

       house, and after they've gone to bed, we'll bring Mister

       Spenalzo in through the window.

He goes back up the stairs. Einstein follows him. The shadow of

Teddy keeps on digging.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Hey, Johnny...

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Jonathan comes in through the cellar door, with Einstein following

behind him. His two aunts are still standing up in the room.

       JONATHAN

       We're moving the car behind the house. You'd better get to

       bed.

He crosses the room with Einstein following him.

       MARTHA

       The car is all right where it is until morning.

       JONATHAN

       I don't want to leave it in the street. That might be

       against the law.

He opens the front door, and gets out, still followed by Einstein.

       MARTHA

       Abby ! What are we going to do ?

       ABBY

       Well, we're not going to let them spend more than one night

       in this house, for one thing. But what would the neighbors

       think ? People coming in here with one face and going out

       with another.

       MARTHA

       And what are we going to do about Mister Hoskins ?

       ABBY

       Oh ! Mister Hoskins ! It can't be very comfortable for him

       in there. And he's been so patient, the poor dear. Well, I

       think Teddy had better take Mister Hoskins downstairs right

       away.

Teddy enters by the cellar door.

       TEDDY

       General Goethals was very pleased. He said the canal was

       just the right size.

From the table, he picks up the book he had shown to Dr. Einstein,

and starts looking at it.

       ABBY

       Teddy ! Teddy, there's been another yellow-fever victim.

       TEDDY

       Dear me ! This will be a shock to the General.

       ABBY

       No, Teddy, we must keep it a secret.

       MARTHA

       Yeah !

       TEDDY

       A state secret ?

       ABBY

       Yes, a state secret.

       MARTHA

       Promised ?

       TEDDY

       You have the word of the President of the United States.

       Cross my heart and hope to die.

He crosses his chest and spits on the floor. Then, he takes his

aunts in his arms.

       TEDDY

       Now, let's see. How are we going to keep it a secret ?

       ABBY

       Well, Teddy, I think you'd better get back down into the

       cellar. And then, when I turn out the lights, when

       everything's dark here, you come up and take the poor man

       down to the canal. Now get along, Teddy.

Teddy crosses the room to the cellar door.

       ABBY

       And we'll come down later and hold services.

Teddy opens the door, and turns around.

       TEDDY

       Where is the poor devil ?

       ABBY

       (voice over)

       In the window-seat.

       TEDDY

       It seems to be spreading. We've never had yellow fever

       there before.

       MARTHA

       Abby. I've never even seen Mister Hoskins !

       ABBY

       Oh, my goodness! That's right, you were out. Well, you just

       come right along and see him now. You know, he's really

       very nice looking, considering that he's a Methodist.

Both sisters go to the window-seat and are ready to lift the lid,

when the drapes above the seat suddenly open wide, revealing a

very menacing Jonathan. The two sisters back off, frightened.

Jonathan slowly climbs in through the window, and stands up on the

window-seat.

       JONATHAN

       We're bringing the luggage through here.

He gets down from the window-seat. Then Einstein appears behind

the window, carrying a suitcase. Jonathan helps him to bring the

suitcase in the room.

       ABBY

       Jonathan, your room is waiting for you. You can go right

       up.

Einstein, still outside the window, gives Jonathan another

suitcase.

       JONATHAN

       I'm afraid we don't keep Brooklyn hours. You two run along

       to bed.

       ABBY

       Oh, but you must be very tired. Both of you. And we don't

       go to bed this early.

       JONATHAN

       It's time I came home to take care of you.

Behind Jonathan, Einstein has come into the room and is closing

the window, and then the drapes.

       JONATHAN

       (to Einstein)

       Take the bags upstairs.

Einstein takes the two suitcases and starts moving away.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       For the instruments, I'll come back later.

       ABBY

       Good night.

Einstein slightly bows to Abby.

       JONATHAN

       Now, we'll all go to bed.

       ABBY

       I'll wait until you're up and then turn out the lights.

Einstein has already almost reached the balcony. Martha starts

climbing, with Jonathan behind her.

       JONATHAN

       Run along, Aunt Martha. Just off the laboratory, Doctor.

Everybody reaches the balcony. Einstein disappears at the end of

the balcony, and Martha enters her room. Jonathan turns around and

looks down at Abby.

       JONATHAN

       All right, Aunt Abby.

       ABBY

       I'll be right up.

       JONATHAN

       Now, Aunt Abby ! Turn out the lights.

Abby goes to the switch near the front door, and switches the

lights off. The room is completely dark.

Abby climbs the stairs, reaches the balcony, and walks slowly pass

Jonathan, who is still standing at the same place. Then, she

quickly enters the room she shares with her sister, who is holding

the door open for her.

Jonathan moves along the balcony and starts climbing the stairs to

the upper floor. He stops after a few steps, and sees the door of

his aunts' room opening slowly. Abby comes out.

       JONATHAN

       Aunt Abby.

Abby quickly goes back into the room and closes the door. Jonathan

resumes his climbing.

The camera moves down into total black darkness, and then into the

room, where we see some light underneath the cellar door. We hear

steps, and the door opens to reveal Teddy, still in his colonial

costume, but without the helmet. He stops a few seconds, then

starts crossing the room, only lit by light coming from underneath

the kitchen door. We hear the lid of the window-seat creaking, and

we guess Teddy has just opened it. Shuffling noises. Then we see

the shadow of Teddy carrying something apparently heavy. We hear

the cat screaming, and we guess Teddy must have stepped on its

tail. When Teddy comes into the light from the open door of the

cellar, we discover he is carrying a human body, which could only

be Mr. Hoskins' one taken from the window-seat. Teddy turns around

and starts going backward down the steps to the cellar. He stops a

few seconds to close the door. Then we hear noises of something

falling, and we guess that Teddy must have missed a step and

fallen all the way down to the cellar.

Black screen during one second.

Einstein is going down the staircase, lit only by a match he is

holding in his hand.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       He's all right, Johnny.

When he gets on floor level, he meets Jonathan.

       JONATHAN

       I'll open the window. You go round and hand him through.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       But he's too heavy for me.

He burns his finger and blows the match. The scene becomes

completely dark. We see only shadows.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       You go outside, Johnny, and push, and I'll stay here and

       pull. And then together we take him down to Panama. Huh ?

       JONATHAN

       All right. We must be quick. I'll take a look around

       outside the house. When I tap on the glass, you open the

       window.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yeah.

Jonathan moves to the front door, opens it, stops to look around,

and then closes the door.

Einstein walks slowly in the room.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       It's dark in here.

He bumps into something. We hear the lid of the window-seat

creaking several times.

Einstein light another match, and we discover he has fallen into

the open window-seat, where he is now lying

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Where am I ? Oh, here I am.

He slowly gets out of the seat.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Who left this open ?

Jonathan taps on the window. Einstein blows the match and opens

the window.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Johnny ?

We see only shadows in the dark, but we guess Jonathan is handing

Mr. Spenalzo's corpse to Einstein, who will then put it in the

window-seat.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Okay, Johnny, wait a minute. Hand him over. Now I have him.

       Allez ! Up ! Now, wait a minute, Johnny. You lost a leg

       somewhere. Hey, help me. He's so heavy. Now I have him. Now

       I got him.

       JONATHAN

       Be careful.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Oh, but his shoe came off. Help me, Johnny. He's so heavy.

       Now I've got him !

Knocking at the door.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Hey, Johnny, somebody's at the door. Go open, quick.

       I'll manage Spenalzo. Go, quick !

Some more knocking. We hear the creaking of the lid of the window-

seat, and we guess Einstein is closing it.

The front door opens slowly, and Elaine enters the house.

       ELAINE

       Mortimer ! Aunt Abby !

We see the frightened face of Einstein.

       ELAINE

       (voice over)

       Aunt Martha !

Jonathan enters through the front door left open by Elaine, closes

it and locks it.

       ELAINE

       (looking frightened)

       Who is it ? Is that you, Teddy ?

       JONATHAN

       Who are you ?

       ELAINE

       I'm Elaine Harper. I live next door.

       JONATHAN

       What are you doing here ?

       ELAINE

       I came here to see my husband, Mortimer.

       JONATHAN

       Why did you say your name was Harper ?

       ELAINE

       Well, it is Harper. I mean, it's Brewster. I'm not very

       used to it. I'm a brand-new Brewster.

Einstein goes to the front door and switches the lights on.

       JONATHAN

       Doctor !

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       It's all right, Johnny. It's okay.

Einstein has his little bottle in one hand, and, with the finger

of the other hand, he tries to explain to Jonathan that the corpse

is safely in the window-seat.

Jonathan looks at Einstein, and then goes across the room to look

around. He even moves the drapes of a window to look outside.

       ELAINE

       (voice over)

       Maybe you'd better explain what you're doing here.

Jonathan keeps on checking around. He goes to the window above the

window-seat, and looks outside.

       JONATHAN

       We happen to live here.

He spots an orphan shoe on the floor and picks it up.

       ELAINE

       (voice over)

       You don't live here. I've been in this house every day, and

       I've never seen you before. Where are Miss Martha and Miss

       Abby ? What have you done to them ?

Einstein tries to explain to Jonathan, without using words, that

the shoe belongs to the corpse in the window-seat.

       JONATHAN

       Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves. May I present

       Doctor Einstein ?

He puts the shoe on the table, then lifts the tablecloth to look

underneath it.

       ELAINE

       Doctor Einstein ?

       JONATHAN

       A surgeon of great distinction. And something of a

       magician.

       ELAINE

       Now I suppose you're gonna tell me that you're Boris...

       JONATHAN

       (cutting her very harshly)

       I am Jonathan Brewster.

       ELAINE

       Oh ! You're Jonathan.

Jonathan comes close to her and looks at her in such a strange way

that she starts walking backward.

       JONATHAN

       You've heard of me ?

       ELAINE

       Yes, they talk about you.

       JONATHAN

       What do they say about me ?

Elaine stops walking backward.

       ELAINE

       Oh, just that there's another brother named Jonathan,

       that's all they say. Oh, that explains everything. Now that

       I know who you are, I'll just be running along, if you'll

       kindly unlock the door.

They move to the front door, beside which Einstein is standing,

smiling. Jonathan unlocks the door. He opens it a few inches, but

stands in the way of Elaine, ready to got out.

       JONATHAN

       That explains everything. Just what do you mean by that ?

       Why do you come here at this time of night ?

       ELAINE

       Well, I just thought I saw Mortimer drive up. I suppose it

       was you.

Jonathan slams the door and locks it.

       JONATHAN

       You thought you saw someone drive up ?

He walks menacingly toward her, and she starts walking backward

across the room.

       ELAINE

       Yes. Weren't you just outside ? Isn't that your car ?

       JONATHAN

       You saw someone at the car ?

       ELAINE

       Yes.

Einstein starts walking behind Jonathan.

       JONATHAN

       What else did you see ?

       ELAINE

       Oh, just that, that's all !

       JONATHAN

       I see. Is that why you came over here ?

       ELAINE

       Oh no, I came to see Mortimer. But if he's not home, I'll

       run...

She tries to run away, but Jonathan grabs her arms and holds it

very firmly.

       JONATHAN

       You've given two names.

       ELAINE

       You're hurting me !

       JONATHAN

       I think she's dangerous.

Teddy comes in through the cellar door. He has his helmet back on

his head and wears heavy working gloves.

       TEDDY

       No visitors. It's going to be a private funeral.

He crosses the room and starts climbing the stairs. Both Jonathan

and Einstein are now holding Elaine.

       ELAINE

       Teddy ! Teddy, tell these men who I am !

Teddy stops a few steps from floor level.

       TEDDY

       Oh, that's my daughter, Alice.

       ELAINE

       Oh, no, Teddy ! Teddy !

       TEDDY

       Now, Alice, don't be a tomboy. Don't play rough with the

       gentlemen.

He pulls out his imaginary sword and rushes up the stairs.

       TEDDY

       Charge !

He rushes into his room and slams the door.

       ELAINE

       Teddy !

Elaine starts screaming. Jonathan holds a handkerchief over her

mouth. Einstein runs to the front door and switches the lights

off.

       JONATHAN

       Doctor, the cellar.

       ELAINE

       Let go of me ! Let go of me !

The cellar door is opened, and we see the shadows of the two men

dragging Elaine down to the cellar.

       MARTHA

       What's the matter ? What's happening down there ?

The lights are switched back on, and we see Abby and Martha on the

balcony, just coming out of their room. They are both dressed in

black funeral clothes.

       ABBY

       What's the matter ? What are you doing there ?

Jonathan is coming alone out of the cellar.

       JONATHAN

       We caught a burglar, a sneak thief. Go back to your room.

       ABBY

       We'll call the police.

She starts going down the stairs, followed by Martha.

       JONATHAN

       I'll handle this. Go back to your room.

Abby stops at the top of the stairs.

       JONATHAN

       Do you hear me ?

Knocking on the door, followed by the doorbell. The two sisters

starts going down the stairs.

       JONATHAN

       Don't answer that.

Another doorbell. The two sisters are running downstairs.

       JONATHAN

       Don't answer that !

Elaine rushes through the cellar door, screaming. She runs into

Martha's arms, followed by Einstein.

       ELAINE

       Let go of me !

More knocking and ringing at the door. Abby goes and opens the

door. Mortimer enters the house..

       MORTIMER

       Where's Teddy ? Is he upstairs ?

Elaine rushes to Mortimer and holds him by the neck. He gets rid

of her.

       MORTIMER

       Never mind that now, darling, please.

He starts climbing the stairs and looks, surprised, at Martha.

       MORTIMER

       What are you doing with your best clothes on ?

He suddenly notices Jonathan's presence and stops mounting the

stairs.

       MORTIMER

       Holy... What's that ? What's that thing there that looks

       like a cigar-store dummy ?

       ABBY

       It's your brother Jonathan, and this is Doctor Einstein.

       MORTIMER

       Aunt Abby, didn't I tell you not to let anybody in the

       house ? Who did you say it was ?

       ABBY

       It's your brother, Jonathan !

Elaine grabs Mortimer's coat, and starts talking to him. So do

Abby and Martha on either side of him. Since the three of them are

talking together, it is impossible to understand what they say.

       JONATHAN

       I've come back home, Mortimer.

At the voice of Jonathan, the three women stop talking

       MORTIMER

       What ?

       JONATHAN

       I've come back home, Mortimer.

       MORTIMER

       I've come back home, Mortimer. Listen, it talks !

       JONATHAN

       Yes, I talk. Mortimer, have you forgotten the things I used

       to do to you when you were tied to the bedpost ? The

       needles under your fingernails.

Elaine grabs Mortimer's coat.

       ELAINE

       Mortimer, he...

       MORTIMER

       Wait a minute.

Mortimer walks closer to Jonathan.

       MORTIMER

       Holy mackerel ! It is Jonathan !

       JONATHAN

       I'm glad you remember, Mortimer.

       MORTIMER

       Yeah, I remember. How could I forget you ? Where'd you get

       that face ? Hollywood ?

Jonathan is ready to fight with his brother. Einstein grabs his

arm to stop him and Abby comes between them.

       ABBY

       Oh, don't you two boys start quarreling again the minute

       you've seen each other.

       MARTHA

       We invited Jonathan and Doctor Einstein to stay.

       MORTIMER

       What ?

       MARTHA

       Just for tonight.

       MORTIMER

       Oh no, you don't, I'm staying here tonight. In fact, I'm

       staying here from now on.

Elaine taps on Mortimer's arm.

       ELAINE

       Mortimer, what about me ?

       MORTIMER

       There's no room for anybody else in the house.

       (to Elaine)

       Please, darling, just a moment.

       (to Jonathan)

       So take that little squirt and beat it !

       (to Martha)

       Now where's Teddy ? I've got to see him right away. Is he

       upstairs ?

He starts climbing the stairs.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Mister Brewster ! We don't take up much room. Johnny can

       sleep on the sofa, and I'll sleep on the window-seat.

       MORTIMER

       Nothing to...

He stops going upstairs

       MORTIMER

       Window-seat ?

He comes back downstairs.

       MORTIMER

       Certainly not on the window-seat. I'm going to sleep on the

       window-seat.

He crosses the room to sit on the window-seat.

       MORTIMER

       I'm going to sleep on the windows-eat from now on.

       ELAINE

       Mortimer !

Mortimer stands up and goes to Jonathan

       MORTIMER

       Now look. Now look, Jonathan. Now, be a good fellow. Here's

       ten dollars. Go out and haunt yourself a hotel.

Jonathan throws Mortimer's money on the floor. Mortimer tries to

step on it, but instead, he steps on Jonathan's foot.

       JONATHAN

       Mortimer, you know what I do to people who order me around.

Einstein pulls Jonathan's sleeve.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Hey, Johnny. Mister Spenalzo.

Mortimer bends down to look at Jonathan foot, then he touches his

legs.

       JONATHAN

       What ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       What's going to happen to Mister Spenalzo ?

Mortimer takes a fork on the table and stabs Jonathan's leg with

it.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       We can't leave him here in the window-seat. Johnny ?

       JONATHAN

       Doctor, you know, Doctor, I've completely lost track of

       Mister Spenalzo.

       MORTIMER

       Wait ! Who's this Mister Spenalzo ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       A friend of ours Johnny was looking for.

       MORTIMER

       Don't you bring anyone else in here. Now, come on, beat it,

       both of you !

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       It's all right, Johnny. While we are packing, I'll tell you

       about him.

Jonathan walks to the staircase, and starts going upstairs,

followed by Einstein. He stops a few steps before he reaches the

balcony.

       JONATHAN

       I'll take care of you, Mortimer, in just a little while.

He resumes his walking upstairs.

       MORTIMER

       How do you like that ? The guy stays away for twenty years

       and picks tonight of all nights to come back. Oh, Elaine,

       what are you doing here ?

She falls in his arms.

       ELAINE

       Mortimer !

       MORTIMER

       What's the matter, darling ?

       ELAINE

       I almost got killed.

       MORTIMER

       Killed ? Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha !

       ABBY

       Oh, no !

       MARTHA

       Oh, no ! It was Jonathan !

       ABBY

       He mistook her for a sneak thief.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, that.

Martha just found the shoe on the table and seems very intrigued

by it.

       ELAINE

       (voice over)

       It was worse than that. He's some kind of a maniac.

Abby looks at the shoe, and seems also very intrigued. Martha

whispers something to her.

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       I know, darling, I know.

       ELAINE

       (voice over)

       Oh, Mortimer, I'm afraid of him.

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       Oh, darling, don't worry about it. I'm here now. Now forget

       it.

Abby whispers back to Martha, who puts the shoe back on the table.

The two sisters move away.

       ELAINE

       We were married today, we were going over Niagara Falls in

       a barrel, your brother tries to strangle me, a taxi's

       waiting, and now you want to sleep on a window-seat !

Mortimer hardly listens to her, but catches the last word.

       MORTIMER

       Window seat... Witherspoon. Darling, you'd better run along

       home.

       ELAINE

       What ?

       MORTIMER

       Yes, yes. Go home like a good girl. I got things to do.

He sits at the desk and starts dialing on the telephone.

       ELAINE

       Mortimer ? But... but...

       MORTIMER

       No, no, please.

       (in the phone)

       Hello ? Operator ? Get me Happy Dale 2-7-0, please.

       ELAINE

       But, Mortimer, didn't you hear what I was just saying ?

       MORTIMER

       Yes, 2-7-0.

       ELAINE

       Your own brother Jonathan, he was trying to strangle me !

       MORTIMER

       Please ! This is important !

       ELAINE

       That ?

       MORTIMER

       Hello ? Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon ? This is Mortimer

       Brewster.

WITHERSPOON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR NIGHT

Witherspoon is sitting behind his desk, the telephone receiver to

his ear.

       WITHERSPOON

       Yes, Mr. Brewster, yes.

He puts an effervescent pill in a glass of water.

       WITHERSPOON

       Well, I don't understand you.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Elaine is crying, standing near the desk, where Mortimer is still

on the telephone.

       MORTIMER

       (in the phone)

       Look, look, I...

He raises his head to look at Elaine

       ELAINE

       He was going to kill me !

       MORTIMER

       (to Elaine)

       Wait a minute, I can't hear the man.

       (to Witherspoon on the phone)

       What ? I've got the papers all drawn up. I know it's late,

       but I want you to come down here and get my brother

       immediately ! I's got to be done.

       (to Elaine)

       Please, darling, please.

WITHERSPOON'S OFFICE - INTERIOR NIGHT

       WITHERSPOON

       By the way, you've had the papers signed by your brother

       and the doctor, of course ?

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer seems surprised by the question.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, the doctor ? Oh, holy mackerel ! I forgot the doctor !

Mortimer takes a piece of paper from the inside pockets of his

jacket and puts it on the desk. Elaine is still whining at his

side.

        ELAINE

        Mortimer !

       MORTIMER

       (yelling to Elaine)

       Please, be quiet ! Can't you see I've got to get a doctor ?

       (to Witherspoon on the phone)

       Hello ? What kind of a doctor ? A family doctor ?

       ELAINE

       You can take your honeymoon, your wedding ring, your taxi,

       your window-seat, and put them in a barrel, and push them

       all over Niagara Falls !

She walks away

       MORTIMER

       (to the departing Elaine)

       Thank you, darling. Thank you.

       (to Witherspoon on the phone)

       Oh, look, why don't you come down here anyway ? While

       you're getting here, I'll get Teddy's and the doctor's

       signatures both.

The front door slams violently. Mortimer turns around.

       MORTIMER

       Yeah. Elaine ! Elaine !

       (to Witherspoon)

       Yeah, I'll get both signatures. Yeah, well, come right

       away.

He puts the phone down.

       MORTIMER

       Elaine ? What's the matter with her ?

He stands up and runs across the room to the window-seat.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, dear !

He kneels on the window-seat and looks through the open window.

       MORTIMER

       Elaine ! Elaine !

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Large shot of Reverend Harper's residence. Elaine enters the front

door, and slams the door behind her.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer is still looking through the open window.

       MORTIMER

       Elaine !

He enters back into the room, and sits on the window-seat.

       MORTIMER

       (whispering to himself)

       Oh, let me sit down. Let me think about this thing. Doctor,

       Teddy, signature...

He looks at the seat.

       MORTIMER

       Hoskins !

He remains seated a few seconds in deep thought, then he gives a

quick look outside the window, stands up and starts lifting the

lid. The lid creaks. Mortimer seems very surprised by what he sees

inside the seat. He opens the lid completely and let it rest on

the bottom of the window.

       MORTIMER

       Ye gods ! There's another one !

He closes the lid and walks across the room toward the kitchen

door.

       MORTIMER

       Aunt Abby ! Aunt Martha ! Come in here !

       ABBY

       (voice over from the kitchen)

       We're busy.

       MORTIMER

       No, you come in here now !

Abby, still in funeral clothes, enters the room through the

kitchen door.

       ABBY

       Yes, dear, what is it ? Where's Elaine ?

       MORTIMER

       Wait a minute. Didn't you promise me not to let anyone in

       the house while I was gone ?

       ABBY

       Jonathan just walked in.

       MORTIMER

       I don't mean Jonathan !

       ABBY

       And Doctor...

       MORTIMER

       And I don't mean Doctor Einstein ! Who is that in the

       window-seat ?

       ABBY

       We told you. Mister Hoskins.

       MORTIMER

       He is not Mister Hoskins !

He opens the window-seat wide and let the lid rest on the bottom

of the window.

       MORTIMER

       There !

Abby walks to the window-seat and looks inside, surprised.

       ABBY

       Who can that be ?

       MORTIMER

       You're trying to tell me you've never seen that man

       before ?

       ABBY

       I certainly am. Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do ! It's

       getting so anyone thinks he can walk in this house !

       MORTIMER

       Now, you look here, Aunt Abby. Don't you try to get out of

       this ! That's another one of your gentlemen, and you know

       it !

       ABBY

       Mortimer, how can you say such a thing ? That man's an

       impostor. And if he came here to be buried in our cellar,

       he's mistaken.

       MORTIMER

       You admitted to me you put Mister Hoskins in the window-

       seat.

       ABBY

       Yes, I did.

       MORTIMER

       Well, this man couldn't have got the idea from Mister

       Hoskins !

       ABBY

       Oh, no.

       MORTIMER

       By the way, where is Mister Hoskins ?

Mortimer starts looking around the room.

       ABBY

       He must have gone to Panama.

       MORTIMER

       What ? You buried him ?

       ABBY

       No, no, not yet. He's just down there waiting for the

       services, poor dear. We haven't had a minute, what with

       Jonathan in the house.

Mortimer suddenly realizes the corpse could be a friend of

Jonathan. He quickly closes the lid.

       ABBY

       Oh, dear. We've always wanted to hold a double funeral.

       But I will not read services over a total stranger !

She walks back to the kitchen. Mortimer catches her.

       MORTIMER

       A total stranger. Aunt Abby, how can I believe you ? There

       are twelve men down there, some you admit you poisoned

       them !

       ABBY

       Yes, I did. But you don't think I'd stoop to telling a

       fib ! Martha !

She enters the kitchen.

       ABBY

       Martha ! Martha ! What do you think has happened ?

       MORTIMER

       A fib !

Mortimer starts dancing around the room. Then he hears a door

closing on the balcony, and he sits on the window-seat. We see

Jonathan on the balcony. He starts going downstairs. Mortimer goes

toward him.

       MORTIMER

       Jon... Oh-oh... Ah-ah...

       JONATHAN

       This may interest you, Mortimer. I've decided that we're

       staying. And I've also decided that you're leaving, and I

       mean now.

       MORTIMER

       Listen, handsome. I'm in no mood to debate the question.

       Are you getting out, or am I throwing you out on your ear?

       JONATHAN

       I've led a strange life, Mortimer.

Abby comes in through the kitchen door, followed by Martha.

       ABBY

       Martha, you come straight along here. You just look and see

       what's in that window-seat.

Jonathan and Mortimer both rushes across the room and sit on the

window-seat

       MORTIMER

       No. No, no, Aunt Abby, don't...

He stops when he realizes that Jonathan is sitting with him. He

suddenly understands the situation, and shows a broad smile to his

brother. He then stands up

       MORTIMER

       Jonathan, let Aunt Martha see what's in the window-seat.

Jonathan's face shows that he is no more so sure of himself.

       MORTIMER

       Aunt Abby, darling, I owe you an apology.

He kisses her on the forehead.

       MORTIMER

       I've got some very good news for you. Jonathan is leaving.

       And he's taking Doctor Einstein and that cold companion

       with him.

       (to Jonathan)

       Listen, Jonathan. You're my brother, you're a Brewster. So,

       I'm giving you a chance to get away and take the evidence

       with you. You can't ask for more than that. Well ?

Jonathan doesn't move from the window-seat.

       MORTIMER

       All right, in that case, I'll have to call the police.

He goes to the desk.

       JONATHAN

       Don't reach for the telephone. Remember, what happened to

       Mister Spenalzo can happen to you, too.

Mortimer picks up the phone.

       MARTHA

       Spenalzo ?

       ABBY

       I knew he was a foreigner.

       JONATHAN

       Put down that telephone, Mortimer.

Jonathan puts his hand to his pocket, to take his gun. The

doorbell rings and we see a policeman's shadow through the frosted

glass. Jonathan stands up and Abby rushes to the door.

       ABBY

       Oh...

She opens the door on O'Hara. He is smiling and he's got his stick

in his hand.

       O'HARA

       Hello !

       ABBY

       Oh, Officer O'Hara !

       O'HARA

       I saw the lights and thought you might have sickness in the

       house...

       ABBY

       No...

He looks around.

       O'HARA

       Oh, you got company ? Oh, I'm sorry I disturbed you.

He starts to walk back out, but Mortimer stops him.

       MORTIMER

       No ! Come in.

       ABBY

       Yes, do come in.

She closes the door behind him.

       MARTHA

       Come right in, Officer O'Hara. This is our nephew,

       Mortimer.

They shake hands, both smiling.

       O'HARA

       Oh, pleased to meet you.

       MORTIMER

       And glad to see you, fellow.

       ABBY

       And this is another nephew, Jonathan.

       O'HARA

       Pleased to make your acquaintance. Hey, your face is

       familiar. Haven't I seen a picture of you somewhere

       before ?

       JONATHAN

       I don't think so.

       O'HARA

       I'll be running along.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, come on. What's the hurry ? Why don't you stick around

       until my brother leaves.

       O'HARA

       I got to ring in, Mr. Brew... Say, you're not the

       Mortimer Brewster, the book-writer and the dramatic critic,

       are you ?

       MORTIMER

       Yes, why ?

       O'HARA

       Oh, what a break for me ! I'm a playwright.

       MORTIMER

       No ?

       O'HARA

       I'm working on a play now.

       MORTIMER

       You are ?

       O'HARA

       Yeah.

       MORTIMER

       Well, well, well ! Maybe I can help you with it.

       O'HARA

       Oh, would you ? Oh, what a break ! I get wonderful ideas,

       but I can't spell them.

       MORTIMER

       You can't ?... Oh, I can spell like the dickens.

       Constantinople ? Come on, come on, let's go into the

       kitchen.

       O'HARA

       All right.

       MORTIMER

       You can tell me all about it.

       (to Abby)

       Couldn't you whip up a sandwich for Officer O'Hara ?

       MARTHA

       I hope you don't mind eating in the kitchen, Officer

       O'Hara.

       O'HARA

       And where else would you eat ?

They all enter the kitchen, laughing, and leaving Jonathan alone

in the room. Mortimer lets them in, but comes back into the

sitting-room, closing the kitchen door behind him.

       MORTIMER

       (to the policeman and his aunts)

       See you in a moment.

He crosses the room toward Jonathan

       MORTIMER

       Now, listen, Jonathan, this is your last chance. I'll keep

       O'Hara busy in the kitchen and give you a chance to get

       out. All three of you : you, Doctor Einstein and Spenalzo.

       JONATHAN

       Mortimer...

       MORTIMER

       Now if you don't leave here in five minutes, I'll bring in

       Officer O'Hara, and introduce him to Mr. Spenalzo.

He opens the lid of the window-seat. But O'Hara comes into the

room and Mortimer quickly closes the lid.

       O'HARA

       Mister Brewster, my play takes place in...

Mortimer moves him back to the kitchen.

       MORTIMER

       I'll be right with you, O'Hara. Right with you. Right with

       you. Just give me one moment.

Mortimer closes the door behind O'Hara and turns toward Jonathan.

       MORTIMER

       Now get going ! All three of you.

He enters the kitchen, and closes the door behind him. Einstein

arrives silently behind Jonathan and taps on this shoulder.

Jonathan turns quickly around. He then goes to the kitchen door

and comes back to Einstein.

       JONATHAN

       Doctor, this affair between my brother and myself has got

       to be settled.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       But, Johnny, we've got trouble enough as it is. Come, let's

       go.

       JONATHAN

       We're not going. We're going to sleep right here in this

       house.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       What ? With a cop in the kitchen and Spenalzo in the

       window-seat ?

       JONATHAN

       That's all he's got on us. We'll take Spenalzo and dump him

       in the bay. After that, we're coming back here. Then if he

       tries to interfere...

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       No, no, Johnny. No, please.

       JONATHAN

       Doctor, we've got a wonderful setup here. We can make a

       fortune. Two old ladies as a front. Only Mortimer stands in

       our way. I never did like Mortimer.

He goes toward the kitchen door. Einstein catches up with him.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       No, Johnny, please, take it easy. Please !

       JONATHAN

       Doctor, you know when I make up my mind...

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yeah, I know, when you make up your mind, you lose your

       head. Look, Johnny, Brooklyn ain't a good setup for you.

Jonathan takes Einstein's hand, twists it and brings Einstein down

on the floor.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Okay, Johnny. Okay !

Jonathan releases Einstein's hand, who stands up to massage his

hand.

       JONATHAN

       Take the instruments and hide them in the cellar. Move

       fast.

Einstein takes the suitcase and walks to the cellar. Jonathan

opens the lid of the window-seat.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

In the kitchen, the Brewster sisters are moving around the room,

preparing food on the table. Both men are standing up near the

table. O'Hara, without his cap on his head, has a sandwich in his

hand.

       O'HARA

       Mister Brewster, you don't know what goes on in Brooklyn.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, I don't know.

O'Hara picks up a cup on the table.

       O'HARA

       No. My mother was an actress.

       MORTIMER

       Oh ? Legitimate ?

       O'HARA

       Of course she was. She was my mother.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, excuse me.

       O'HARA

       Peaches La Tour was her name.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

The door to the cellar is open. Einstein rushes up from the

cellar. He looks a bit frightened.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Hey, Johnny, Johnny, come quick !

Jonathan, who was looking down into the open window-seat, stands

up.

       JONATHAN

       What's the matter ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       You know that hole in the cellar ?

       JONATHAN

       Yes.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Well, we got an ace in the hole.

Jonathan closes the window-seat, and walks toward the cellar.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT

O'Hara is explaining something to Mortimer.

       O'HARA

       It's no fly-by-night idea. I've been working on this thing

       for twelve years.

Mortimer, who had just heard the creaking of the lid of the

window-seat, turns back toward the policeman.

       MORTIMER

       Well, you have ?

       O'HARA

       Yeah.

       MORTIMER

       Well, rehash it in your mind. I'll be back in a minute.

       O'HARA

       Oh, swell.

       MORTIMER

       I like the first act.

       O'HARA

       But I didn't tell you the first act, Mister Brew... I...

Before he can finish his sentence, Mortimer is already out of the

room.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer enters the empty sitting-room. He goes to the window-

seat, opens it and talks to the corpse.

       MORTIMER

       No, I thought I told you...

He closes the lid, kneels on the seat and looks through the open

window.

       MORTIMER

       Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan !

Jonathan enters from the cellar, followed by Einstein.

       JONATHAN

       Yes, Mortimer.

Mortimer turns around and looks, surprised, at his brother. Then

he comes into the room

       MORTIMER

       What are you two doing still here ? I thought I told you to

       beat it.

       JONATHAN

       We're not going.

       MORTIMER

       You're not going ?

       JONATHAN

       No.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       No.

       MORTIMER

       You stay out of this. All right, you asked for it.

He goes to the kitchen door, which he opens slightly.

       MORTIMER

       Officer O'Hara ?

       O'HARA

       (voice over from the kitchen)

       Coming.

Mortimer comes back in the middle of the room.

       JONATHAN

       Now, if you tell O'Hara what's in the window-seat, I'll

       tell him what's down in the cellar.

       MORTIMER

       Cellar ?

       JONATHAN

       There's an elderly gentleman down there who seems to be

       very dead.

       MORTIMER

       What were you doing down the cellar ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       But what is he doing in the cellar ?

       JONATHAN

       Now what are you going to tell O'Hara ?

O'Hara comes into the room from the kitchen.

       O'HARA

       Hey, your aunts heard my opening, it's swell. They want to

       hear the rest. Shall I bring them in here ?

He starts going back into the kitchen, but Mortimer stops him.

       MORTIMER

       No, no, no, no. You can't do that now. You'd better ring

       in.

       O'HARA

       Oh, the heck with ringing in ! You got me rolling now.

       I want to tell you the whole plot.

       MORTIMER

       You know, you can't tell me in front of those two fellas,

       they wouldn't appreciate it.

       O'HARA

       Huh ? Hey, lowbrows, huh ?

       MORTIMER

       Let's go some place we can be alone. I'll meet you there

       later.

O'Hara puts his cap back on his head.

       O'HARA

       Okay. Say ! How about the back room at Kelly's ?

       MORTIMER

       Kelly's ?

       O'HARA

       Yeah.

       MORTIMER

       Oh yeah, fine place for Bohemian atmosphere. Genius at

       work.

He escorts O'Hara to the front door.

       MORTIMER

       You ring in and I'll meet you at Kelly's.

       O'HARA

       Fine.

       MORTIMER

       Fine.

       JONATHAN

       Why don't you both go down in the cellar ?

       O'HARA

       That's all right with me.

O'Hara starts moving toward the cellar, but Mortimer stops him.

       MORTIMER

       No, no, no. There's a much more literary atmosphere in

       Kelly's, I assure you.

       O'HARA

       Okay.

       MORTIMER

       We'll meet later

       O'HARA

       This opening will kill you.

He opens the door and starts going out.

       MORTIMER

       You will.

       O'HARA

       I'm waiting to be born, you see, and the doctor comes in...

Mortimer, who was pushing O'Hara outside, suddenly slaps his

forehead with his hand.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, the doctor !

       O'HARA

       Yeah !

       MORTIMER

       Yeah. Now, Look, you ring in and I'll see you later.

       O'HARA

       Okay. You won't stand me up, will you, Mister Brewster ?

       MORTIMER

       No.

       O'HARA

       This is a great play, you'll like it. I'll see you down

       there.

       MORTIMER

       Can't wait ! Can't wait !

Mortimer closes the door.

       MORTIMER

       Doctor, doctor. Where are those papers ? Oh, there they

       are.

He goes to the desk and picks up his papers. He then turns to

Jonathan and Einstein, still standing by the cellar door.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, oh-oh ! You're smug, aren't you? You think you've got

       it over me. But you haven't. You think I'm afraid to go to

       the police about Spenalzo because you've got hold of

       Hoskins. Well, I'm not !

He taps on his papers.

       MORTIMER

       The moment I get Spenalzo... I mean, the moment the doctor

       signs this, I don't care who knows about him, Hoskins, I

       mean. And you better feel the same way about Spenalzo. Yes,

       Spenalzo !

He starts running upstairs.

       JONATHAN

       Where are you going ?

       MORTIMER

       To the Doctor. Where do you... Oh !

Mortimer stops and starts running downstairs, and then to the

front door.

       MORTIMER

       When I come back, I expect to find you gone. Wait for me !

He goes out and closes the door. Einstein takes a sip at his

bottle.

       JONATHAN

       We'll wait for him.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Did he look guilty !

The two sisters come out of the kitchen.

       ABBY

       Well, Martha, I think we can start the services now.

They stop when they see Jonathan and Einstein.

       ABBY

       Oh ! We thought we heard you leave.

       JONATHAN

       Perish the thought, dear aunties. That was just Mortimer.

       And speaking of services, Aunt Martha, will you make us

       some coffee while we take Mister Spenalzo down to the

       cellar ?

       MARTHA

       Oh, no. No, Jonathan. You've got to take him with you !

Jonathan opens the lid of the window-seat.

       JONATHAN

       There's a friend of Mortimer's downstairs waiting for him.

       ABBY

       A friend of Mortimer's ?

       JONATHAN

       Take his feet, Doctor. Mister Spenalzo and he will get

       along fine together. They're both dead.

The two men bend down to take the corpse out of the window-seat.

       MARTHA

       Oh ! He must mean Mister Hoskins.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Mister Hoskins ?

The two men stand up and look at the sisters. Jonathan comes

closer to them.

       JONATHAN

       You know about what's down there ?

       ABBY

       Of course we do. And he's no friend of Mortimer's. He's one

       of our gentlemen.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Your gentlemen ?

       MARTHA

       Yes. And we won't have any strangers buried in our cellar.

       JONATHAN

       But Mister Hoskins ?

       MARTHA

       Mister Hoskins is no stranger.

       ABBY

       Besides, there's no room for Mister Spenalzo. The cellar's

       crowded already.

       JONATHAN

       Crowded ? With what ?

       ABBY

       There are twelve graves down there now.

The two men look at each other. Jonathan seems the most surprised.

       JONATHAN

       Twelve graves.

       ABBY

       That leaves very little room and we're going to need it.

       JONATHAN

       You mean that you and Aunt Martha have murdered twelve...

       ABBY

       Murdered ? Certainly not. It's one of our charities.

       MARTHA

       Why, what we've been doing is a mercy.

       ABBY

       So you just take your Mister Spenalzo out of here.

They turn to Einstein, who has seated himself and is laughing his

head off.

       JONATHAN

       You've done all that right here in this house and buried

       them in the cellar ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       That's wonderful, Johnny !

He stands up.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       We've been chased all over the world, and they stay right

       here in Brooklyn, and they do just as good as you do.

       JONATHAN

       What ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yeah. You got twelve, they got twelve.

Jonathan grabs Einstein by his shirt.

       JONATHAN

       I've got thirteen.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       No, Johnny, twelve. Don't brag.

       JONATHAN

       Thirteen.

They both starts counting on their fingers.

       JONATHAN

       There's Mister Spenalzo. Then the first one in London.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yeah.

       JONATHAN

       Two in Johannesburg, one in Sydney, one in Melbourne, two

       in San Francisco, one in Phoenix, Arizona.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Phoenix ?

       JONATHAN

       The filling station.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Filling st... Oh, yes.

He mimes the gesture of one having his throat cut.

       JONATHAN

       Three in Chicago and one in South Bend. That makes

       thirteen.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       You cannot count the one in South Bend. He died of

       pneumonia.

       JONATHAN

       He wouldn't have died of pneumonia if I hadn't shot him.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       No, no, Johnny, you cannot count him. You got twelve, they

       got twelve. The old ladies is just as good as you are.

Both sisters seem very happy by Einstein's statement. They smile.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       They are, are they ? That's easily taken care of. All I

       need is one more. That's all. Just one more. And I've a

       pretty good idea who it is.

He looks menacingly at his two aunts, who do not smile anymore.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer is walking along the gate of the churchyard, dragging Dr.

Gilchrist with him. Gilchrist is trying to tie his necktie while

walking. Apparently, Mortimer didn't let him dress completely when

he took him out of his home.

       MORTIMER

       I'm a very lucky man to have caught you at home, Doctor

       Gilchrist.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST

       This is most irregular, most irregular.

       MORTIMER

       I'm sorry to have dragged you out of bed, but, you see,

       you're the only one who can help me.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST

       I know Teddy blows bugles, but I can't commit a man to an

       institution just on that.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, well, if only you had a little talk with him, I assure

       you you'd be convinced by him. Here's the house I...

They stop walking when they hear hymns sung by the Brewster

sisters.

       MORTIMER

       There goes Hoskins.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST

       Who ?

Mortimer looks embarrassed : he doesn't want to explain to the

doctor who Hoskins is.

       MORTIMER

       What ? What ? Did I say... Oh, I...

He moves the doctor to the entrance of the churchyard.

       MORTIMER

       Now, you better wait.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST

       Here ?

       MORTIMER

       Yes, I'll bring Teddy out. Well, you see, I wouldn't want

       to alarm the old ladies, you know, seeing a doctor and

       everything. You wait here, huh ?

He helps him finish tying his necktie.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST

       In the cemetery ?

       MORTIMER

       Yeah, that'll be good.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST

       It's Halloween.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, don't worry about that. At Halloween, the pixies won't

       be out till after midnight. Now look, you wait here. Make

       yourself comfortable. Pull up a tombstone. I'll be right

       back.

He moves away to the house, and passes near the taxi, still

waiting.

       CAB DRIVER

       Hey, 22.50 !

       MORTIMER

       What ?

       CAB DRIVER

       22.50 !

       MORTIMER

       Oh, yes, looks good on you !

He hasn't stop walking, and goes into the house. The driver, who

had been following him, stops near the entrance of the house.

       CAB DRIVER

       Yeah ! Not the suit, the meter ! Looks good on me.

       22.50 !

A quick shot of Dr. Gilchrist waiting, frozen and slightly

frightened.

Then back on the entrance of the house, near which the driver is

still standing. Teddy and Mortimer come out of the house. Teddy is

back in his President Roosevelt costume.

       TEDDY

       Did you give him a twenty-one-gun salute ?

       MORTIMER

       Yes, with a Maxim silencer.

The driver catches up with them.

       CAB DRIVER

       Hey, you. Five more bucks and you'll own it.

Mortimer and Teddy don't stop walking. The driver follows them.

       MORTIMER

       Oh no, thanks. It wouldn't fit me.

The two men reach the place where Dr. Gilchrist is waiting.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, Mister President, may I have the pleasure...

Teddy seems very happy to meet Dr. Gilchrist, and shakes his hands

vigorously.

       TEDDY

       Doctor Livingstone !

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST

       Livingstone ?

       MORTIMER

       (to the doctor)

       Well, that's what he presumes.

       (to Teddy)

       Mister President, the doctor would like to have a few words

       with you in private.

He bows slightly.

       TEDDY

       Certainly. Welcome to Washington, doctor.

He shakes his hand again, then puts his arm around the doctor's

shoulders and moves away with him into the churchyard.

       TEDDY

       Arlington is beautiful at this time of year, is it not,

       doctor ?

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST

       Yes, indeed.

The doctor looks back at Mortimer, seeming a little frightened.

Mortimer remains alone, with the papers in his hand. We still hear

the hymns sung by the Brewster sisters in the background.

       MORTIMER

       Well now, that's that. It gives me a chance to rest.

He sits down on a tombstone.

Reverse shot on Reverend Harper's house. Elaine opens the window

of her room.

Back to Mortimer seated on his tombstone. A little further behind

him, we see Teddy and the doctor talking.

       MORTIMER

       Well, so far, so good.

He stands up.

       MORTIMER

       Not so good.

He runs to Elaine's window.

The cab driver looks at the scene with intrigued eyes.

Mortimer is now outside Elaine's window.

       ELAINE

       Do you or do you not love me ?

       MORTIMER

       Oh, Elaine. Elaine, how can you say such a thing ? Darling,

       of course I love you.

       ELAINE

       Do you ?

Mortimer takes her in his arms.

       MORTIMER

       Yes, darling.

       ELAINE

       Hey, then why have you been treating me the way you have ?

       MORTIMER

       Oh, Elaine.

He moves slightly away from her.

       MORTIMER

       Elaine, Elaine, darling, I love you so much, I can't go

       through with our marriage.

She goes slightly back into her room.

       ELAINE

       Have you suddenly gone crazy ?

       MORTIMER

       No, no, I don't think so, but it's only a matter of time.

       Now, look, darling, you wouldn't want to have children

       with three heads, would you ? I mean, you wouldn't want to

       set up housekeeping in a padded cell.

       ELAINE

       What are you talking about ?

       MORTIMER

       Well, I don't quite know really. Look, I probably should

       have told you this before, but you see... well, insanity

       runs in my family.

We hear very clearly the Brewster sisters singing their hymns.

       MORTIMER

       It practically gallops.

       ELAINE

       Oh, darling, just because Teddy's a little strange, that

       doesn't mean...

       MORTIMER

       Oh no, darling, no, no. It's way back before Teddy. No,

       this goes back to the first Brewster, the one who came over

       on the Mayflower. Yeah. You know, you know how in those

       days the Indians used to scalp the settlers ? Well, he used

       to scalp the Indians.

Elaine bends out of her window to hug Mortimer.

       ELAINE

       Darling, that's ancient history.

Medium shot on the doctor and Teddy walking arm in arm among the

tombstones.

       TEDDY

       Yes, Doctor, I'll run for a third term, but I won't be

       elected. And that'll mean the last of the Roosevelts

       in the White House.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST

       That's what you think.

       TEDDY

       Of course, if the country insists...

Back to Elaine's room window. The young couple is still talking on

either side of the window.

       ELAINE

       Oh, darling, all this doesn't prove a thing. Look at your

       aunts. They're Brewsters, aren't they ? They're the

       sweetest, sanest people I've ever known.

       MORTIMER

       Yeah.

He turns around to listen to his aunts singing their hymns.

       MORTIMER

       Well, even they have their peculiarities.

       ELAINE

       What of it ? So your family's crazy. So you're crazy.

       That's the way I want you, the way I love you. I'm crazy

       too, but kiss me.

       MORTIMER

       No, no. I... Ohhh !

Mortimer hesitates a little and then gives a passionate kiss to

Elaine.

Back to Teddy and the doctor. Teddy is vigorously shaking the

doctor's hand.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST

       Goodbye, Ambassador. I've enjoyed this little talk very

       much. Anytime you're in Washington, drop in to see me at

       the White House.

He walks away, leaving the doctor very shaken by the experience.

The doctor runs to Mortimer, still outside Elaine's window and

kissing her passionately. The doctor clears loudly his throat to

attract Mortimer's attention.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST

       Those papers. Those papers.

       MORTIMER

       Go away.

Mortimer suddenly realizes what the doctor is talking about.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, papers ! Papers ! Yes.

He pulls the papers from his jacket pocket, and gives them to the

doctor.

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST

       I'll enjoy committing him to any place.

       MORTIMER

       You will ?

       DOCTOR GILCHRIST

       I've just been appointed Ambassador to Bolivia !

       MORTIMER

       Ah, you see ? Didn't I tell you ?

Elaine suddenly slams her window down... on Mortimer's fingers !

Mortimer yells because of the pain. The doctor looks up from the

papers. Elaine also shut the inside shade down, shutting the room

completely from the outside world.

       MORTIMER

       No. Don't worry about that. Just go on signing the papers.

       Oh dear. Thank you.

Mortimer blows on his hurt fingers, then grabs the papers from the

doctor and runs away.

       MORTIMER

       Okay, thank you.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Close-up on the empty window-seat, where just remains Mr.

Spenalzo's hat.

From the open cellar door, Martha is coming out, followed by Abby.

They are still dressed in their funeral clothes.

       ABBY

       All right ! All right ! We'll find out whose house this

       is ! I'm warning you, you better stop it. There's no use

       doing what you're doing, because it'll just have to be

       undone.

       JONATHAN

       (voice over from the cellar)

       Aunt Abby, go to bed !

       ABBY

       It's a terrible thing to do to bury a good Methodist with a

       foreigner.

Mortimer comes rushing into the room with the papers in his hand.

       MORTIMER

       Hello.

He blows on the papers to dry the ink of the signature.

       ABBY

       Mortimer, where have you been ?

Mortimer starts running upstairs.

       MORTIMER

       Uh-uh ? Oh, I was getting some papers signed. Is Teddy in

       his room ?

       MARTHA

       Oh, Mortimer, what is the matter with you ? Running around

       getting papers signed at a time like this.

       ABBY

       Martha and I are going for the police.

       MORTIMER

       Police !

He quickly get back downstairs

       MORTIMER

       Oh-oh-oh ! Wait-wait-wait ! You can't go for the police.

       MARTHA

       Oh, no ? You know what Jonathan's doing ?

       ABBY

       He's putting Mister Hoskins and Mister Spenalzo in

       together.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, darling, let him.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - CELLAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Einstein just finished working, and he is cleaning the bottom of

his pants. We notice he is wearing Mr. Spenalzo's shoes. A shovel

is resting on the wall near him.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       This is all fixed up nice now. Nice and smooth like a lake.

       The President will be very proud of his Panama Canal.

He stretches himself

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Oh, Johnny, bed feels good already. You know, we didn't get

       any sleep for forty-eight hours.

Jonathan walks behind him, carrying a shovel. He puts the shovel

down against the wall and start mounting the stairs

       JONATHAN

       You're forgetting, Doctor.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       What ?

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer is trying to calm his aunts down

       ABBY

       Now, look. If Jonathan and Mister Spenalzo aren't out this

       house before morning, we're going for the police.

       MORTIMER

       Yeah, but I'll get them out, I promise you that !

       ABBY

       Then you get the wedding silver.

       MORTIMER

       Yes, but remember, no police ! No police ! All right.

He starts mounting the stairs.

       MORTIMER

       There's a thing. Look, go to bed, will you ? Fine. Get out

       of those clothes ! You two look like a double blackout.

He reaches the balcony.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - CELLAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

Jonathan is standing on the bottom of the cellar staircase.

       JONATHAN

       My brother, Mortimer.

He goes back down in the cellar toward Einstein, who has his

bottle in his hand.

       JONATHAN

       I just heard him upstairs.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       No, no, no ! I am tired. You forget, I got to operate on

       your face tomorrow.

He sits down on the bottom steps of the stairs.

       JONATHAN

       (voice over. We just see his shadow on the wall behind

       Einstein)

       You are going to operate tomorrow, Doctor. But tonight we

       are taking care of Mortimer.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       No, but Johnny, not tonight ! I'm sleepy. We'll do it

       tomorrow. Or the next day.

       JONATHAN

       (voice over from the shadow on the wall)

       Look at me, Doctor. You can see that it's got to be done,

       can't you?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yeah, I know that look.

       JONATHAN

       (voice over from the shadow on the wall)

       It's a little late to dissolve our partnership.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Okay, okay, Johnny, okay. We'll do it. But the quick way,

       huh ? The quick twist like in London.

He mimes the breaking of a neck with his fingers, and then takes a

sip from his bottle

       JONATHAN

       (voice over from the shadow on the wall)

       No, Doctor. I think this calls for something special. I

       think, perhaps, the Melbourne method.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Not the Melbourne method, please ! Two hours ! And then

       when it was all over, what ? The fellow in London was just

       as dead as the fellow in Melbourne.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Teddy comes out of his room on the balcony, in his President

Roosevelt costume. He takes his bugle to his mouth, ready to play

it. Mortimer comes out of the room and lowers the bugle.

       MORTIMER

       No, no, no. Don't do that, Mister President.

       TEDDY

       But I cannot sign any proclamation without consulting my

       Cabinet.

Mortimer puts the papers in front of his eyes.

       MORTIMER

       This must be secret.

Teddy takes the papers and looks at them.

       TEDDY

       A secret proclamation ? How unusual.

       MORTIMER

       Yes, it's the only way we can outsmart the other fellow.

       TEDDY

       Who's the other fellow ?

       MORTIMER

       That's the secret.

       TEDDY

       Oh, I see ! Very clever. Well, if it's a a secret

       proclamation, it has to be signed in secret.

He folds the papers.

       MORTIMER

       Of course, Mister President.

       TEDDY

       I'll have to put on my signing clothes.

He starts to move back to his room. Mortimer stops him.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, you already have them on, Mister President.

Teddy looks at his costume.

       TEDDY

       So I have. Wait here.

He goes back into his room and closes the door. Einstein appears

at the bottom of the stairs.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Hey, Mister Brewster.

       MORTIMER

       Yes, what is it ? Mice ?

Einstein climbs the stairs very rapidly. He takes Mortimer by the

sleeve and whispers to him.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Hey, Mister Brewster, you get out of this house.

       MORTIMER

       Can't you see I'm busy ?

He tries to get rid of Einstein's hand on his sleeve.

We hear the bugle playing the first notes of Beethoven's fifth

symphony.

       MORTIMER

       (singing the same tune)

       Ta-ta-ta taaa !

He knocks on Teddy's door. The papers are slid under the door.

Mortimer bends down to pick them up.

       MORTIMER

       Thank you, Mister President. Oh, what a load off my mind.

       Boy, could I use a drink ! Thank God for that.

He starts going downstairs. Einstein follows him and takes his

sleeve again.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       (whispering)

       Get out of here, will you, please ?

       MORTIMER

       Huh ? What did you say ? Speak up, sonny. I can't hear you.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       (still whispering)

       Johnny's in a bad mood. You get out of here !

       MORTIMER

       Stop underplaying. I can't hear you.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Please listen to me. Get out.

Mortimer gets rid of Einstein's hands on his sleeves.

       MORTIMER

       Stop all this ! What are you doing ? Look, Doc. Are you

       really a doctor ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yes, Heidelberg, 1919. You go...

He takes his sleeve again and tries to move him to the front door.

       MORTIMER

       Heidelberg ? How'd you... How'd you come to hook up with

       Jonathan ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       I tell you later about that, but you go now. Please listen

       to me.

They've reached the front door. Mortimer takes Einstein's hand out

of his sleeve.

       MORTIMER

       Tch-tch-tch ! Stop it, Doctor, now stop it !

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       You get out of here ! Look, look, when Johnny's in that

       mood, he's a madman. He's a maniac ! And then things

       happen. Horrible things.

He mimes the cutting of his own throat, and takes Mortimer's hand

to throw him out.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       You get out of here !

       MORTIMER

       Will you stop it ? Now look, stop telling me about

       Jonathan, I'll take care of Jonathan, and you take care of

       yourself. Now, get going, little fellow.

He opens the door to throw him out. He pats him on the behind to

move him, and discover the shape of the bottle under his hand.

       MORTIMER

       What's that ? What's that ? Wait a minute.

He takes the bottle out of Einstein's pocket

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Oh no ! My schnapps !

       MORTIMER

       I could use that. I could use that.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       That's mine.

He tries to get his bottle back, but Mortimer holds on it.

       MORTIMER

       Please. Only for dramatic critics. Now look, you beat it

       before things start popping around here.

He moves away to the table, with the bottle in his hand. Einstein

joins his hand in a praying gesture.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       But, look, Mr. Brewster, please. You've just been married.

       You have a nice little wife waiting for you. Please go now.

       Please.

Mortimer pours some of the schnapps in a glass.

Einstein slams the front door with a very nervous punch, and walks

toward Mortimer. He mumbles incomprehensible words, probably in

German.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Tell me, don't those plays you see all the time teach you

       anything ?

Mortimer is drinking. He lowers his glass.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, stop it, don't get me on the subject of plays ! I've

       got a lot on my mind now. I've got to wait here for Mister

       Witherspoon.

He looks at his watch.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       At least people in plays act like they got sense.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, you think so ? Did you ever see anybody in a play ever

       act like they got intelligence ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       How can somebody be so stupid ?

       MORTIMER

       You ought to have my job a few nights. Listen to me,

       brother. When you get out of prison, you have yourself

       wheeled over to the Garrick Theater. Oh ! Oh ! There's a

       play there that's been running so bad that it'll still be

       running when you get out. Now, in this, there's a man...

       Now listen to this...

Behind Mortimer, the cellar door opens silently and Jonathan

enters slowly into the room, without Mortimer noticing him.

       MORTIMER

       Now, he knows he's in the house with murderers. So he ought

       to know he's in danger. He's even been warned to get out of

       the house. And does he go ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yes.

       MORTIMER

       No, he doesn't. He stays ! This fellow doesn't even have

       sense to be scared or to be on his guard. No, no. The

       murderer even invites him to sit down. What do you think he

       does ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Well, I don't know.

       MORTIMER

       He sits down ! I remember what he did. He deliberately

       pulls up a chair like that and he sits down in it.

Mortimer goes to a wooden armchair and sits down in it. He puts

his glass on the table.

       MORTIMER

       Isn't that great ? So there he is, all waiting to be

       trussed up and gagged. What do you think they used to truss

       him up with ?

He keeps on laughing while talking.

Close-up of Jonathan's face, smiling.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       (voice over)

       Oh, what ?

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       The curtain cord.

Jonathan looks in the direction of the window... and the curtain

cord.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Curtain cord ? But didn't he see him get it ?

Behind the seated Mortimer, Jonathan is silently walking to the

window.

       MORTIMER

       Seen him get it. No. The silly chump sits down with his

       back toward the murderer.

Mortimer turns slightly on his chair, but without taking his eyes

off Einstein, and, of course, without looking at his brother

behind him, quietly cutting the curtain cords with a jack-knife.

       MORTIMER

       All he has to do is look around, but does he ? No !

Medium shot on Jonathan cutting the curtain cords.

       MORTIMER

       (voice over)

       No... Look, you see, brother Heidelberg, in a play or even

       in a movie, for that matter, ...a fellow never sees or

       hears anything. No. That's right.

Jonathan folds the jack-knife and puts it in his pocket. He

prepares the cords he has just cut. Einstein takes a napkin on the

table.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       But what does he do ?

       MORTIMER

       Oh, what does he do ? Well, the big chump sits there. This

       fellow's supposed to be bright. He sits there.

Jonathan is now just behind Mortimer's chair, with the cord ready

in his hands.

       MORTIMER

       Now get a load of this. Look, look at the attitude. Large

       as life ! He sits there waiting to be tied up and gagged.

       The big dope !

He bursts out laughing... But only for two seconds, because

Jonathan ties up his arm to the armchair from behind, and Einstein

shoves the napkin in his open mouth. Einstein then helps Jonathan

to tie Mortimer's legs to the legs of the armchair. Then, with the

help of a knife, he puts all the napkin in Mortimer's mouth.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       You were right about that fellow. He wasn't very bright.

Fade out, and then fade in on the same scene a few moments later.

The lights have been dimmed. Mortimer is completely tied on the

chair, and the gag is tied around his head.

       JONATHAN

       Yes, Mortimer. I've been away for twenty years. But never,

       my dear brother, were you out of my mind.

Jonathan is lighting candles on the table.

       JONATHAN

       In Melbourne one night, I dreamt of you.

He opens his instruments case. We see the surgery instruments

shining in the candles light.

Close-up on Mortimer's very frightened face.

Einstein sits down near the table. He seems depressed at the sight

of his surgery instruments.

Jonathan takes a small phial from the inside pocket of his jacket,

opens it, smells it and closes it, and puts it back in his pocket.

       JONATHAN

       The more you struggle, Mortimer, the more you strangle

       yourself. Later on, you may consider that a blessing.

He takes a curved forceps from the case and plays with it.

Close-up on Mortimer's frightened face.

Einstein wipes his face with a napkin.

Jonathan takes a scalpel from the case and feels the sharpness of

the blade.

Einstein takes a bottle on the table and brings it to his mouth.

Unfortunately, the bottle is empty.

Jonathan takes a pair of surgery gloves from the box and puts them

on.

       JONATHAN

       Now, Doctor, we go to work.

Einstein stands up.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Johnny, for me, please, the quick way. Please.

       JONATHAN

       Doctor, this must be an artistic achievement.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Please.

       JONATHAN

       After all, we're performing before a very distinguished

       critic.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Johnny, please !

       JONATHAN

       Doctor !

Einstein takes his jacket off. He is almost crying.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       All right. Let's get it over with. No, but, Johnny, I

       cannot see this without a drink.

       JONATHAN

       Pull yourself together, Doctor.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       But I can't pull myself together without a drink. Johnny,

       you remember when we came in here, there was some wine. And

       then they took it. Where did they put it ?

A glint of hope appears in Mortimer's eyes at the mention of his

aunts' wine.

Einstein runs across the room to the shelves where the carafe of

poisoned wine has been put away.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Johnny, I found some wine. I found some wine.

He comes back to the table with the carafe and glasses.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Here, I'll split it with you. We both have a drink before

       we operate. Oh, I am so happy that we don't have to operate

       without a drink.

Einstein gives a glass to Jonathan. Mortimer, who recognized the

carafe, is smiling behind his gag. Jonathan smells the glass.

Einstein has his glass almost to his lips, when Jonathan stops

him.

       JONATHAN

       Doctor. One moment, please. Where are your manners ?

       (to Mortimer)

       Yes, Mortimer. I realize now that it was you who brought me

       back to Brooklyn. We drink to you. Doctor ! To my dear,

       dead brother.

They clink their glass in front of Mortimer's face. Einstein

raises his glass before drinking.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Prosit !

Teddy suddenly comes out of his room and plays his bugle very

loudly.

Both Jonathan and Einstein drop their glass on the floor.

Teddy then goes back into his room and slams the door. The grand-

father clock chimes once.

Mortimer seems very disappointed. He moves back and forth in his

chair, moaning.

       JONATHAN

       That idiot ! He goes next. That's all. He goes next !

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Not Teddy ! Not Teddy ! Please !

       JONATHAN

       We'll get to him later.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Not Teddy, we won't get to him at all !

       JONATHAN

       Now, we have to work fast. The quick way.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Oh, the quick way, oh yes ! If it has to be, then the quick

       way. Yes, I'll help you with it.

They starts getting the instruments out of the case.

At the front door, we see the shadow of a policeman behind the

frosted glass. He rings the doorbell.

Jonathan and Einstein stop what they were doing. Einstein closes

the case and puts it under the table. He also puts all the

instruments lying on the table on the floor, behind the case.

Knocking on the door. The door being open, O'Hara enters the room.

He spots Jonathan and Einstein.

       O'HARA

       Hey, the colonel has to quit blowing that horn.

       JONATHAN

       It's all right, Officer. We're taking the bugle away from

       him.

       O'HARA

       I'd better talk to him myself. Where's the lights ?

He finds the switch by the door, and switches the lights on. He

goes to the stairs and starts mounting them, when he hears

Mortimer moaning. He goes down and walks toward Mortimer.

       O'HARA

       Hey ! You stood me up ! I've been waiting for you for over

       an hour at Kelly's. What happened to him ?

O'Hara is surprised to find Mortimer tied up on his chair. He

points his stick to Jonathan.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Nothing. He was explaining a play he saw the other night

       and that's what happened to a poor man in the play.

He walks away with his jacket in his hands.

       O'HARA

       Oh, I see. Did that really happen in a play you saw ? How

       do you like that ? You can't trust nobody no more. They

       practically stole that from the second act of my play. You

       know, in the second act, just... Well, maybe I'd better

       start at the beginning.

Mortimer is moving and moaning on his chair. He tries to explain

by movements of his face that he would like to have his gag taken

off.

Behind O'Hara, Einstein starts mounting the stairs, and Jonathan

stands up at the bottom of them.

       O'HARA

       Huh ? Oh, yes, sure.

He puts his hands to Mortimer's face to take off his gag.

Einstein runs upstairs, followed by Jonathan.

Suddenly, O'Hara removes his hands and smiles broadly.

       O'HARA

       Nooo ! You've got to hear the plot !

He takes his jacket off.

       O'HARA

       My mother's sitting there, making up, see. And, like a

       flash, suddenly, out of a clear sky, the door comes open

       and a man with a black mustache comes in.

On the stairs behind O'Hara, Jonathan takes his jack-knife out of

his pocket and opens it.

       O'HARA

       He turns to my mother and he says, Miss Peaches La Tour,

       will you marry me ? That's the first scene. My mother

       doesn't tell him they're married. That's the surprise !

Einstein, who has seen the knife, tries to stop Jonathan. But

Jonathan keeps on walking slowly downstairs.

       O'HARA

       Oh, What a kick ! All right. Twenty-five years pass. Well,

       in the meantime, there's me. Growing into a magnificent

       specimen. So what do I do ? I join the police force and

       become one of New York's finest. Well, I'm cleaning out a

       crooked laundry, see ?

Close-up on Jonathan's hand holding the knife, the blade of which

is shining in the light.

Mortimer stares at the knife

       O'HARA

       Little do I know it, but there is a dope fiend with a long

       knife crawling after me. I'm in great danger. It's getting

       you, ain't it ? I can see it in your eyes.

Actually, Mortimer's eyes are trying to attract O'Hara's attention

to Jonathan, just behind him now.

       O'HARA

       Well, you ain't heard nothing yet.

Einstein tries to stop Jonathan, but Jonathan pushes him away.

Einstein takes off one of his shoes, and hits Jonathan very hard

on the head with it. Jonathan falls on the floor.

       O'HARA

       All of a sudden, a fire breaks out. What an effect ! The

       firemen rush in and who do you think is leading them ?

       Mayor Fiorello La Guardia !

O'Hara turns around and sees Jonathan lying on the last steps of

the stairs.

       O'HARA

       What's the matter with him ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yeah, probably your play put him to sleep.

       O'HARA

       What ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       I personally, I like it very much.

       O'HARA

       It's probably over his head, huh ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yeah.

O'Hara looks at Jonathan's face.

       O'HARA

       Where have I seen that face before ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       No, please.

He kneels beside Jonathan's body, and O'Hara returns to Mortimer.

       O'HARA

       Well, the scene changes. It's an evolving stage. I'm

       walking along my beat, well, like that, casual-like, when a

       guy that I'm following, it turns out he's really following

       me !

Knocks at the door. O'Hara turns to Einstein.

       O'HARA

       (to Einstein)

       Don't let nobody in.

       (to Mortimer)

       I figure I'll outsmart him. There's a vacant house on the

       corner.

Einstein peeks through the drapes to have a look at the outside of

the front door. He rushes to Jonathan.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Hey, Johnny, the cops !

Einstein tries to wake up Jonathan, but doesn't succeed. He picks

up his shoe and rushes upstairs.

       O'HARA

       So, I ducks in there. I sees the door handle turn, so I

       pulls out my gun, braces myself against the wall and I

       says : Come in !

He takes out his gun and points it at the door. Brophy and another

cop, officer Saunders, come in. When they see O'Hara's gun

pointing at them, they raise their arms. O'Hara puts his gun back

in his holster and welcomes his colleagues.

       O'HARA

       Oh, hello, boys.

       BROPHY

       What the Sam Hill's going on here ?

       O'HARA

       Hello Sarge, what do you think, this is Mortimer Brewster.

       He's going to help me write my play.

       SAUNDERS

       Do you have to tie him up to make him listen ?

He starts to untie Mortimer.

       BROPHY

       O'Hara, you better report in the station. Why didn't you

       ring in ? You got the whole force out looking for you.

       O'HARA

       Right in the middle of the second act. Did they send you

       guys here looking for me ?

Brophy goes to the telephone and starts dialing.

       BROPHY

       No, we came to warn the old ladies. There is a difficulty.

       The colonel blew that bugle again.

       O'HARA

       Yeah, I heard him.

       BROPHY

       The neighbors are all phoning in. The Lieutenant's on the

       warpath. He says we've got to put him away someplace.

He sees Jonathan lying on the steps.

       BROPHY

       Now, who the heck is this ?

       O'HARA

       Oh, that's Mister Brewster's brother. My play put him to

       sleep.

       BROPHY

       Oh ! That's the one that ran away. So he came back.

       (in the phone)

       Brophy. Get me Mac.

       (to O'Hara)

       Haven't you got yourself in a mess ! You're two hours

       overdue at the station. I better let them know that I found

       you.

O'Hara bends on Jonathan and shakes him

       O'HARA

       Hey ! It wasn't that bad, was it ?

       BROPHY

       (in the phone)

       Mac ? Tell the Lieutenant he can call off the big manhunt.

       We found him... At the Brewster house... Shall we bring him

       in ?... All right, we'll hold him right here.

He puts the phone down and turns to O'Hara, who has succeeded in

waking up Jonathan and getting him on his feet. Jonathan stares at

Brophy. He thinks Brophy is talking about him.

Mortimer looks at his left hand, which has just been freed by

Saunders.

       BROPHY

       The Lieutenant is on his way over.

       JONATHAN

       So I've been turned in, hey ? All right, you've got me. I

       suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother will split the

       reward.

Brophy and O'Hara each take one arm of Jonathan.

       BROPHY & O'HARA

       Reward ?

       JONATHAN

       Yes, reward ! Now I'll do some turning in !

Mortimer, who had his hand and legs untied by Saunders but is

still gagged and has his chest still tied on the armchair, moans

and moves excitedly on his seat.

       O'HARA

       (to Jonathan)

       Oh, wait a minute, Mr. Brewster.

       JONATHAN

       You think my aunts are sweet, charming old ladies, don't

       you ? Well, there's thirteen bodies buried in the cellar !

       Yes, thirteen.

Mortimer jumps on his chair and try to scream through his gag.

Since he cannot succeed to get off the chair, he stands up, still

gagged and tied to the back of the chair and rushes to Brophy,

carrying the armchair with him.

       BROPHY

       Be careful what you say about your aunts, they happen to be

       friends of ours.

       JONATHAN

       I'll show them to you.

       BROPHY

       Don't you make any trouble for them, do you hear me !

Mortimer walks between Brophy and Jonathan, and tries to say

something to Brophy through his gag. Saunders, behind Mortimer,

keeps on untying him.

       BROPHY

       (to Mortimer)

       Never mind, Mr. Brewster. Leave him to me, I'll take care

       of him.

       JONATHAN

       (to O'Hara)

       You come down to the cellar.

       O'HARA

       (to Jonathan)

       Now, wait a minute.

Mortimer is still trying to talk through his gag to O'Hara and

Brophy, and moves excitedly around the two cops. He moves so much

that Saunders has stopped trying to untie him.

       JONATHAN

       Thirteen bodies. I'll show you where they're buried.

       O'HARA

       Oh, yeah !

       BROPHY

       Go down to the cellar with him, O'Hara.

       JONATHAN

       Yes, come to the cellar.

He grabs O'Hara's hand and drags him to the cellar door.

       O'HARA

       Well, look, do I have to ?

Mortimer, still gagged, and still carrying his armchair like a

backpack, tries to follow them, but Saunders moves him away.

Mortimer runs round the table to try again to join the party going

down to the cellar, with Saunders running behind him.

       O'HARA

       Sorry, maybe I don't want to go down to the cellar with

       him.

Mortimer bumps violently into Brophy, who tries to push him away.

       BROPHY

       O'Hara, go on down the cellar with him !

Mortimer then goes to O'Hara, but O'Hara doesn't realize Mortimer

is coming to him to prevent him going down to the cellar.

       O'HARA

       Now, please, Mister Brewster. I'll tell you the rest of my

       play later.

He pushes Mortimer away from him.

       BROPHY

       Go on down to the cellar with him.

       O'HARA

       Gee, do I have to, Sarge ? Look at that puss. He looks like

       Boris Karloff.

Hearing that, Jonathan screams, jumps on O'Hara and puts his hand

around his throat.

       O'HARA

       (to Jonathan)

       Don't !

       (to Brophy)

       Sarge !

The three cops and Jonathan starts fighting. A fist comes out of

the battle and hits Mortimer on the chin. He staggers back to the

center of the room, and falls on the floor.

We see Einstein cautiously appearing on the landing of the upper

floor of the house. He slowly comes down the stairs.

Down in the sitting-room, the fight goes on. Saunders falls on his

back and Jonathan jumps on him. O'Hara, in his turn, jumps on

Jonathan. Behind them, Mortimer is slowly getting up and getting

rid of his ropes. Apparently, his fall has completely untied him.

Einstein, watching this heated fight, moves back to the upper

floor.

Mortimer gets rid of his gag, and slowly moves away from the

battle.

       BROPHY

       (voice over)

       Look out, Pat !... Look out, Pat !

       SAUNDERS

       (voice over)

       He's got a gun...

       BROPHY

       (voice over)

       I got him, Pat. Look out !

       MORTIMER

       Fight. Go on and fight.

Mortimer climbs up a few steps on the staircase and sits down on a

step.

       MORTIMER

       That's enough, that's enough. Everybody off.

       BROPHY

       (voice over)

       Pat ! Pat, look out!

Mortimer, still seated on the step, quietly gets his cigarette

case from his pocket, takes a cigarette, puts the case back in his

pocket, while we hears the noise of the battle still going on down

below.

       MORTIMER

       Amazing... Such a fine day, too. All I did was cross the

       bridge and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing. Amazing, amazing.

He takes a matchbox from another pocket and lights his cigarette.

Behind Mortimer, on the wall, we see the shadows of the men

fighting. Then we see various objects falling around Mortimer.

       MORTIMER

       Don't... Don't bother me now.

O'Hara is projected on the wall below the staircase, near the

place where Mortimer is still quietly seated.

       MORTIMER

       Buddy, you could use this in the third act.

       O'HARA

       Oh yes, I got something better than this. Let me tell

       you...

Jonathan breaks a chair on his back. O'Hara staggers slightly.

       O'HARA

       I'll see you later.

He goes back in the battle. Jonathan gives him a heavy punch and

O'Hara falls in the window-seat, closing the lid over himself in

his fall.

Back to Mortimer, still quietly smoking his cigarette, seated on

the same step. He takes papers out of his pocket.

       MORTIMER

       I got the papers signed. There, they're all signed. What do

       I care ? Go ahead, go ahead, fight, fight, fight-fight-

       fight !

O'Hara cautiously lifts the lid of the window-seat, but seeing a

chair flying in his direction, he slams it back shut. The chair

hits the window-seat and breaks off in small pieces.

Back to Mortimer on his steps. He puts the papers back in his

pocket.

       MORTIMER

       I'd better call up and see if Witherspoon has left.

He puts his hand through the banister of the staircase to take the

telephone on the desk, but he cannot reach it.

       MORTIMER

       Telephone. Hey !

At this moment, Jonathan comes smashing on the wall below the

staircase. He grabs the telephone and lifts it to throw it on the

cops, bringing it within easy reach of Mortimer's hand.

       JONATHAN

       I'll get every one of you ! I hate cops. I'll brain the

       first one that comes near me !

Mortimer picks up the telephone handset, and starts dialing.

       MORTIMER

       Yeah. A little higher, please, brother.

Jonathan is watching the cops around him, and he is not looking at

all at his brother behind him. Without thinking about it, he lifts

the telephone a little higher.

       MORTIMER

       Thank you very much. Yeah, that's fine.

Jonathan suddenly realizes what Mortimer is doing and turns his

head toward him. Brophy immediately comes behind him and hits him

with his stick. Jonathan starts falling, and Mortimer has to pick

up the telephone not to loose it.

       MORTIMER

       Oh ! Don't do that, please.

       BROPHY

       Get him, Pat.

Saunders comes on the other side of Jonathan and hits him with his

stick.

       MORTIMER

       (in the phone)

       Come on, doc...

       (to the cops)

       That won't have any effect. I've tried it before...

Jonathan falls heavily on the floor.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, it did. Dear me ! Isn't that amazing ?

O'Hara slowly lifts the lid of the window-seat.

Saunders bends on the motionless body of Jonathan

       MORTIMER

       Oh, dear. Wish I could relax like that.

The doorbell rings, and we see the shadow of a hatted man through

the frosted glass. Mortimer looks at the door.

       MORTIMER

       Witherspoon !

       BROPHY

       Come in.

The visitor enters. It's Lieutenant Rooney, a plain-cloth

policeman. He closes the door behind him. Both Brophy and Saunders

stand at attention. Mortimer puts the phone receiver back on its

hook. O'Hara comes out of the window-seat, and, seeing his

superior, stands at attention. Rooney walks to the body of

Jonathan.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       What has occurred ?

       BROPHY & SAUNDERS

       (speaking together)

       Well, we...

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Never mind ! Didn't I tell you I'd handle this myself ?

O'Hara comes out of the window-seat to join his colleagues.

       O'HARA

       Well, Lieutenant ! We were just acting in self-defense.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       (pointing to the body of Jonathan)

       What happened ? He put up a fight ?

       BROPHY

       This isn't the one who blows the bugle. This is his

       brother. He tried to kill O'Hara.

       O'HARA

       All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Boris ?... Turn him over.

Saunders turns Jonathan over and both the lieutenant and Brophy

bends on the face of Jonathan.

       BROPHY

       Kind of think he's wanted somewhere.

Rooney stands up and looks at Brophy with an ironical smile.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Oh ! You kind of think he's wanted somewhere ? If you

       guys can't look at the circulars we put up in the station,

       you can at least read short detective stories. Certainly,

       he's wanted somewhere. In Indiana ! He escaped from the

       prison for criminally insane. He's a lifer.

Still seated on his step, Mortimer smiles.

       MORTIMER

       That's my brother !

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       For Pete's sake, that's the way they described him. He

       looked like Karloff. Why'd you have to knock him off ?

       BROPHY

       He tried to get us to go down to the cellar. He says there

       are thirteen bodies buried down there.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Thirteen bodies buried in the cellar, and that don't tip

       you off the guy's come from a nuthouse ?

       MORTIMER

       Thanks, pal.

       O'HARA

       Say, lieutenant, about my not ringing in, I want to

       explain...

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Where have you been all night ? Don't bother to tell me.

       O'HARA

       Oh, I was right here writing a play with Mortimer Brewster.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Yeah ?

       O'HARA

       Yeah.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Well, you're going to have a long time on that play.

       O'HARA

       Yeah ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       You're suspended. Now go on. Report in.

Teddy comes out of his room, with his bugle under his arm, and

walks downstairs

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       (voice over)

       Take this guy out in the kitchen and bring a pillow. I want

       to find out where his accomplice is.

       TEDDY

       (to Mortimer)

       What is the meaning of this commotion ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       The guy who helped him escape. He's wanted, too.

Teddy gives his bugle to Mortimer.

       TEDDY

       Here.

He joins the group of policemen.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Forty-eight hours I've been after these guys. Nothing to

       eat. No sleep. No wonder Brooklyn's in the shape it's in.

       With flatheads like you on the force. Falling for a story

       like that ! Thirteen bodies buried down in the cellar.

       TEDDY

       But there are thirteen bodies in the cellar !

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Who are you ?

       TEDDY

       I'm President Roosevelt.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       (whispering to Brophy)

       What the blazes is this ?

       BROPHY

       He's the guy that blows the bugle.

       SAUNDERS

       Howdy, Colonel.

Saunders and Brophy both salutes Teddy. Teddy salutes them back.

Rooney raises his hand to salute, but rapidly puts it down with a

disgusted expression on his face.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Well, Colonel, you've blown your last bugle.

       (pointing to Jonathan's body)

       Come on, get this guy out of here.

       TEDDY

       Dear me ! Another yellow-fever victim ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       What ?

       TEDDY

       All the bodies in the cellar are yellow-fever victims.

       BROPHY

       No-no-no, Colonel. This is a spy. We caught him at the

       White House.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Take him out and bring him to. I want to question him.

Brophy and Saunders lift Jonathan and carry him to the kitchen.

       TEDDY

       If there is any questioning of spies, that's my department.

He follows the two cops. But Rooney stops him.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Hey, you, keep out of that.

       TEDDY

       You're forgetting that as President, I am also head of the

       Secret Service.

He follows the two cops in the kitchen. Rooney goes to the table,

takes the carafe and smells it. Mortimer watches him, still seated

on his step.

       MORTIMER

       Huh-huh-huh !

Rooney puts the carafe back on the table, and looks at Mortimer.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Who are you ? What's your name ?

       MORTIMER

       Usually, I'm Mortimer Brewster. But I'm not quite myself

       today.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Oh, you're his brother. Now, look, Mister Brewster, no

       argument. He's got to be put away.

Mortimer stands up and goes down the steps toward the lieutenant.

       MORTIMER

       No, no, no arguments, Captain. No arguments. Just a minute,

       take it easy. Read this.

He takes the papers from his pocket and show them to Rooney.

       MORTIMER

       Teddy's going to go to Happy Dale tonight. I'm just waiting

       here for Mr. Witherspoon.

Rooney looks at the documents.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Well, as long as he's going someplace. He's scaring the

       neighbors, what with that bugle and all. And that cockeyed

       story about thirteen bodies being buried...

Rooney stops, looks around with a suspicious eye and takes his hat

off.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       You know, I've been without sleep for forty-eight hours.

       I'm liable to think anything.

       MORTIMER

       I know just how you feel.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       There's people dumb enough to believe a story like that.

       Last year there was a crazy guy, started a murder rumor. I

       had to dig up a half acre plot before I could prove...

       Ohh ! What's this ?

Rooney puts the papers down.

       MORTIMER

       What's the matter ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       These papers are no good.

       MORTIMER

       Why not ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       He signed it Theodore Roosevelt !

Rooney shows the papers to Mortimer.

       MORTIMER

       He what ?...

Mortimer looks at the papers with horror in his face and takes

them back.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

The cab driver is seated with O'Hara and Witherspoon standing on

either side of him.

       WITHERSPOON

       Is your cab engaged ?

       CAB DRIVER

       Yeah ! I'm losing dough every minute. Got me offers ?

       WITHERSPOON

       I'm Mister Witherspoon of Happy Dale Sanitarium, I have

       come here to collect a Brewster. I would like you to drive

       us back to the sanitarium.

He walks to the entrance of the house. O'Hara stays with the cab

driver.

       CAB DRIVER

       I knew this would end up in a nuthouse !

Witherspoon comes back a few steps.

       WITHERSPOON

       We like to think of it as a rest home.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

Witherspoon enters the room. We hear voices talking excitedly. And

we see people in some sort of a large alcove at the back of the

sitting-room, between the cellar-door and the grandfather clock.

       WITHERSPOON

       Mister Brewster ? Mister Brewster ?

Through the hole in the kitchen door, we see Brophy talking.

       WITHERSPOON

       Mr. Witherspoon is here.

Witherspoon slams the door.

In the alcove, Mortimer, Rooney and Teddy are having an argument.

Mortimer still has the bugle in his hand.

       MORTIMER

       Supposing the spy steals this document and finds the name

       Theodore Roosevelt on it. Think what that would mean to the

       safety of the nation !

Rooney holds the document for Teddy, who has a pen in his hand.

       TEDDY

       No, it's chicanery.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, wasting the time.

Saunders approaches his lieutenant.

       SAUNDERS

       He's come to. He's ready to talk.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Hold him till I get there.

       SAUNDERS

       Yes, sir.

He moves away back to the kitchen.

       MORTIMER

       Let me explain. The name Brewster is code for Roosevelt.

       TEDDY

       Code for Roosevelt ?

       MORTIMER

       Yes, don't you see ? Take the name Brewster. Take away the

       B and what have you got ?

       TEDDY

       Rooster.

       MORTIMER

       And what does a rooster do ?

       TEDDY

       Crows.

       MORTIMER

       It crows! And where are you hunting in Africa ?

       TEDDY

       On the veldt !

       MORTIMER

       There you are ! Crowsveldt.

Mortimer gives a quick look at Rooney.

       TEDDY

       Ingenious ! My compliments to the boys in the code

       department.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Hey, that's all right ! Do that again for me.

       TEDDY

       Never mind ! Give me that pen. This is fun.

He signs the paper under Rooney's supervision.

       MORTIMER

       Now, now, all I got to get is Witherspoon.

He runs to the table in the middle of the sitting-room, where

Witherspoon is standing. He goes around the table to shake hands

with him.

       MORTIMER

       Oh ! Oh ! Mister Witherspoon, I can't tell you how glad I

       am to see you. Mister Witherspoon... Before... Look... You

       will take good care of Teddy at Happy Dale ?

       WITHERSPOON

       Best of care of him, Mister Brewster.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, that's fine. And no wagon when he leaves.

       WITHERSPOON

       Why ? To take him away ? Oh, never, never. Taxicabs. We

       always... I have one waiting now.

       MORTIMER

       Yes, look, it means a great deal to me. You will personally

       see that Teddy's happy at Happy Dale ?

       WITHERSPOON

       He'll be very happy at Happy Dale.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, that's good.

       WITHERSPOON

       You know, I sometimes envy some of our patients, secretly,

       you know.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, you do ? It must be a nice place. Because I've never

       been to Happy Dale.

       WITHERSPOON

       You never can tell.

Mortimer looks surprised by Witherspoon's answer. Then he looks

also a bit horrified.

       WITHERSPOON

       Oh, this is a particularly happy moment for me tonight,

       Mister... Mister Brewster. Yes, I've never met a dramatic

       critic and I had been so anxious to.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, the woods are full of them.

       WITHERSPOON

       I have here something that will explain what we're trying

       to do out there at Happy Dale.

He gets a booklet out of his pocket.

       MORTIMER

       Oh ! A pamphlet about Happy Dale ?

       WITHERSPOON

       Oh, no-no, it's a play. Something I've been working on for

       some time now.

When Mortimer sees Witherspoon flipping the pages of his booklet,

a slightly frightened look comes to his face.

       WITHERSPOON

       It's a dramatization of many of the little incidents

       that have happened here at Happy Dale.

       MORTIMER

       Captain ! Captain !... Captain !

Rooney, who was checking the documents signed by Teddy, turns

around.

       WITHERSPOON

       Now, I want you to read this very carefully. I want you to

       be just as harsh as you like. I shan't mind, you know...

Rooney comes toward them with the documents in his hand.

       MORTIMER

       Captain, this is Mister Witherspoon.

Witherspoon looks at Rooney with a smile.

       WITHERSPOON

       Oh, yes, yes, he'll be very happy at Happy Dale. Come, my

       boy.

Witherspoon takes Rooney's arm. Rooney pushes him away.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       What is this?

       MORTIMER

       No, no, no-no, Mister Witherspoon, you got it wrong. This

       is... this is Captain Rooney.

       WITHERSPOON

       The police ?... Oh !

The two men shake hands, and Rooney gives the papers to

Witherspoon.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       I'm sure! Here are the papers, all signed. Now you can take

       him away, Super.

Teddy joins them.

       TEDDY

       I'll be in my office vetoing some bills.

       MORTIMER

       Mister President, I have good news for you. Your term of

       office is over.

       TEDDY

       Is this March the four ?

       MORTIMER

       Practically.

       TEDDY

       Let's see... Oh ! Now I go on my hunting trip to Africa !

       Well, I must get started immediately.

Teddy starts walking away, but he stops suddenly and gives

Witherspoon a suspicious look.

       TEDDY

       Is he trying to move into the White House before I've moved

       out ?

       MORTIMER

       Who, Mister President ?

Teddy looks at Witherspoon with a disgusted face.

       TEDDY

       Taft !

       MORTIMER

       No, no, Teddy this isn't Mister Taft. It's Mister

       Witherspoon, he's going to be your guide to Africa.

Teddy shakes hands with Witherspoon.

       TEDDY

       Bully ! Bully ! Wait right here. I'll bring down my

       equipment.

Witherspoon looks at Teddy walking away with a sweet smile.

       WITHERSPOON

       Happy man.

Teddy starts going upstairs and he meets Abby and Martha coming

down. They're dressed back in their usual clothes. Teddy shakes

hands with them.

       TEDDY

       Goodbye, Aunt Abby, goodbye Aunt Martha. I'm on my way to

       Africa. Isn't it wonderful ?

For the last time, Teddy takes out his imaginary sword, points it

forward and rushes upstairs.

       TEDDY

       Charge !

He gets into his room and slams the door behind him. Witherspoon

looks a bit surprised, and Mortimer holds the hands of the

grandfather clock. Abby joins him

       MORTIMER

       It's all right, Aunt Abby, I've got it.

Witherspoon looks at the scene with slightly anxious eyes.

       WITHERSPOON

       Oh, dear. And Happy Dale is full of staircases.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Elaine walks across the churchyard toward the Brewster's house.

She is wearing a coat over her nightdress.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Abby and Martha are talking with Witherspoon.

       MARTHA

       You've come to meet Teddy, haven't you ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       (voice over)

       No, he's come to take him. Teddy's been blowing his bugle

       again.

Both sisters turn toward Rooney.

       ABBY

       Oh, no-no, no, he can't go now ! We won't permit it.

       MARTHA

       We promise to take his bugle away from him. We won't be

       separated from Teddy.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       I'm sorry.

       ABBY

       Mortimer, how can you allow this ? You promised.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Mister Brewster's got nothing to do with this, see. The law

       is the law ! Teddy's committed himself and he's got to go.

       ABBY

       Well, if he's going, we're going, too !

       MARTHA

       Yes, you'll have to take us with him.

Mortimer smiles broadly.

       MORTIMER

       Why-why... why not ? Why not, indeed ?

       WITHERSPOON

       Oh well now, indeed, it's sweet of them to want to go, but

       it's quite impossible. We never take sane people at Happy

       Dale.

Mortimer comes very close to Witherspoon, and tries, by mime only,

to induce Witherspoon to take his aunts.

       WITHERSPOON

       Oh, no-no-no-no...

       MORTIMER

       (whispering)

       Now, these two little sane people, mixed up with all the

       others, will get lost in the shuffle. You could arrange

       that.

       WITHERSPOON

       Oh, no-no-no-no...

       MORTIMER

       Just put them in and they'll get all mixed up.

       WITHERSPOON

       Oh, no ! No, no ! No ! Too dangerous. Dissension, jealousy.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Elaine has now reached the Brewster house and opens a window. We

hear Lieutenant Rooney's voice.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       (voice over)

       Now, let's be sensible, ladies...

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Rooney is talking to the Brewster sisters.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       ...Here I am wasting my time when I could be doing some

       serious work. You know, ladies, there are still murders

       to be solved in Brooklyn. It ain't only his bugle blowing,

       and neighbors being afraid of him. But things are going to

       get worse. We're liable to have to dig up your cellar.

       ABBY

       Our cellar ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Yeah.

Mortimer seems a bit worried.

       MORTIMER

       Oh-oh !

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Yeah, Teddy's been telling around there's thirteen bodies

       buried in the cellar.

       ABBY

       But there are thirteen bodies in our cellar.

Witherspoon, who was looking at something on the table, looks up,

very surprised by what Abby just said.

Behind the window and the drapes, where she is hiding and

eavesdropping, Elaine looks very surprised too.

Rooney smiles a little, and then becomes suddenly very serious.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       What ?

       ABBY

       Yes. You just ask our nephew, Mortimer.

Mortimer blows the bugle very loudly. Rooney puts his hands on his

ears. Then Mortimer rushes upstairs, yelling :

       MORTIMER

       Charge !

Mortimer reaches the balcony. Teddy comes out of his room, looking

intrigued

       MORTIMER

       (whispering)

       Isn't that amazing ?

       ABBY

       Now, Mortimer, you behave yourself. You know very well

       there are thirteen bodies down in our cellar.

       MORTIMER

       Certainly there's thirteen bodies down in the cellar. And

       there are hundreds more up in the attic, Captain !

Teddy taps the side of his head with his finger, goes back into

his room, and closes the door. Mortimer tries to indicate by mime

that his aunts are crazy

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       What is this ?

Very quick shot of Elaine peeking behind the drapes

       MARTHA

       You mustn't mind Mortimer.

Saunders comes to his lieutenant.

       SAUNDERS

       How about it, lieutenant ?

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       I'll be right there.

He moves away.

       MARTHA

       He's been a little strange all day.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Well, right now I wouldn't know what is and what ain't

       strange anymore. I'll better have a look in that cellar.

       MORTIMER

       I'll tell you what we'll do, Captain. I'll bring my bodies

       down from the attic and you get yours down from the cellar,

       and we'll get them all together, and we'll send them to

       Happy Dale.

He sings the last words, trying again to mime to Rooney that his

two aunts are crazy.

       ABBY

       No, no, you wouldn't have to dig. The graves are all

       marked. We put flowers on them every Sunday.

Mortimer walks downstairs.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Flowers ?

       MORTIMER

       Sure, I put neon lights on mine.

He whispers to Rooney from the staircase.

       MORTIMER

       Humor them, humor them. Smile.

Rooney doesn't seem to understand what Mortimer is trying to tell

him. But Witherspoon is beginning to understand.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       What ?

       ABBY

       There's one down there, a Mister Spenalzo...

       MORTIMER

       (whispering)

       Hasn't got it yet.

He resumes his walking downstairs.

       ABBY

       ...who doesn't belong here and who's going to have to

       leave.

       MARTHA

       But the other twelve are our gentlemen.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Your gentlemen ?

       MORTIMER

       Oh, you'd like mine better. None of mine are gentlemen.

       ABBY

       You mustn't mind him at all. He got married today.

       MORTIMER

       (singing)

       There is a Happy Dale far, far away. There is a Happy"

While singing, Mortimer makes signs to Rooney and Witherspoon.

And, finally, Rooney understand what Mortimer is trying to tell

him, that his aunts are crazy.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       (nodding)

       Yeah, yeah.

       MORTIMER

       He got it. It's amazing.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       (to Witherspoon)

       Look, Super, don't you think you can find room for the

       ladies ?

       WITHERSPOON

       Just the ladies ?

He looks at Mortimer. Mortimer stops clowning, and becomes very

serious.

       MORTIMER

       Just the ladies, not me !

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       How about it, Super ?

       WITHERSPOON

       Well, of course, they'd have to be committed.

       WITHERSPOON

       Well, Teddy committed himself. Couldn't they commit

       themselves also ? All they have to do is sign the papers.

       WITHERSPOON

       Certainly.

       MARTHA

       Oh well, if we can go with Teddy, we'll sign the papers.

       Where are they ?

Witherspoon takes the papers out of the inside pocket of his coat.

       WITHERSPOON

       I have them, ladies, I have them right here.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       (to Witherspoon)

       Sign them up, will you, Super ? I want this all cleaned up.

       I'm going out to talk to that spy. Maybe I can understand

       him. Thirteen bodies down in the cellar.

Rooney, absent-mindedly, is ready to go down to the cellar, but he

checks himself and goes toward the kitchen instead.

       WITHERSPOON

       Ladies, if you will sign right here.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Elaine opens a large trapdoor opening on a stairway going down to

the cellar. She starts going down that passage.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

Einstein walks on the balcony, carrying a suitcase, and starts

going downstairs. In the room, we can guess that the two sisters

are signing the papers.

       ABBY

       (voice over)

       Right here ?

       WITHERSPOON

       (voice over)

       Yes, please. It's on the right-hand side right there.

Martha and Abby are seated at the table, signing the papers.

Witherspoon and Mortimer, standing besides them, are helping them.

       ABBY

       I'm really looking forward to going. The neighborhood here

       has changed so.

       MARTHA

       Yes. Especially since they won that old pennant thing.

       WITHERSPOON

       Oh... oh, dear, I'm so sorry. We've overlooked something.

       It's absolutely compulsory that we have the signature of a

       physician.

Einstein has reached the bottom of the stairs and he is sneaking

out through the front door.

       MORTIMER

       A doctor... Oh ! Doctor Einstein ! Come here and sign some

       papers, please.

Einstein turns around.

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Good night.

       MORTIMER

       Come here, Doctor Einstein.

       WITHERSPOON

       A doctor ?

       MORTIMER

       Oh, yes, yes. Doctor Einstein almost operated on me earlier

       this evening. Come on, Doctor.

Einstein drops his suitcase by the front door, and comes to the

table.

       MORTIMER

       Here. Just sign right here, please, Doctor.

Einstein signs the paper Mortimer gives him. Meanwhile, Rooney and

Saunders are coming out of the kitchen and crossing the room.

       ABBY

       Were you leaving, Doctor ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       Yes, please.

       MARTHA

       Oh ! Aren't you going to wait for Jonathan ?

       DOCTOR EINSTEIN

       I don't think we go to the same place.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       (speaking on the telephone)

       Hello, Mac. We picked up that guy that's wanted in Indiana.

       His accomplice's description is one on the circular, on the

       desk. Read it to me, will you ?

Einstein leaves the table, and almost bumps into Saunders, who is

brushing his uniform. He listen to the description of himself that

Rooney is repeating from his colleague at the police station.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       (still on the phone)

       Yeah... About forty... Five-foot-three... One hundred and

       forty pounds... Pop eyes... Talks with a German accent...

       Poses as a doctor... Okay, Mac. Thanks.

He puts the phone back on its hook.

Witherspoon slaps Einstein on the back, and Einstein starts

raising his arms.

       WITHERSPOON

       It's all right, Lieutenant Rooney. The doctor here has

       completed the signatures.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Oh, that's great ! Thanks, Doc. You've done Brooklyn a

       great service.

He shakes Einstein's hand and slaps his back. Einstein cannot

believe his luck. He smiles and rushes to the door.

       ABBY

       But Dr. Einstein !

Einstein picks up his suitcase, and rushes out of the door, and

closes it behind him.

       WITHERSPOON

       (to Mortimer)

       Now, Mister Witherspoon...

       MORTIMER

       No, no, you're Mister Witherspoon, I'm Mister Brewster.

       WITHERSPOON

       (laughing)

       It's contagious, yes. It's your turn.

       MORTIMER

       Now, don't play games...

       WITHERSPOON

       You sign. You sign as next of kin.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, next of kin. Why didn't you say so ? I'm all confused.

       Don't mind me.

Teddy appears on the balcony, all dressed up in his colonial

costume, but without the helmet.

       TEDDY

       Mr. Witherport.

       WITHERSPOON

       Spoon.

Mortimer picks up a spoon on the table and gives it to

Witherspoon.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, here it is.

       TEDDY

       Come up and pack my duffel.

       WITHERSPOON

       Duffel ?

       MORTIMER

       Yes, duffel. Pack his duffel. He's President, you know ?

       WITHERSPOON

       Oh !

       TEDDY

       And bring along my bugle.

Witherspoon looks on the table, where the bugle is, and then at

Mortimer. Mortimer makes a little agreement sign.

       MORTIMER

       President.

Witherspoon picks up the bugle, and starts walking upstairs. He

stops after a few steps, as if he were hesitating.

       MORTIMER

       Don't charge !

Mortimer and Witherspoon are exchanging faces. Martha and Abby are

whispering into each other's ear.

       ABBY

       Mortimer. Mortimer, we're really very worried about

       something.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, now, darling, don't be worried.

He kisses Abby.

       MARTHA

       Me too, Mortimer.

       MORTIMER

       Well, of course, darling.

He kisses Martha.

       MORTIMER

       You'll both are going to be very happy at Happy Dale, will

       you.

       MARTHA

       Oh yes, dear, we're very happy about the whole thing,

       but that's just it. We don't want anything to go wrong.

       MORTIMER

       Well, what would go wrong ?

       ABBY

       Mortimer, will they investigate those signatures ?

       MORTIMER

       Oh, no, they won't look up Dr. Einstein...

       MARTHA

       But it's not his signature, dear. It's yours.

       MORTIMER

       Mine ?

       ABBY

       You see, you signed as next of kin.

       MORTIMER

       Oh, what's wrong about that, darling ?

       ABBY

       Well... Martha, you tell him now.

       MARTHA

       Well, dear.

       MORTIMER

       What, dear ?

       MARTHA

       You're not really a Brewster.

Mortimer, who had a happy smile on his face until now, suddenly

looks very surprised.

       MORTIMER

       Huh ? What ? What ?

       ABBY

       Your mother came to us as a cook. And you were born about

       three months afterwards. And she was such a sweet woman and

       such a good cook, we didn't want to lose her. So brother

       married her. Your real father was a cook, too. He was a

       chef on a tramp steamer.

       MORTIMER

       You mean... you mean I'm not really a Brewster ?... Oh !

He almost falls backward. Both sisters catch him up.

       MARTHA

       Oh, darling ! Don't feel so badly about it.

       ABBY

       I'm sure it won't make any difference to Elaine.

He yells several whooping cries and then kisses them both very

affectionately. Then he rushes to the window, jumps into the open

window-seat, opens the drapes and yells outside.

       MORTIMER

       Elaine ! Elaine ! Where are you ? Can you hear me ? I'm not

       really a Brewster ! I'm the son of a sea cook !

We hear Elaine screaming. Elaine comes running upstairs from the

cellar.

       ELAINE

       Mortimer ! Mortimer ! Mortimer ! It's true ! It's true ! I

       saw them. Mortimer, it's true.

Rooney and Saunders come out of the kitchen.

       ELAINE

       It's true ! There are thirteen bodies down there !

Mortimer tries to make her shut up, and succeeds only by kissing

her very passionately on the mouth.

       ELAINE

       (mumbles through Mortimer's mouth)

       But I saw them

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       What's all this screaming about ?

Elaine tries to put a few words but Mortimer keeps on kissing her.

       ELAINE

       (mumbles through Mortimer's mouth)

       But I saw them...

       MORTIMER

       It's way past her bedtime.

With his mouth still pressed on her, he lifts her and carries her

across the room to the front door.

       MORTIMER

       Quiet !

       ELAINE

       But, Mortimer...

       MORTIMER

       Goodbye !

He opens the door and rushes outside. The two sisters come to the

door, waving goodbyes to him.

       ABBY

       Bye.

       MARTHA

       Goodbye, darling !

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       What is all this ?

       ABBY

       They're going on their honeymoon.

       LIEUTENANT ROONEY

       Well, they're off to a flying start.

The two sisters burst laughing and turn to the door.

BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT

Mortimer comes out of the house, still carrying Elaine with his

mouth pressed on her. O'Hara and the cab driver, who were chatting

together, jump up and look at the strange couple. Mortimer, still

carrying Elaine, moves along the house, with the cab driver

following him.

       O'HARA

       (finishing the story he was telling the cab driver)

       I pull my gun at...

       CAB DRIVER

       Hey !

       MORTIMER

       What ?

       ELAINE

       I really did see...

       CAB DRIVER

       Hey ! You'll own two cabs !

       MORTIMER

       Huh ?

       CAB DRIVER

       I mean the meter !

Elaine, eventually, comes out of her hysteria. She puts her arms

around Mortimer, and talks to him in a very sweet voice.

       ELAINE

       Oh, Mortimer.

They kiss very tenderly. The cab driver comes closer to the couple

and looks at their closed-eyes faces.

       CAB DRIVER

       (imitating Elaine's voice)

       Oh, Mortimer.

Mortimer turns to him.

       MORTIMER

       (to the cab driver)

       Oh, we're going to Niagara Falls. Call me a cab, dear.

       CAB DRIVER

       Yes, love.

The cab driver realizes his mistake and checks himself.

       CAB DRIVER

       But, Mister Brewster !

       MORTIMER

       No, no, I'm not a Brewster. I'm a son of a sea cook.

He laughs and lifts a very surprised Elaine on his shoulder, and

runs through the churchyard towards Reverend Harper's house.

       MORTIMER

       Charge !

The cab driver puts his hands to his face, then takes them away

and yells :

       CAB DRIVER

       I'm not a cabdriver. I'm a coffeepot !

With one hand on his cap, and the other hand extended on his side,

he mimes a coffeepot.

In the background, we see Mortimer entering the house, with Elaine

still on his shoulder. The cab driver drops his arms and walks

back to his taxi.
