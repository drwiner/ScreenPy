    TITLE CARD: SOME OF THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED

    OVER BLACK: APRIL 26, 1978, PLAZA HOTEL, NEW YORK

1   FADE IN:                                                        

2   INT. PLAZA HOTEL WINDOW NYC - DAY                               

    IRVING ROSENFELD, not a small man, gets dressed and

    meticulously constructs his combover. Camera WRAPS AROUND,

    see his hands with rings adjust his dark velvet suit, up to

    his face, serious, concentrated, intense, he is composing

    himself before a performance.

    Irving is now dressed, ready, and walks down the hall to

    another room.

3   SECOND PLAZA HOTEL ROOM

    Irving composes himself -- looks     

    into cramped surveillance closet, there are FBI Agents -- we

    only see their hands and arms -- he looks at monitors -- sees

    a BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE OF ANOTHER ROOM ON MONITOR: MAYOR

    CARMINE POLITO, swath of salt and pepper hair, cream suit,

    pinky ring, Rotary Club pin -- ALONG WITH CARL ELWAY, preppie

    shady businessman.

    He exhales pressure, turns as CAMERA PANS TO: SYDNEY PROSSER

    (who will also be known for some time as EDITH GREENSLY),

    stylish crafty smart. They stare at each other intensely --

    they have a deep and emotional relationship. A DOOR BANGS

    OPEN, and in walks RICHIE DIMASO, Bronx-born. He stands

    there.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               What are you doing, going behind my

               back? Telling people I'm screwing

               up this operation? I got you a

               suite at the fuckin' Plaza Hotel!

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               The shittiest suite at the Plaza

               Hotel.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               What?!

                         IRV ROSENFELD

               The shittiest fuckin' suite.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               Based on what--?

                                       2.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               And the food is wrong, and--What is

               this? You, like, went in my closet

               or something?

                         EDITH GREENSLY

               No

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               Are you dressing him like you're

               dressing me now?

                         EDITH GREENSLY

                   (shakes her head)

               No, what are you thinking? This

               isn't all about you, you know that.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               What, did you try to dress me so I

               would look like him?

                         EDITH GREENSLY

               No, you're not dressed like him,

               all right?

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               But I do, I look like him.

                         EDITH GREENSLY

               No, he's in like, velvet. Come on.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               You asked me to show you how this

               was done, you wanna fuck it up be

               my guest.

                         EDITH GREENSLY

               What is your problem?

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               Hey, look, I never laid a hand on

               her, all right? Is that what this

               is about?

                         EDITH GREENSLY

                        (British accent)

               Well technically, that's not true.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               Look, we never had sex ok? I just --

                                                            3.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

               What'd I do? I put my hand like

               this --

    Richie reaches out and puts his hand on Irving's face very

    carefully, not forcefully.

    Irving swipes it away violently the second it touches his

    face.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Don't you fucking touch me. That

          bothers me --

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Oh it does?

                     IRVING ROSENFELD

          Oh yeah.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          That bothers you?

                     IRVING ROSENFELD

          Yes.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          You know, a lot of shit bothers me

          too, but I was trying to help you.

          If I wanted to bother you, if I

          really wanted to fucking bother

          you, this is what I'd do.

    Richie takes his hand and destroys the combover Irving spent

    so much time creating. Irving just stands there, hair ruined,

    staring at Richie.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          You shouldn't have done that.

    Irving just stands there staring at Richie, hair all wild and

    messed up looking very angry.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          How's that? You bothered now? (no

          answer) Alright, don't make a thing

          of it.

                     EDITH GREENSLY

          You shouldn't touch him. He doesn't

          like that.

                                                                4.

                        RICHIE DIMASO

              Oh my god, fix his hair. Don't make

              a thing of it.

                        EDITH GREENSLY

              It takes some time, ok.

    Edith walks over to Irving who is still standing there in

    silence with his hair all over the place. She carefully

    starts helping him put it back together.

                        RICHIE DIMASO

              Big fucking deal. We got to get in

              the other room, come on. The

              mayor's in there.

                        EDITH GREENSLY

              Yes I know that.

                        RICHIE DIMASO

              Should we go to the beauty parlor?

              Is that what we should do?

    Richie walks over and opens up a briefcase that's sitting on

    the dresser. Inside are stacks of cash.

    Edith is still helping Irving put his hair back together.

                        IRVING ROSENFELD

              How's it look.

                        EDITH GREENSLY

              You look fine.

    Richie slams the briefcase shut looking very nervous and

    intense.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

              Let's go.

                                                      CUT TO:

    SUITE -- THEY WALK INTO --

                                                                5.

    DRAMATIC PUSH IN ON: THE DESTINY OF THE STORY MAYOR CARMINE

    POLITO PINKY RING, ROTARY CLUB PIN STANDS FINISHING STORY TO

    BUSINESSMAN CARL ELWAY AS IRVING, EDITH, RICHIE WAIT FOR HIM

    TO FINISH -- THEY ALL SHAKE HANDS AND SIT ON THE COUCH ACROSS

    FROM EACH OTHER. RICHIE CAREFULLY SETS THE BRIEFCASE DOWN ON

    THE GROUND NEXT TO HIS FEET. CUT TO THE SCENE AS VIEWED

    THROUGH A SURVEILLANCE MONITOR. THE DATE AND TIME STAMP

    VISIBLE.

                        CARMINE POLITO

              I thought he was going to be here.

              I do business face to face, person

              to person. That's just who I am.

    Richie reaches down and awkwardly slides the briefcase over

    to Carmine unprompted. LEAVE MONITOR'S POV AND RETURN BACK TO

    THE SCENE.

    IRV'S EYES WIDEN AS IN `NO! DON'T DO THAT!' WHILE HE AND

    RICHIE STARE AT EACH OTHER, EDITH TENSE, CARMINE LOOKS

    DISTURBED AT THE CASE COMING HIS WAY. HE STANDS ABRUPTLY.

                        CARL ELWAY

              Whoa, excuse me, excuse me. I'll

              handle that for the Mayor.

                        RICHIE DIMASO

              No, it's for the Mayor. It would be

              a sign of disrespect to the sheik

              if the mayor didn't take it

              himself. It's for you Mayor.

    Carmine looks angry and confused. He looks over to Carl.

                        CARMINE POLITO

              What are you doing? What-- (to

              Carl) Carl, what the fuck? What is

              this?

                        CARL ELWAY

              No, I'll handle it. I'm gonna take

              care of-- Everything's good. I

              got everything under control. (TO

              RICHIE) That's for me. I handle all

              that for mayor.

                        CARMINE POLITO

              What is this?

    Irving looks over and says nothing. Not surprised at all how

    badly this is all going.

                                                         6.

Edith whispers to Richie.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          (whispers to Richie)

          Just stop it, ok

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          (whispers to Edith)

          He's gotta take it himself, okay?

                    CARMINE POLITO

          I don't know what the fuck that is

          but it's weird you understand?

                    CARL ELWAY

          Misunderstanding. Misunderstanding.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          I came here to meet a sheik, that's

          all I know. I'm very interested in

          that but he's not here apparently.

          Carl?!

Carmine turns and starts to walk out of the room.

                    CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)

          I'm very interested in meeting the

          Sheik. You let me know when THAT

          could happen! Thank you, have a

          good day.

Carmine leaves the room.

Irving looks over and shrugs his shoulders. Not surprised at

all the way this is going and horrified that Richie has

ruined it.

                    CARL ELWAY

              (leaving)

          Irving! You better come get him.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

              (stares at Irv)

          Go out there and get him right now.

                    CARL ELWAY

          Help me get him back!

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Go get him. He needs to take the

          fuckin' briefcase, Irving.

                                                            7.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I didn't wanna do it in the first

          place. This is your show, YOU go

          get him.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          No, you have no choice. You have

          to go get him. Now, go get him, so

          he takes the briefcase by himself!

          That's the whole plan, Irving!

Irving stands up angry and gets in Richie's face.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          What were you doing pushing the

          fucking briefcase, dummy? Huh?

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          The whole fuckin' thing was falling

          apart. You know how much I paid

          for this goddamn hotel that you

          fucking asked for?!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Now I gotta go mop up your mess.

          I'm gonna go fucking mop up your

          mess!

Irving storms out of the hotel suite towards the Elevators to

get Carmine.

INT. PLAZA HOTEL SUITE FOYER - DAY

Irving paces back and forth as he waits for the elevator.

INT. PLAZA HOTEL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We push in on the concerned face of Sydney as Richie rambles

on to her.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          You understand what I'm saying,

          right? It wasn't working.

INT. PLAZA HOTEL SUITE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Irving continues to pace back and forth in the hall waiting

for the elevator.

                                                                8.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

               Did you ever have to find a way to

               survive and you knew your choices

               were bad?

     Irving walks over and hits the elevator button again.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               I learned how to survive when I was

               a kid.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               My father had a glass business.

     contractors march up to them.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

               I would rather be on the taking

               side than the getting taken side

               any day of the week, especially

               after I saw how my father got

               taken. I mean, seeing that scarred

               me for life.

     EXT. UNDISCLOSED STREET - DAY 1940'S

     Young Irving runs by a store front as he throws a rock

     through each window on the store, smashing them all.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               I took it upon myself to drum up

               business. I became a different kind

               of guy than my father. I became a

               con artist -- from the feet up, for

               real.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               I was gonna survive no matter what.

               I still had the glass business and

               a few dry cleaning stores on the

               side.

     Irving paces around his office smoking a cigar and talking on

     the phone. What looks to be stolen art sits on the floor all

     around him.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

               And I did some art dealing on the

               side. Stolen or forged art.

     EXT./INT. POOL PARTY - LONG ISLAND HOUSE - DAY

     Chicago's "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?" fades

     chains.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

               So, one January I go to my friends

               pool party in Long Island.

     Irving sits holding court with some friends by the pool when

     he turns and sees Sydney for the first time.

     PUSH IN ON: Irving. He looks up, they lock eyes across the

     party.

               Is that Duke Ellington on your

               bracelet?

     She does have on a Duke Ellington charm bracelet.

               As a matter of fact, it is. He died

               this year, you know.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I know. I doubt anyone else here

          Well I care. He saved my life many

          times.

Irving takes a good look at her, impressed.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Jeep's Blues. Oh yeah.

Awkward pause.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          You wanna hear it?

                       IRVING ROSENFELD

          Yeah.

                       SYDNEY PROSSER

          Sure.

Irving and Sydney nod to it - he watches her foot in her high

wedge and her tanned leg rocking as she sits on arm of sofa.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Who starts a song like that?!

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          It's magic.

                       IRVING ROSENFELD

          Magic.

              He wasn't necessarily in good

              shape, and he had this comb-over

              that was rather -- elaborate. He

              had this air about him. And he had

              this confidence that drew me to

              him. He was who he was and he

              didn't care.

                        IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

              Like me, she was a very particular

              person. Like me, she came from a

              place where her options were

              limited -- and she had been someone

              she didn't want to be in her past.

              sometimes. There's a boldness in

              it. But where would that boldness

              Like me, she learned to survive and

              reinvent herself. She knew she had

              to reinvent her life and her

              identity. And like me, she

              envisioned a better elegant future

              had to have a vision.

               She was unlike anybody I ever knew.

               She was smart. She saw through

               people in situations. And she knew

               how to live with passion and style.

               She understood Duke Ellington.

               He had a chain of dry cleaning

               stores. He asked me to come in and

               upgrade my wardrobe-- he said a lot

               of nice things got left behind by

               people and forgotten over the years-

               -

               I mean you wouldn't believe the

               shit that people leave behind here.

               Unbelievable.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER

               People leave stuff here?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               Oh yeah. They go out for the night,

               they drink, come here in the

               morning, put their clothes in and

               then they forget. They got no idea

               where they left it.

     Irving touches a hanging blue sequined dress.

Irving and Sydney continue to walk through towards the back

and enter a fur vault filled with elegant designer clothes.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I mean, some of it's been here for

          years. They're not picking it up.

          Nobody's picking it up.

racks.

               I know it's your office, but, you

               have these other places. What's

               this for? Why did you bring me

               here?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               This getting to be my main

               business, my growing business. I

               help get loans for guys that can't

               get loans. I'm their last resort.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER

               You're their last resort? Because

               interest rates are north of 12% and

               heading to 18%.

          These guys are lousy risks, you

          know? I can't get them a loan but I

          get my fee. Five thousand.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          Five thousand? You take five

          thousand and you don't give them

          anything?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          These are bad guys, you know? They

          got bad divorces, gambling habits,

          embezzling, all that shit, you know

          Everybody at the bottom crosses

          paths eventually in a pool of

                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)

               And after that...say "no" a lot

               until the guy is hooked.

     Edith and Rebecca start walking away as the businessman

     chases after them.

                                                                19.

                         BUSINESSMAN

               Becky tell her! I've never missed a

               check!

                           EDITH GREENSLY

                     (walking away)

               NO!

                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)

               It was almost scary how easy it

               could be to take money from

               desperate people.

                                                       CUT TO:

41   INT. IRV'S DINGY OFFICE - DAY                                    41

     Edith extends her hand to greet ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN, 35.

     Edith is dressed in a more sophisticated high end British

     fashion.

                         EDITH GREENSLY

               Lady Edith Greensly, it's so good

               to see you again.

                         ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN, 35

               Lady -- your ladyship -- thank you

               again.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

               These are the roles that we were

               meant to play.

42   INT. IRV'S DINGY OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY                            42

     Another desperate businessman sits across from Edith and

     Irving.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER

               We're very selective.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               You got a strong application. We'll

               talk about it.

     INT. IRV'S DINGY OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER MARK.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               I don't take a deal that I can't

               close.

                                                        20.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          You're not being aggressive enough

          in putting up your assets --

The man looks nervous --

                    NERVOUS LOAN APPLICANT

          Have you ever been to Queens? Have

          you ever been to Great Neck?

          Everybody knows my dealerships.

CONTINUOUS MONTAGE AS THEIR CLOTHING CHANGES FROM DAY TO DAY

BUT THE SETTING REMAINS THE SAME AS THEY CON MARK AFTER MARK.

A desperate man takes out a BUSINESS CHECK BOOK and writes

his check.

                    DESPERATE MAN

          Five thousand gets me fifty right?

                    ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN

          Five will get me thirty five. Is

          that right?

                    ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN, 35

          Five grand gets me fifty?

INT. IRV'S DINGY OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY

Sydney and Irving laugh and celebrate.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

          I was doing so much more business

          with her. I mean it doubled, then

          it tripled.

INT. IRV'S GLASS STORE - DAY

Sydney -- hair getting bigger -- goes over the books with a

Latino Man who nods and watches her --

Edith counts cash in the register - recounts it -- explains

how things can be done better as DRY CLEANING WORKER nods.

Irv watches happy.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

          And I never met anyone, man or

          woman, in business who was so

          careful and precise about

          everything. Every stylistic detail.

                                                              21.

     INT. BUSINESSMAN OFFICE - DAY

     Irving and Edith discuss a piece of art they're in the

     process of selling to a businessman.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

               We kept selling art together, too.

                         EDITH GREENSLY

               It's really a fabulous example of a

               genre painting, which is really

               rare for the time. It's a boy and

               his dog. Non-religious painting.

               55. Golden age. Dutch painting.

     ANOTHER DAY -- A CAR DEALERSHIP OFFICE -- IRV DROPS THE

     CANVAS BAG REVEALING A VINTAGE PAINTING -- (COLORED ORBS AND

     LINES) -- TO THE MIDDLE AGED CAR DEALER WHO OWNS THE

     WAREHOUSE WHO WRITES A CHECK.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               Paul Klee. Bauhaus Movement. 1920s.

                         MIDDLE AGED CAR DEALER

               Before we go any further, is this

               legit?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               Let's just say it's missing from

               Spain and leave it at that.

                         EDITH GREENSLY

               Don't show any Spanish friends.

     Irving and Sydney kiss passionately in front of the middle

     aged car dealer as he tries to hand them his check.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

               I mean it just took off. We got an

               elegant Manhattan office. We called

               it London Associates for her

               accent.

44   INT. NEW OFFICE LOBBY - MADISON AVENUE - DAY                   44

     A JANITOR FINISHES POLISHING SILVER PLATED LARGE LETTERS:

     LONDON ASSOCIATES to a pale wall as he and Edith sip

     champagne from flutes and offer one to the worker who toasts

     with them.

                                                               22.

     IRV DOES HIS TRADEMARK MINIMALIST BADGER DANCE, IN PROFILE,

     TO QUIET DELIGHT OF SYDNEY.

     Irv and Edith kiss gently, lovingly, sincerely on the lips --

     They walk into their CLASSIC LOOKING, STAID, PRIVATE BANKING

     OFFICE SUITE.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

               When I was around her I felt joy.

               Fucking joy! And love. That's what

               I felt.

                                                      SMASH TO:

46   EXT. PARK AVENUE - SUNNY DAY                                    46

47   They dance down Park Avenue together.                           47

     INT. LOBBY OF PIERRE HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

     Irv and Edith dance through the lobby.

49   THE PIERRE HOTEL CAFE                                           49

     As they dance among mostly older wealthy couples on the small

     dance floor of the elegant restaurant as a live jazz quartet

     plays "I've Got Your Number". Camera circles them, putting

     their foreheads together, very happy. THEY SING TO EACH

     OTHER quietly as they dance close.

50   INT. ROOM AT PIERRE HOTEL -- NIGHT                              50

     Irv and Edith make passionate love, we see in pieces --

     He gets up, she watches him dress and leave --

52   INT. IRV'S CADILLAC - NIGHT                                     52

53   He drives over the Triborough Bridge.                           53

                          IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

               As, as far as I could see, people

               were always conning each other to

               get what they wanted. We even con

               ourselves.

                                                             23.

54   INT./EXT. IRV'S CADILLAC - NIGHT                                54

55   He drives through the suburb of ranch houses and driveways      55

56   and pulls into his driveway of his split-level ranch. Irv       56

     gets out of his Cadillac and walks to the front door of his

     house --

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

               We talk ourselves into things. We

               sell ourselves things we maybe

               don't even need or want by dressing

               them up. We leave out the risk. We

               leave out the ugly truth.

57   INT. IRV'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        57

     Irv walks into the decorated ranch house, frosted glass with

     bird designs, glass tables, walls, black and brown lacquer

     everywhere. He walks into the house and looks at a picture

     his son did -- a drawing of the Yankees playing baseball --

     that is taped to the refrigerator.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

               Pay attention to that because we're

               all conning ourselves in one way or

               another just to get through life.

     Irv takes Danny's picture from the fridge and tip toes --

     with low sounds now of O.S. TV -- Irv goes to A CLOSED DOOR

     WITH YANKEE STICKERS on it --

     Irv OPENS A BEDROOM DOOR TO REVEAL HIS 5 YEAR OLD SON, DANNY.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)

               He was married, and he had a son.

58   INT. DANNY'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       58

     DANNY is on the bed, picture books, baseball cards, spread

     all around him. Irv stands holding the picture. Danny looks

     over his shoulder.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)

               He had adopted her son.

                         DANNY

               DADDY!

                                                             24.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)

               He was a really good dad and I

               respected him for that. It was a

               tough situation for everyone.

     Irv's face lights up.

                        IRVING ROSENFELD

               Danny. This is a fantastic

               picture. What did you do today?

                         DANNY

               That kid Donovan is being mean to

               me.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               The big kid? I thought Mommy picked

               you up so he couldn't bother you.

                         DANNY

               She was late, and then after we put

               out the fire, mommy said stay in my

               room with my baseball cards.

     Danny reaches across to Irving and takes his glasses off his

     face and puts them on.

                            IRVING ROSENFELD

               What fire?

                         DANNY

               Did you know they make a lamp that

               has the sun in it? [Irv looks at

               him] Mommy got the lamp. She made

               her special drink and the lamp made

               a fire.

     Irv looks concerned.

59   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    59

     Irv's wife Rosalyn sits up on the bed in a muumuu, half her

     face is burned.

                         ROSALYN ROSENFELD

               I put out the fire. The fire is

               out.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               For the first time in my life I do

               the right thing.

                                      25.

          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

Oh shut up --

          IRVING ROSENFELD

I save a young single mother, and

her kid. I marry her. I adopt him -

-

          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

You fell in love! Don't forget we

fell madly in love!

          IRVING ROSENFELD

Yes, I fell in love. My God, I

fell in love. Yes. But you know

what? I thought you were

mysterious like my mother until it

turned out that mysterious just

meant depressed, hard to reach. I

mean, I'm dying here! And you need

somebody who's gonna be quiet like

you. You're young, you're

beautiful. You gotta find somebody

else. You gotta go out and get

some friends all right? Don't sit

inside --

          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

I don't like going out. You know

that I get anxiety when I have to

meet people. You know how hard that

is.

          IRVING ROSENFELD

Yeah but you can't just stay in the

house with the fucking sun lamp.

Alright? And I can't-- I mean,

look, I can't trust you with it

anyway. That fire and everything. I

can't trust to leave you with

Danny.

          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

I put the fire out Irving! There is

no fire! Maybe if you were here

more, then there wouldn't have been

a fire in the first place.

          IRVING ROSENFELD

Oh, what, there wouldn't have been

a fire if I was here?

                                                          26.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Just stop with the whole fire

          thing. God it was a mistake. I'm

          sure a million people do that all

          the time. Those sun lamps are

          dangerous. Shouldn't even have them

          in the house, really. I bet that

          happens all the time. This was

          nothing.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          We're not happy. Alright?

Rosalyn just stares there for a moment at Irving saying

nothing.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          You know that I could take Danny.

          You know that most of your work is

          illegal. And you know that if you

          tried to divorce me, you know that--

          I'm not saying that I would, but

          I'm saying that I could. And I'm

          saying that that is why I don't

          like divorce, Irving. Women do that

          in divorces. Women get the

          children, and then the fathers

          never see them. My mother never got

          divorced. My grandmother never got

          divorced. There are NO divorces in

          my family. I am not getting a

          divorce.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Come on. What are we doing here?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          We fight and we fuck and that's

          what we do. That's our thing.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

          She was the Piccaso of passive

          aggressive karate. She was better

          than any con artist I'd ever met

          including myself. And she had me

          like nobody had me.

Rosalyn sheds her muumuu, to reveal a white leotard.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Irving, come to mama. Come on.

                                                                27.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

               You might say she was my karma for

               how I took advantage of people.

                         ROSALYN ROSENFELD

               Irving, come here. Come on. Get

               into bed.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

               Alright.

                         ROSALYN ROSENFELD

63             Baby, there's such good stuff here.                    63

     INT. DANNY'S ROOM - NIGHT

     DANNY SITS PLAYING ON THE BED WITH HIS TOYS.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

               I did not want to leave the kid

               behind. He was my son. She had me.

               I was her mark.

     INT. LONDON ASSOCIATES - DAY

     SLOW PUSH IN FROM WIDE SHOT BEHIND NEW CLIENT/MARK, FROM THE

     BACK, AS THEY SIT FACING EDITH, TO ONE SIDE, AND IRV, BEHIND

     THE DESK.

     CAMERA KEEPS PUSHING IN SLOWLY TOWARD THE BACK OF THE MARK'S

     HEAD AS HE FACES SYD AND IRV.

     WE NOW SEE THE MARK: A charismatic, mercurial, wild eyed

     BUSINESSMAN "MORT PAPIERMAN" in need of a loan.

     Mort's eyes go from her knees to her eyes -- His eyes meet

     Sydney's -- he looks soulful, open. She stares at him. Irv

     notices uncomfortably. He's JEALOUS.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               -- and every deal I take, I close.

               However, my fee is non refundable,

               just like my time.

                         MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO

                   (filling out paper work)

               I want to thank you very much

               Irving for seeing me. Sorry I'm so

               nervous.

     Richie reaches for his top button to adjust it.

                                                       28.

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

          Am I not buttoned?

Edith stares at him and smiles.

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

          I just gotta say Mr. Rosenfeld,

          that Lady Edith was very adamant

          that you were top notch and --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          That's correct.

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO

          I really need your help. I'm

          desperate. I've got the Audis for

          collateral and the two boats, and I

          forgot to mention that I have a

          little piece of real estate in Long

          Island.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          No, you didn't mention that. Two

          lunches and you never mentioned

          that.

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO

          Oh, I was gonna mention it and then

          the guy with the hat walked in.

                     EDITH GREENSLY

          The hat.

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO

          And I forgot totally. It was the

          second time we had lunch.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          You couldn't see his eyes. He had

          no eyes. It was like, did he make

          it?

                     MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO

              (laughing)

          Do they sell hats like that? Where

          do they come from? Actually, I went

          to the store that I thought maybe

          he bought it there. I was gonna get

          you one --

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          You were going to get me one?

                                                   29.

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO

          Like as a memento.

Irving decides to interject.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Two lunches?

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          Yes. It's two lunches. What's the

          big deal?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          That's unusual.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          I was trying to get him to be more

          aggressive. On his loan that is.

                    Mort PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO

          You showed me a whole new side of

          the city I'd never seen before.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          Oh, good. You're welcome.

                    Mort PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO

          No, thank you.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Yeah, right. You liked it? Should I

          take you there?

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          Yes.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Should I take you there twice?

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          Stop.

IRVING MOTIONS SYDNEY TO COME CLOSE HE WHISPERS

CONFIDENTIALLY TO HER.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

              (confidential to Edith)

          What's going on, you like this guy?

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          Yes I like this guy.

                                                           30.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Is that messing up your judgement?

          Don't be stupid.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          No, he's not messing with my

          judgment.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Hey, play your part.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          Fine. You play your part.

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO

              (holds out cashiers check)

          Take it to your people in London.

          Please, take it to them. I got the

          cashier's check right here. I give

          you five and you give me fifty

          right back, right? Please. Please

          don't reject me. Give a guy a

          chance.

MORT/RICHIE REPEATEDLY TRIES TO HAND IT TO IRV, WHO IS BUSY

STARING AT SYDNEY STARING AT MORT. MORT HOLDS THE CHECK IN

THE AIR UNCOMFORTABLY AWKWARDLY UNTIL -- almost in slow

motion --Edith takes the check -- staring at Mort. IRV STARTS

TO LEAVE -

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

          Zurich? You got an office in

          Zurich? Paris? I can call Paris?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          If you could excuse me for one

          second?

                    MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO

          Yeah, take your time. Do whatever

          you need to do. Go ahead, take your

          time.

HE HEADS TO THE REAR EXIT WHILE SYD MOVES TO ANOTHER -- IRV

OPENS THE DOOR - BAM -- A WARRANT IS HELD UP TO HIS FACE BY

STOCKY FBI AGENT SCHMIDT IN A SUIT - HE WALKS IRV BACK INTO

THE OFFICE --

AS Edith OPENS A SIDE DOOR -- BANG - FEDERAL AGENT STOCK

WALKS HER BACK INTO THE OFFICE WITH A WARRANT.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          You got the wrong office, you're

          gonna be embarrassed.

                                                                31.

     THE AGENTS START PUTTING EDITH IN CUFFS IMMEDIATELY.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

               HEY, HEY, HEY! GO EASY ON HER.

                         MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO

               I may not have you, Irving, but I

               have her on fraud. Impersonating

               another individual.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               Fraud?! Fraud? What is that?

               Identity fraud?

     AGENTS SCHMIDT AND STOCK IMMEDIATELY START TAKING BOXES OF

     FILES FROM DRAWERS, IMPOUNDING EVIDENCE.

                         MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO

               You may be from England, Edith, but

               you're not royal and you have no

               banking connections and that's a

               felony. How long is that? That's 3-

               5 years I think.

                         EDITH GREENSLY

                   (about the handcuffs)

               Hey! Not so tight!

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               Oh really? That's interesting. I

               don't even know your real name.

     Richie pulls out a badge and shoves it in Irving's face.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               Richie Dimaso, FBI. Nice to meet

               you.

     Richie looks at Edith with concern and points at Irving.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

               You gotta get away from this guy.

     Agents take boxes of files out of the office- Irv standing

     alone in center of room- shell-shocked.

64   INT. FBI HOLDING OFFICES - DAY.                                  64

     SYDNEY IS LED INTO A HOLDING CELL BY AN FBI AGENT.

                                                             32.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

               He wouldn't let me see her for

               three days. He even managed to

               delay a lawyer.

     INT. FBI HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Dim cell, lit only from small high barred window, no lights

     on. Edith looks like she's coming apart -- circles under her

     eyes, a shadow of her confident self -- pale, scared, hair

     flat, stringy, unglamourous, pacing, rocking.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

65             She couldn't handle it.                               65

66   INT. FBI HOLDING CELL - NIGHT                                   66

     FLUORESCENT LIGHTS COME ON IN THE CELL -- Edith squints. Cell

     is unlocked by Richie Dimaso WHO enters with a cup and saucer

     of tea. He stands near her with the tea.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

                   (to the other side of the

                    two-way mirror)

               Joe, how come the fluorescents are

               on? Can we kill that, please? (to

               Syd) Jesus I put this lamp here for

               you 'cause I thought it'd be better

               for you. There's a wire here.

               They're scared because people hang

               themselves but I know you're too

               smart for that. Where's the table

               and chair? There's no bed here?

               It's like a fucking asylum. Joe, is

               everybody off today? Jesus Christ

               it's scary. Maybe I wanted to scare

               you. I don't know. Maybe it was my

               idea. Maybe i'm a little off the

               beaten path you know? I don't know.

               You look dehydrated. Here, want to

               try some tea? Oh yeah, your lips

               are all chapped. (re: tea) It's

               herbal. My favorite.

     Richie bends down to Edith who is sitting on the floor in the

     corner and hands her the cup and saucer. She lifts the cup

     but her hand is shaking almost violently as she raises the

     cup to her lips.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

               I know you think -- look at me.

               Hey. Edith.

                         (MORE)

                                                        33.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

          I know you think Irv loves you. I

          know you think you know him -- that

          he sees the world as a cold, dark

          place, and he cares about nobody

          but very few people on his short

          list: his son, his father, Rosalyn,

          and you. And you think you're at

          the top of that list. But what if

          you're not. What if you're not even

          on the list at all? He'd be in

          here right now if he took the

          check.

She thinks about this. She trembles.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

          He'd be in here right now if he

          took the check. But no, you did.

          God, it's, it's so clear to me.

          It's so crazy -- it's clear to me,

          but it's not clear to you. He uses

          you, Edith, to protect himself. To

          protect his son and his wife in

          Long Island. No? Yes. He put a

          ring on her finger, he adopted her

          son. They have huge house, they

          have two cars. What does she do all

          day? I'll tell you what she does --

          she plays with her nails, she

          watches T.V., and she spends your

          money, the money that you make.

Edith stares at Richie, taking this in.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

          I don't like that you're in jail

          while he's going free. I don't

          like any of that. I want to help

          you. All the razzle-dazzle that he

          does, it's not good. It's not real.

          It's fake. It's not real. Who you

          are is who you are, between you and

          God. You and your soul. That's what

          matters. That's what counts.

          That's what I'm about. And that's

          what I see in you. Tell me you

          didn't feel it the first time we

          saw each other. Am I crazy? I don't

          think so. I'm not supposed to be

          talking like this, but I don't

          care, I break the rules.

Edith looks at Richie in silence as she thinks about what

he's saying.

                                                             34.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

               Okay, Edith? Edith. I want to help

               you. I like you. (whispers) I like

               you. (dead serious) I like you.

67   INT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY            67

     Irv stands alone on the other side of the glass staring at

     Sydney.

     Richard Dimaso walks in.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               Been in there three days. Hasn't

               been so good for her.

     Irv continues to stare at Sydney.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

               How does that make you feel her in

               there? That check was for you,

               right? But you knew somethin' was

               off. That's 'cause you're good.

               You're, like, the best at what you

               do in the whole country, aren't

               you?

     Irv looks at him.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

               But you know what? If the country

               were run by people like you, Irving

               Rosenfeld we'd be living in Eastern

               Europe or Guatemala. You ever been

               in Guatemala? You ever been in jail

               in Guatemala? You ever try to get a

               telephone or a permit or anything

               in Guatemala? That's what this

               country would be like if we let

               people, let the liars like you, run

               this country.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               Who made you god and judge?

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               My grandmother lived to be ninety-

               three years old. Never lied in her

               life.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               Congratulations.

                                                             35.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               Thank you. I'm proud of that, too.

               Does that make her not a good

               person? Is that not something to

               strive for?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

               Why you breaking my balls? Get to

               the point.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               I see something in you, Irving. I

               get very excited. I think that we

               have a lot of potential here. Now,

               look. I came up with the idea.

               It's all from me. I want to change

               things. I want to go after white

               collar crime. Irving, you're very

               skilled. And I want you to teach me

               and we can do this. I want four

               people that do what you do.

               Fraudulent investments. Fake

               certificates of deposit. Stolen

               art, fake art. You get me four

               people and you're off the hook.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               Four busts and you'll leave us

               alone? We don't have to testify?

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               You're good, you're done. Anything

               you want. But if you run, then your

               life is over. You'll be hunted, and

               it's gonna be very difficult for

               Rosalyn and your kid to live in

               this country.

68   INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT                         68

     A NICE UPPER EAST SIDE apartment. Sydney has finally changed

     her clothing from when she wore the same dress at the holding

     cell. It is quiet in the apartment - faint street noise from

     3rd Avenue below.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER

               We need to leave. We need to run

               and we need to do it now. We can go

               to Estonia or Romania, I don't

               care, we'll take the cash from the

               bed and get out of here, alright?

               We talked about it a hundred times.

                                                36.

Irv stares at her and struggles.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          What about Danny?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          What about Danny?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I adopted him! I gave him my name!

          I'm not leaving him with Rosalyn,

          she's unstable!

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          That's a manipulation! Rosalyn's

          will never let you go. She'll use

          Danny against you because she's too

          messed up to let you leave.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I can't leave him. I love him.

          Alright? He's my son.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          Richie said you would say that.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Richie? What, the cop? Your on a

          first name basis with him?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          Yes I am. I'm not even on your list

          am I?

                       IRVING ROSENFELD

          What list?

                     SYDNEY PROSSER

          Your list. Your short list. Your

          long list. I'm not even on anyone

          of your fucking lists. I thought

          you loved me. I thought we had

          something.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          We do have something. I love you,

          it's perfect! What are you saying?

          We're gonna go to Romania? We're

          gonna take Danny?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          Yes. Yes, that's what I'm saying.

          You, me, Danny.

                                                        37.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Well you never said that before.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          I'm saying it now. We're us, and we

          can make it an adventure like we

          did. We can make it an adventure

          like we make everything, alright?

          But we have to go now. We have to

          leave right now.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I can't leave Danny. I'll lose

          custody.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          You have to take me away! We have

          to leave!

              (sobbing)

          What are you saying?! Oh my god.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          What are you doing?! Please!

Sydney goes storming out of the room and down the hall of her

apartment. Irving follows.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          I can't believe this is happening.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Don't say I don't love you because

          that's bullshit!

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

              (sobbing)

          This is bullshit. You are bullshit.

          We are bullshit.

She starts sobbing, shaking.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Please don't do this.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          I just never thought you were

          conning me.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I could never con you. I love you.

          Please don't say this.

                                                        38.

Irv walks to her and bends down to join her on the floor as

she sobs.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          No, I'm done.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Don't say that.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

              (cries)

          I'm gonna do these four busts,

          these four cons, to get us out of

          this. Not just me, but us. And

          I'm gonna get really close with

          Richie, the cop, in case we need to

          use him, if we need another move.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          We don't need another move. We need

          four busts, and we're done.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          We are going to need another move,

          trust me. And you're going to be

          thanking me. (shifts to British

          accent) The key to people is what

          they believe and what they want to

          believe and I want to believe that

          we were real, and I want to believe

          that a man could want me. And I'm

          gonna take all of that heartbreak,

          and all of that sorrow, and I am

          going to use it. And I'm going to

          make Richie think that I want him,

          and that I like him, and I'm going

          to be very convincing -- And I'm

          pissed at you.

Sydney reaches over and carefully grabs Irving's face

lovingly which quickly turns into a slap as she continues on.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)

          Because I'm pissed at you!

Irving stares at Sydney with confusion. He's never seen her

like this before.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)

          Maybe I do like him -- Maybe I like

          him a lot. From the feet up right --

          baby?

Sydney gets up from the couch and storms back to her room.

                                                             39.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)

               Quite your belly aching and come up

               with something to get us out of

               this. And you're right -- I'm in no

               state to deal with this so what's

               it gonna be, Mister Mastermind?

     SOUND PRELAP:

                         RICHIE DIMASO (O.S.)

69             An Arab sheik? Why do we need an                      69

               Arab Sheik?

70   INT. ART MUSEUM - DAY                                           70

     Richie, in sharp lapeled suit, chain on his neck, walks with

     Irv and Edith and joined by a man who looks like an ARAB

     SHEIK who they trail.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               How do you think this works,

               stupid?

                         SYDNEY PROSSER

               If you could not call him `stupid'

               which he's isn't, he's smarter than

               you. Last I checked he's in control

               here and we work for him now so be

               nice.

     Richie stares at Edith elated that she just stuck up for him.

     He's really enjoying this position of power she's putting him

     in.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

                   (stares at her, upset)

               OK, to set this up and bust a con

               artist we have to make the honey

               pot to attract the bees. In order

               to attract the bees, we need to

               offer them a wealthy individual who

               can be taken advantage of, someone

               special, someone new, someone

               amazing. Then those guys will want

               to sell fake bank CDS to THAT guy,

               take the sheik's money, see?

     Richie looks at Irving uncertain.

                         SYDNEY PROSSER

               Only they can't get into his money

               unless you they know someone, and

               that someone is us.

                                                           40.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Oh that's good.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

          So if you want to get somebody like

          your con artist friend -- Carl

          Elway -- you get him to want to buy-

          -

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Keep your voice down.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          -- or sell fake art or stolen art

          or fake certificates of deposit, he

          needs -- who does he need? -- he

          needs a rich sheik guy, and there

          you go -- we can pinch him!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Right, but I don't tell Elway shit.

          I wait for him to call me. The art

          world is a small world -- and one

          of Elway's acquaintances is

          clocking us right now.

Richie starts to look around.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Where?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Don't look.

Richie looks anyway and sees ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE, a man

balding, 45 clocking them from the balcony.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          You have a good look?

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          How do you know the Sheik?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          This is my friend Al from Queens.

                    AL FROM QUEENS/SHEIK

          I do aluminum siding and roofing.

Richie stares, impressed.

                                                        41.

INT. ART MUSEUM - NEXT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Irving, Edith, Richie, and the fake Sheik admire a REMBRANDT

painting on the wall.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I want to show you something. This

          Rembrandt here? People come from

          all over the world to see this.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Yeah, he's good.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          It's a fake.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Wait, what're you talking about?

          That's impossible.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          People believe what they want to

          believe. Cause the guy who made

          this was so good that it's real to

          everybody. Now whose the master --

          the painter or the forger?

Richie's continues to stare at the REMBRANDT on the wall.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          That's a fake?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          That's the way the world works. Not

          black and white as you say.

          Extremely grey.

ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE walks up to Irving and the group and

steps into the conversation.

                    ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE

          Irving can I --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          How many times I gotta tell you.

          You can't meet the sheik, alright?

Edith sees this and steps into the conversation.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          Arthur? Hi. Edith. We've met

          before.

                                                                42.

                          EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D)

                I wanted to introduce you to Robert

                Spencer. We're advising the Sheik

                together.

      She looks at Richie. Richie offers his hand.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                    (catching up)

                Yeah, I'm Robert Spencer, advisor

                to the sheik.

70A   EXT. CHELSEA HOTEL -- ESTABLISHING - DAY                        70A

71    INT. OFFICE OF CARL ELWAY - SUCCESSFUL, BUT SHADY - DAY         71

      CARL ELWAY, 40, preppie Waspy, very old fashioned with

      cigarette holder, but something vaguely criminal about him,

      in his conservative suit, natty white and red striped shirt,

      and navy blue tie sits with Irving.

                          CARL ELWAY

                What's this I hear about a god damn

                Sheik?! Why you leaving me out of

                this? I gotta hear about it from my

                friends?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                It ain't for you Carl.

                          CARL ELWAY

                What do you mean it ain't for me?

                We gotta do certificates of

                deposit. I can print as many as you

                need.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                This is not a one man operation.

                          CARL ELWAY

                Look, I can get other guys. What

                are you talking about Irving?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                You're telling me that you can get

                four guys to sell fake certificates

                of deposit to my investor within a

                week?

      The camera zooms into Irving's shirt collar revealing a tiny

      microphone.

                                                        43.

                    CARL ELWAY

          Yes I can make that happen. Carl

          Elway can do what he says he's

          going to do.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          That's interesting but you know

          I've got other guys lined up. I've

          got a meeting with my associates.

SUDDENLY CARL ELWAY'S ASSISTANT, OPENS THE DOOR AND ENTERS.

Richie Dimaso and Edith ARE STANDING THERE -- MUCH TO IRV'S

DISMAY.

                    CARL ELWAY'S ASSISTANT

          Carl, his associates are here. He's

          got a meeting he's got to go to.

                    CARL ELWAY

          No wait. Don't go anywhere.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I've got to go.

Irving gets up to walk out as Richie and Edith stand in the

doorway.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

          Crazy thing about people -- the

          more you say no, the more they want

          in on somethin. It is so stupid.

Irving looks over at Richie and Edith.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I'll tell them, don't worry. Hey

          you know what Carl just told me? He

          said he could do this whole thing

          with four guys within a week.

                    CARL ELWAY

          Or we could do somethin' much

          bigger!

Richie jumps into the conversation.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Something bigger? My guy deals with

          hundreds of millions of dollars.

          How much bigger?

He walks over to Carl.

                                                           44.

                    CARL ELWAY

          Hundreds of million -- I knew you

          were holdin' out on me Irving!

          Hundreds of millions of dollars?

          Like much bigger. Like I'm talking

          about we say never the fuck mind

          the CD's and we could have some

          complete access to something huge.

                     RICHIE DIMASO

          Huge? Like what? (introducing

          himself) Robert Spencer, advisor to

          the Sheik.

                    CARL ELWAY

          Carl Elway.

Irv stares at Richie with contempt, then turns to Edith,

DRESSED TO THE NINES.

                    CARL ELWAY (CONT'D)

          I want you to think of the most

          undervalued asset in the state of

          New Jersey today. The rebuilding of

          Atlantic City.

Richie looks over at Irving and Sydney and mouths the word

"WOW".

                    CARL ELWAY (CONT'D)

          Look, maybe they, maybe they

          legalized gambling a year ago but

          nothing's happening.

Irving interjects.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Hey, quit while you're ahead Carl.

                    CARL ELWAY

          I know the guy. I know the right

          people who are going to help you

          out.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Whose the guy?

                    CARL ELWAY

          The guy is Carmine Polito.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Whose Carmine Polito?

                                                             45.

75   INT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY                   75

     PUSH IN: STODDARD THORSEN, Richie's FBI supervisor.

                         STODDARD THORSEN

                   (shakes his finger `no')

               Carmine Polito? Carmine Polito, no.

     We freeze frame on Stoddard as we HEAR Richie'S VO:

     AS Richie TALKS WE SEE A SHORT FILM ABOUT Carmine Polito:

     - PUSH IN: Mayor Polito walks a Camden street waves, shakes

     hands of WELL-WISHERS

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)

               My boss Stoddard proceeded to tell

               me that Carmine Polito was the most

               quietly powerful person in the

               state of New Jersey. A lifetime

               native of the very racially mixed

               Camden, which had become a ghetto,

               and where he had been Mayor for ten

               years. A very beloved guy. A guy

               who never gave up on his people.

               His father had emigrated from Italy

               and had stoked coal.

     Carmine talk to and dance joyfully with his kids and wife at

     breakfast.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)

               A big family guy with five kids.

               They even adopted some other kid.

               A black kid from the Boys and Girls

               Club who'd lost his family. I mean,

               his household was a joyous place.

               And his wife Dolly, she was the

               apple of his eye and the center of

               the household. I mean everyone

               loved this guy.

     greets a women and her baby; into his office greeted by a

     couple of AIDES who show him papers to sign.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)

               And he had a huge heart.

                                                             46.

                         CARMINE POLITO

                   (giving speech)

               The W.P.A. employed craftsmen to

               paint this during the Depression.

               Why can't we employ people today to

               do work like this in rebuilding

               Atlantic City?

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)

               He worked with all the unions. He

               was the leader of the State

               Assembly. And he had just gotten

               gambling legalized in New Jersey to

               create jobs.

     with other members of the State Assembly.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)

               But he couldn't get the funds to

               rebuild Atlantic City and that was

               his problem. So with our help, he

               was about to have his hand in the

               wrong pocket at the wrong time.

               And to me that meant corrupt

                         STODDARD THORSEN

               You said grifters and con artists.

               We're not going after some

               politician. This is a bad idea,

               Richard.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               Shhhh. Look, it's really simple.

               All you need is to put two million

               in a Chase account --

                         STODDARD THORSEN

               What?!

                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

               -- under the Sheik's name --

                         STODDARD THORSEN

               Whose two million?!

                                                  47.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Shh, just listen. Two million

          dollars under the Sheik's name, in

          a Chase account that we control.

          Carmine calls up on the telephone --

          calls the bank -- and he sees that

          the Sheik is real and he has a real

          account. Five days.

                    STODDARD THORSEN

          I'm not taking two million dollars

          of the taxpayers' money and putting

          it anywhere for five days, I don't

          care if we control it the whole

          time.

Richie as he stares at Stoddard in frustration.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Stoddard, let us do what we need to

          do to rule out corruption and to

          get rid of the payoff guys that are

          ruining this country. That's my

          dream. Don't smother it, please.

                    STODDARD THORSEN

          You know Richard, I understand your

          eagerness. I really do. You know

          I'm from Michigan, right? Let me

          tell you a story about me, and my

          dad, and my brother. We used to go

          ice fishing every November. Ice

          Fishing. That's what we lived for.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Holy shit --

                     STODDARD THORSEN

          Just listen to me. It's beautiful.

          You have a little stove. You huddle

          around, you keep each other warm.

          You drop a line and you just wait.

          One year my brother says, "let's go

          in October." He wants to go ice

          fishing in October. My dad says,

          "No, the ice is too thin." My

          brother says -- I love my brother

          he says --

                                                             48.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               I understand what's happening.

               You're saying your brother went out

               on the ice, the ice was too thin,

               he fell through the ice, he went in

               the water because he was too eager,

               and you're saying I'm too eager --

               that's what you're saying?

                         STODDARD THORSEN

               No, that's not what I'm saying.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               What are you saying?

                         STODDARD THORSEN

               We'll finish the ice fishing story

               another time, young man. For now,

               no Carmine Polito. Go do your job.

     Richie looks at him annoyed and upset.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)

               Stoddard shot the whole thing down.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               Boring.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               But Edith was a genius.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               She somehow found this woman who

               controlled the wire room. A woman

               I'd never heard of. Way back in a

               warren buried in the Bureau. This

               cat lady nobody even talked to.

               Edith met her in the ladies room

               and became friends with her. This

               lady handled all the wires and now,

               she was working with us.

     EDITH carries a basket of exotic teas;

                                                           49.

                     RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          She was excited to be included in

          an operation instead of being on

          the other end of a memo. It was

          beautiful.

Edith goes to hand her the PIMMS CUP and basket of teas.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          Brenda, hi!

                    BRENDA MCPHERSON

          Hi!

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          You said you liked exotic food, so

          that's from England.

                    BRENDA MCPHERSON

          That's from England?

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          That's right. And I brought you

          some tea as well.

                    BRENDA MCPHERSON

          Thank you so much! Nobody ever

          tells me about these operations,

          they just say, "Brenda, do the

          clerical wiring work and don't ask

          questions."

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          You need to tell Richie about your

          cats. He loves them.

                    BRENDA MCPHERSON

          Oh my cats?!

Brenda starts pointing out pictures of all her cats tacked to

the walls amidst the wire memos and paperwork.

                    BRENDA MCPHERSON (CONT'D)

          Well that's Harry -- look at him

          standing up, isn't that sweet? And

          that's Wendy. She's a rascal. But

          Barnaby, that's another story.

          Barnaby plays the piano!

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          That's impressive.

                                                             50.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               We got her to wire two million

               dollars into an F.B.I.-controlled

               account at Chase. It'd be there

               for five days and if Polito called

               he'd see that the Sheik was real.

     Edith and Richie laugh excitedly as they walk the hallways.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               By the time Stoddard caught up to

               us Edith made sure his boss was

               impressed by my idea. So before he

               even knew it was happening his boss

               was calling to congratulate him.

     PUSH IN ON CHIEF US PROSECUTOR, SPECIAL TASK FORCE, ANTHONY

     AMADO IN HIS LARGE OFFICE ON THE PHONE WITH STODDARD --

                         ANTHONY AMADO

               I'm very impressed. That was very

               smart. The Sheik with the money in

               the bank is a fantastic...don't be

               modest.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)

               Anthony Amado. He was the U.S.

               Attorney, and he had a major hard-

               on to make a name for himself. I

               mean this guy loved the idea of

               being famous. And Stoddard had to

               say it was his own idea or he'd

               look stupid in front of his boss.

     INT. STODDARD'S OFFICE --

89   PUSH IN ON STODDARD -- confused, dismayed.                    89

                         STODDARD THORSEN

               Thank you, sir, wait, the sheik --

     INT. STODDARD'S OFFICE - DAY

     He hangs up, pissed, confused.

                                                                51.

                         STODDARD THORSEN

               You made me accept praise from my

               boss who's thanking me for

               something that never shoulda

               happened! Something that I didn't

               approve!

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               You should be happy. There's

               imaginative things happening in

               this office, alright? We're not

               just working in a box.

     Richie leaves triumphant.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.) (CONT'D)

               We got the two million to put

               Carmine and the Sheik together.

     Laughing Richie and Edith walk briskly on their way out.

                         RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)

               I liked being on this side of the

               line. But someone had been left

               out.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               We succeeded because we stayed

               small. I got you Carl Elway. He

               bought stolen art, sold fake bank

               C.D.'s, that's enough. That's one.

               I get you three more -- no

               politicians.

     Richie and Edith look at him.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               You're gonna do this because you

               got no choice. You work for me.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               Now you keep changing the rules.

               You're gettin' a little power

               drunk, Richard.

                         (MORE)

                                      52.

          IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

You want to tell him, Edith? You

want to wake him up?

          EDITH GREENSLY

Oh no, I said we shouldn't do any

of it, Irving. You know I said

that. So now I support Richie.

He's got vision. Do it heavy or

don't do it.

          IRVING ROSENFELD

I mean, he's the one ruining

America, not me.

          RICHIE DIMASO

How the hell am I ruining America?

           IRVING ROSENFELD

Because people just got over

Watergate and Vietnam, alright?

And you're gonna shit all over

politicians again? And just because

you want to be a big shot and get a

promotion.

          RICHIE DIMASO

No I'm thinking big. This is gonna

be fantastic. We're doing video

surveillance. I'm doing this from

the feet up.

          IRVING ROSENFELD

You will never do it properly

because you got too much government

attitude to be small and sleek.

I'm like the fuckin' Vietcong, man.

I'm in and I'm out. I was there the

whole time -- you don't know it.

That's the fucking art of becoming

somebody who people can pin their

beliefs and their dreams on. And

you can't do it.

          RICHIE DIMASO

How about a suite at the Sheraton

Hotel?

          IRVING ROSENFELD

For Carmine Polito and rebuilding

Atlantic City?

           RICHIE DIMASO

Why not?

                                                53.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          You need a luxury hotel for the

          Sheik. Come on!

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Carmine does back door dealings all

          the time. We don't have a budget

          for that Irving!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          You gotta knock the Mayor, the

          Speaker of the State Assembly --

          you gotta knock him off of his

          fucking feet. He's gotta feel like

          he's out of his league. What you're

          offering, this deal, I mean, this

          is unheard of in the state of New

          Jersey, maybe even the whole

          fucking country. A sheik with

          hundreds of millions of dollars to

          rebuild Atlantic City -- are you

          fuckin' kidding me? That's

          gigantic. And the Mayor, he's going

          to want to see cash, he's going to

          want to see it in an account, he's

          going to want to see it right now,

          and he will check. And that's why

          this meeting isn't happening,

          because to get millions, you need

          millions.

Edith listens intently.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

              (shrugs)

          We already did it.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

              (stunned)

          What?

Irv studies Richie and Edith.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          We got the bureau to park 2 million

          account numbers.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          `We' meaning you and him?

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Yeah we did it.

                                                        54.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Really?

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          Yeah, me and that guy.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          She showed me.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          You showed him our thing? You did

          that without me? Are you kidding

          me?

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          What are you going to do?

IRVING AND RICHIE LOOK AT SYDNEY, UNCERTAIN.

IRVING SHAKES HIS HEAD IN DISGUST AND LEAVES. RICHIE STARES

AT SYDNEY SWINGING HER LEGS ON THE COUNTER AS SHE SITS.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          You playing me? Are we doing this?

          Or you playing him? It'd be very

          bad for you if you're playing me.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          You're going to have to decide for

          yourself, kid, I just laid

          everything out on the table.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          This is all very exciting, I never

          knew life could be like this.

          You're wild. You know we're taking

          down a very important politician.

Richie stands very close to Edith - between her legs as she

sits on the counter. He puts his hands on her hips, pulls

her into him. He takes her hand -- puts it on his face,

makes her feel his cheek and forehead with her hand. It is

intense. She prepares for him to kiss her but he steps back.

They are both excited. They stare at each other. The air is

thick with tension, Richie exhales and leaves.

     Carmine Polito, upset, storms down the street as Irving

     catches up.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD

                 Mr. Mayor -- Please stop. Listen, I

                 apologize if that prick offended

                 you. I really apologize.

     Carmine will not turn around -- Irving catches up.

                           CARMINE POLITO

                 Really, I'm all right, thank you.

                 I'm okay.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD

                 No. I'm fucking embarrassed to be

                 associated with that guy at all.

                 Can I just say somethin' to you,

                 please? Don't lose this opportunity

                 to fuckin' Florida -- all right? --

                 because of some bullshit from that

                 punk advisor with his diploma who

                 could never get into the school

                 that we come from. Don't lose that

                 opportunity.

          Where you from?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I'm from the Bronx. Grand

          Concourse, Hundred and Sixty-fourth

          Street.

THIS REACHES CARMINE. HE AND IRV ARE CUT FROM THE SAME CLOTH.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          I got a lot of friends that live up

          there. I go to Tomaso's on Arthur

          Avenue. You know Tomasos's?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Yeah, Tomaso's.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          The spicy clams.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Yes. They're always good.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Oh, they're to fucking die for,

          those clams. I haven't been there

          in a while. I like that place.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Carmine -- can I call you Carmine?

          You know, Carmine -- (catches his

          breath) My fuckin' heart's going

          from running down the stairs -- I'm

          not used to running. There's a

          lotta green grass in that hotel

          room up there, alright? And all the

          deals would float through you. You

          get a serious piece on both ends.

          You do with that what you will. I

          live in the real world, I am a

          family man, I got mouths to feed

          and everything. But, you know, we

          just...we gotta grease you

          directly. No middlemen, no

          bullshit. It's the Arab way.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Yeah, look, I understand. It's a

          great opportunity. It's just I got

          a little thrown by going to have a

          meeting with somebody who ended up

          not being there, so --

                                                            57.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               Hey, listen, I was thrown as well.

                         CARMINE POLITO

               I understand. I'll deal with you

               directly. I don't want any

               middleman or any of that bullshit.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               Done.

                         CARMINE POLITO

               I like you. Eye to eye. We can do

               business together.

     Irv smiles and nods as they walk back into the hotel

     together.

                         CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)

               How long do you know this guy? You

               work with this guy before?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               I gotta work with him. He's the

               Sheik's man.

                         CARMINE POLITO

               But I still need to meet the Sheik,

               okay?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               Done.

               I'm going out to dinner with

               Carmine and the wives in Camden.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               Who?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               Carmine and myself and the wives.

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               What?! Without me?!

                                      58.

          IRVING ROSENFELD

He doesn't like you, what do you

want from me, I got him to come

back and take the money and you got

him on tape alright? I can't make

him like you. I did my job.

          RICHIE DIMASO

Did you tell him you were working

with me? That I'm the Sheik's

associate?!

          IRVING ROSENFELD

I just fucking told you he doesn't

like you. I mean, let him have a

night out with a human being for

fuck's sake, he's going to jail

soon. You're done with him. You got

him on tape taking a bribe.

          RICHIE DIMASO

Carmine has got to deal with me,

Irving.

          RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

We're gonna use Carmine. We're

gonna use Carmine to get other

people, that's what we're gonna do.

          IRVING ROSENFELD

What?! Like who?!

          RICHIE DIMASO

Carmine's gonna use the Sheik to

pay off people.

          IRVING ROSENFELD

Are you fuckin' nuts? What are you

say--

          RICHIE DIMASO

We're gonna let Carmine show the

Sheik Atlantic City, how he's gonna

renovate hotels, and see who shows

up. Whoever the Sheik pays off for

licenses and casinos, that's who

we're gonna go after. We're gonna

go after all of 'em!

          IRVING ROSENFELD

More politicians? You realize how

fuckin' dangerous that is? There's

no fucking reasoning with you.

               Edith and I were so successful for

               so long because we kept it just

               small enough. You are takin' us to

               a very fucking dangerous place,

               with very serious numbers!

                         RICHIE DIMASO

               If your that successful, how come

               you wound up in this room with me?

               Taking orders from me.

                         EDITH GREENSLY

               You're taking your wife out to

               just hear you correctly?

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               That's the one thing you heard me

               say?

                         EDITH GREENSLY

               I just find it rather shocking

               that's all.

                         IRVING ROSENFELD

               I get to handle two wives with one

               dinner, alright? I take Rosalyn

               out, she keeps her mouth shut, she

               sees that my work is legitimate, I

               get to keep my kid, and I get to

               keep (pointing at Richie) that

               fucking wife happy. Both wives

               happy.

     LOCALS SHOUT TO THE MAYOR.

                                                       CUT TO:

                                                              63.

99    INT. TABLE AT BARON'S ITALIAN RESTAURANT - CAMDEN - NIGHT       99

      Ella continues. Mixture of LOCALS: ITALIANS, POLISH, BLACKS

      AND PUERTO RICANS -- wave to the mayor from the bar, and

      tables, as Irv and Rosalyn follow.

100   THEY SIT AT BOOTH --                                            100

                          CARMINE POLITO

                Rocco, you know like we do. The

                chicken very thin. You should see

                the way he does this chicken with

                the red sauce

                          DOLLY POLITO

                It's beautiful.

                         CARMINE POLITO

                Right? With the red sauce, the

                lemon--

      Dolly kisses Carmine as he gives his wife's leg a squeeze and

      kisses her cheek, then her mouth.

      Irv and Rosalyn squeeze hands on the table. SHE KNOCKS BACK A

      GLASS OF RED WINE as a plate of Chicken Picatta is served to

      the table.

                          DOLLY POLITO

                It's the Piccata of the gods!

      She pulls away awkwardly, waiter refills her glass which she

      throws back right away. Irv looks concerned.

      They all drink.

101   CUT TO - LATER: Carmine and Irving talk.                        101

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                I believe that you should treat

                people the way that you want to be

                treated.

                             CARMINE POLITO

                Right.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                Didn't Jesus say that or something?

                          CARMINE POLITO

                He may have.

                                                          64.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Also, always take a favor over

          money. I think Jesus said that as

          well.

                     CARMINE POLITO

               (laughing)

          I don't know if he said the second

          one but he may have said the first

          one.

CUT TO -- Rosalyn DRUNKENLY LEANS IN TALKING TO Dolly POLITO

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

              (shows her nails)

          I chip them moving furniture, it's

          my obsession -- Moving, re-

          decorating, it makes me feel better

          like exercise. There's this top

          coat that you can only get from

          Switzerland and I don't know what

          I'm going to do because I'm running

          out of it but I LOVE the smell of

          it.

                    DOLLY POLITO

          I can get that for you, of course.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          There's something, the topcoat,

          (sniffs nails) it's like perfumey

          but there's also something rotten?

          I know that sounds crazy, but I

          can't get enough of it.

Dolly laughs.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          No, smell it. It's true. Dolly,

          historically the best perfumes in

          the world, they're all laced with

          something nasty and foul. It's

          true!

She puts it under Irv's nose as he talks to Carmine, he

sniffs, closes his eyes, nods without even looking.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          Irving loves them. He can't get

          enough of them.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I can't get enough.

                                                           65.

                     ROSALYN ROSENFELD

              (hand out to Carmine)

          Carmine, sweet and sour. Rotten and

          delicious.

She leans across the table and puts them under Carmine's

nose.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Smells like flowers.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Flowers, but with garbage.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          You know what that is for me? It's

          coriander for me.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Irving loves it. He can't get

          enough. That's what hooks you. He

          always comes back for it.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I can't stop.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

              (confidentially to Dolly)

          He's gonna say we have to talk

          business in five, four, three, two,

          one --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

              (to girls)

          Dolly, can me and the mayor talk

          business here?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

              (falling off her seat)

          AHH-HA-HAHAAAAAAAAHHHHH!

Carmine and Dolly rush to grab Rosalyn; JULIUS, Carmine's

steadfast AIDE, BLACK, 40, BIG SIDEBURNS, LOOSENED TIE and

white shirtsleeves, BIG SMILE, helps.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          No, don't do that it makes me look

          more drunk than I am! I'm not this

          drunk. Irving please don't make me

          go, I was just starting to have

          fun!

She WOBBLES INTO ARMS OF his WIFE Dolly, she and Carmine help

guide Rosalyn out.

                                                              66.

102   EXT. WEST 54TH STREET - NIGHT                                 102

      Todd Rundgren's "I Saw the Light" plays somewhere. Edith

      dressed in tight Halston dress, hair flows huge all round

      her; walks with Richie, who is waiting in a white gray suit

      with a white disco collar outside the lapel, chains around

      his neck.

                          EDITH GREENSLY

                Didn't your fiance want to come out

                tonight?

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                Yeah, no, I don't know.

                          EDITH GREENSLY

                I'm sorry, we don't have to talk

                about it. I was just teasing you.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                Do you ever think, how did I end up

                here? How did my life become this?

                You ever think that? And you

                wonder, am I ever gonna get to a

                better place or is this it? You

                ever feel like that?

      Edith stares, nods yes.

                          EDITH GREENSLY

                I do. I definitely know that.

      Edith nods puts a hand on his face.

                          EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D)

                I'm sorry we don't have to go

                dancing. We can go have coffee or

                talk or something.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                No, I need this. Please, I need to

                go dancing with you.

      Richie reaches down and squeezes her hand.

                           RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

                Please.

103   Edith smiles.                                                 103

                          EDITH GREENSLY

                OK baby, let's go dancing.

      INT. DISCO - NIGHT

      Richie and Edith DANCE AND DANCE AND SWEAT to Donna Summer's

      "I Feel Love" -- dance -- riding a high.

      Edith EXCUSES HERSELF to go to bathroom -- breaks away

      through crowd -- leaves Richie on dance floor -- then

      SUDDENLY BREAKS AWAY -- RUSHES THROUGH THE CROWD --

104   GETS TO THE LADIES ROOM JUST AS SYDNEY DOES --   HE PUSHES HER   104

      FROM BEHIND INTO A STALL -- SHE PUTS HER HANDS   ON THE TOP OF

      THE STALL WALL AS RICHIE RUNS HIS HANDS UP HER   LEGS FROM HER

      ANKLES AND UNDER HER DRESS - SHE LEANS HER ASS   BACK INTO IT

      ARCHES HER BACK --

      SUDDENLY RICHIE STOPS, throws himself back against the other

      stall wall, out of breath. Edith LOOKS OVER HER SHOULDER --

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                I really fucking like you.

                          EDITH GREENSLY

                I like you too. I want to live,

                alright. For real. No more fake

                shit. Alright?

      She get's real close to his face, almost about to kiss.

                          EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D)

                We're going to wait until we decide

                to go for love Richie. For real.

                That's when we fuck. Not till then,

                ok?

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                OK.

                          GIRL OUTSIDE STALL (O.S.)

                Are you gonna fuck for real or get

                out of the stall for real?

                          EDITH GREENSLY

                No more fake shit.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                No more fake shit.

                          EDITH GREENSLY

                No more fake shit!

                          GIRL OUTSIDE STALL

                Fuck me I gotta piss!

      The girl outside the stall bangs on the door.

                                                              68.

      She holds his mouth in one hand and leans in and kisses him -

      they get lost --

                            EDITH GREENSLY

                Get out!

      SHE SHOVES HIM OUT OF THE STALL, LOCKS IT.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                    (outside stall)

                I want to be fucking real!

      RICHIE LAUGHS MANICALLY EXCITED AS HE STANDS AMID MANY WOMEN

      WHO SHOVE HIM OUT THE DOOR. IN THE STALL SYD SITS

      EXHILARANTLY AND THROWS HER HEAD BACK LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY -

      INT. BARON'S BACK ROOM- CAMDEN SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT - LATER

      Carmine puts down glass of bourbon as he addresses everyone

      emotionally as he looks at Irving.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                    (to Julius)

                This guy right here, Irving

                Rosenfeld? You know what he's gonna

                do? He's gonna bring the Sheik to

                Atlantic City, where we can rebuild

                all those resorts there, put

                everybody back to work.

      Irving stares and is moved by this. Tears come to his eyes,

      he feels bad about it all suddenly.

                          CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)

                He's gonna get this community --

                he's gonna get this state -- back

                on its feet where it belongs. Isn't

                that right?

                          CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)

                He's gonna grow our tax base and

                create thousands and thousands of

                jobs for everyone. You understand

                that? You know what that means?

      Carmine sits down on the couch next to Irving.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                This guy right here. He's got a big

                heart.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD

                     (quietly)

                I'd just hate it if it didn't work

                out.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                What do you mean? Of course it's

                going to work out. Guys like you

                and me? We dream and we build. We

                never give up. We never quit.

                Can I ask you a question.

                             IRVING ROSENFELD

                Sure.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                Is the sheik black?

      Irving looks flummoxed.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                He's an Arab.

      They look at each other.

                                                              70.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                That's black, isn't it?

      Irv isn't sure what to say.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                Why you asking?

                          CARMINE POLITO

                Maybe it's a dumb question, but I

                was just wondering -- I would like

                to arrange for the Sheik to see

                Camden. To see the people of

                Camden. The people I serve. The

                people I love. Who are mostly black

                and Puerto Rican. I really want him

                to see how good this is going to be

                for the community, how ready we are

                for this opportunity, and he can

                see how far his dollar will go.

                You know what I mean? What do you

                think?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                Yeah we can do that. He can see

                Camden.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                    (relieved)

                Hey, I got something I wanna give

                to you.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                For me?

                          CARMINE POLITO

                I got you a gift. Let's get out of

                here. The girls are going to kill

                us I'm sure.

                What is it?

                                                              71.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                It's a microwave. It heats up

                everything. Pasta, lasagna,

                meatballs, whatever.

                             IRVING ROSENFELD

                Really?

                          CARMINE POLITO

                It's science, yeah. That's how it

                heats up the food. It's scientific.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                And you specifically bought this

                science oven for me.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                    (Carmine stares

                     meaningfully at Irv)

                Yes. A new friend.

      Irv is touched. He sees it is a sincere gift from Carmine,

      because Carmine likes him; not cynical in any way.

                             IRVING ROSENFELD

                Thank you.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                Don't put metal in it. Come on,

                let's get out of here.

                          RICHIE DIMASO (O.S.)

                I need a jet at Teeterboro.

109   INT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY            109

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                I need a jet at Teeterboro for the

                sheik.

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                You don't need a jet. Let him walk

                to the curb at JFK.

                                                              72.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                Stoddard, that's not how it works.

                You got to do it from the feet up.

                           STODDARD THORSEN

                That doesn't mean anything. What's

                that mean?

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                It means you gotta be committed!

                It means you gotta be committed to

                something in your life, for

                Christ's sake. I want a jet at

                Teterboro for the Sheik. It can be

                a small jet. It doesn't even have

                to take off, cause I know you're so

                worried about how much money the

                Bureau's gonna fucking spend. It

                can take off and land on the

                tarmac, okay?

                           STODDARD THORSEN

                Alright, you can have a jet for an

                hour, but it takes off and lands at

                Teterboro.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                I got the jet?

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                You got the jet.

                             RICHIE DIMASO

110             Thank you.                                            110

      Richie goes to walk out of Stoddard's office but stops at the

      door.

                          RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

                So tell me the rest of the ice

                fishing story.

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                Where was I?

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                Your father woke you up, it was a

                blizzard, it was Lake Canoga. Come

                on!

                                                               73.

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                Okay, well, my brother and I were

                on the ice and my father came out

                of the house and I could see him

                coming. He was holding a lantern,

                and it was in the blizzard and I

                knew he was gonna be angry. So I

                went to intercept my father because

                I knew if he saw what my brother

                was doing he was going to kill him.

      Richie cuts him off.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                So you tried to protect your

                brother, but you couldn't and

                that's why you feel bad, because

                you're trying to protect me and

                you're worried about me. Is that

                what the story's about? About

                protection?

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                No, it's not about protection.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                It's not about protection?

                             STODDARD THORSEN

                No.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                Alright, fine.

      Richie walks out the door.

111   INT. ROSALYN'S KITCHEN - DAY                                   111

      Ros talks to herself carrying tin foil covered tray of

      lasagna.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                    (to herself)

                "Don't put metal in the science

                oven, don't put metal in the

                science oven, Rosalyn"...always

                treats me like a fucking child.

                I'll do whatever I want.

      She puts the tin foil lasagna into microwave. After a few

      moments it sparks, explodes into flames. DANNY RUNS IN.

                                                  74.

                      DANNY

                (runs in)

            Another fire!

                      ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                (grabbing a fire

                 extinguisher)

            No, Danny, not that one! That one's

            empty! We gotta use the big one!

SMASH TO:

                      IRVING ROSENFELD

            I told you not to put metal in the

            science oven. Why did you do that

            for?

                      ROSALYN ROSENFELD

            Don't make such a big deal. Just

            get another one.

                      IRVING ROSENFELD

            I don't want another one. I want

            the one that Carmine gave me.

                      ROSALYN ROSENFELD

            "I want the one Carmine gave me!"

            Carmine, Carmine, why don't you

            just marry Carmine, get a little

            gold microwave and put it on a

            chain around your neck. You want to

            be more like Carmine? Why don't you

            build something like he does,

            instead of all your empty deals

            that are just like your fucking

            science oven. You know I read that

            it takes all of the nutrition out

            of our food. It's empty, just like

            your deals. Empty, empty!

                      IRVING ROSENFELD

            That's bullshit.

                      ROSALYN ROSENFELD

            It's not bullshit. I read it in an

            article. Look, by Paul Brodeur.

                                                                75.

      SHE HANDS HIM THE MAGAZINE.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                Bring something into this house

                that's gonna take all the nutrition

                out of our food and then light our

                house on fire? Thank God for me.

      Ros stares defiantly, clicks her nails on the counter. PRE-

      LAP JET ROAR, IRVING STARES AT ROS and BURNED OVEN and looks

      at the magazine article.

112   EXT. TEETERBORO AIRPORT TARMAC, NEW JERSEY - DAY                112

      JET ROAR LANDING. A small airport. Irv stands alone, staring

      at Edith and Richie kissing. Richie, in long full length

      fleece lined suede coat, walks over towards where Carmine

      stands.

                                                         CUT TO:

113   IRV AND SYDNEY WALKING ACROSS TARMAC.                           113

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                I don't think you should come to

                Carmine's party tonight. You look

                beautiful by the way.

                          EDITH GREENSLY

                Don't look at me. Don't look at my

                legs, don't look at my hair, don't

                smell my hair, don't ask me how I

                am, don't talk to me outside of

                these roles, 'cause we're done.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                What are you doing? Get under the

                umbrella. It's just that Carmine

                wants Rosalyn to come.

                          EDITH GREENSLY

                I don't care. You weren't

                listening. I don't care if Rosalyn

                comes. Just do your job, okay?

                You're nothing to me until you're

                everything. I'm not Rosalyn. I'm

                not gonna put up with that shit.

      THEY ARRIVE AT Richie as the JET arrives on the tarmac.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                Now that's a fucking jet right?

                                                        76.

                       IRVING ROSENFELD

          It's good.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          That's the kinda moves you need to

          make.

They walk towards the Jet and walk on leaving Carmine and

Edith waiting outside.

INT. PRIVATE JET - CONTINUOUS

Irv and Richie step aboard to find FBI AGENT PACO HERNANDEZ

putting on a regal looking white Arab keffyeh headdress and

robe -- he looks noble. TWO AGENTS posing as body guards.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Paco, Richie Dimaso, good to meet

          you in person [shakes Paco's hand] -

          this is Irving Rosenfeld.

Irv nods to Paco and the other agents.

                    PACO HERNANDEZ

          Paco Hernandez. Nice to meet you.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Paco? He's--wait, he's not a real

          Arab.

                    PACO HERNANDEZ

          No. I'm Mexican. From Tuscon.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Wait, where's my guy? Where's Al

          from Queens?

                       RICHIE DIMASO

          Who?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          My friend from Queens. Where is he?

          What are you doing?

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          I gotta hire an F.B.I. guy.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          What are you-- (to Paco) You speak

          any Arabic?

                     PACO HERNANDEZ

          Yeah.   Abdullah Ahmed.

                                                        77.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          That's it? That's all you got?

                    PACO HERNANDEZ

          No, I have a couple phrases.

Irving isn't sure, looks Paco up and down.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          (to Richie) From the feet up, you

          motherfucker. What are you doing?

          (to Paco) Act normal. That's it.

          Like you can barely understand

          English. You can't speak it. You

          say as little as possible. You

          follow my lead. Alright?

                    PACO HERNANDEZ

          (to Richie) Who's running this?    I

          thought you were running it.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          I am running this but you've gotta

          listen to him. He's the guy with

          the vision.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I've got the vision? You know what

          vision I had? You just kissing my

          girl outside. That's what vision I

          had.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

              (stares at Irving)

          I thought you guys broke up. I'm

          giving you a compliment.

                    PACO HERNANDEZ

          What's going on?

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Don't worry about it.

Irving takes a expensive looking ceremonial knife out of his

jacket pocket and holds it out to Paco.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          You got a knife. This is for the

          Mayor. You've got to present it to

          him. Look me in the eye. This means

          a lot to you. Right? That knife.

                    PACO HERNANDEZ

          OK.

                                               78.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Play it. You present it.

          "Friendship for life," alright?

          You gotta feel it. Sacred. Can you

          do it?

                    PACO HERNANDEZ

          Right. Sacred.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          You gotta sell it.

                     RICHIE DIMASO

          Sell it.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          If you believe it's sacred, it's

          sacred.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Listen to what he's saying.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Can you do it?

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          It's the details. That's what

          makes this guy a genius.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Again? You compliment me again.

          What is this, rubbing salt in the

          wound?

Irving stares incredulously.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          I'm complimenting you. (to Paco)

          Any other questions?

                    PACO HERNANDEZ

          Yeah, I think the name of this

          operation is offensive.

                     RICHIE DIMASO

          What?

                    PACO HERNANDEZ

          Abscam. "Arab Scam?" It's racist.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Are you fucking kidding? What do

          you care? You're Mexican.

                                                                 79.

115   EXT. TETERBORO AIRPORT TARMAC - DAY                              115

      ELO's "10538 Overture" kicks on. Irv and Richie exit the

      plane walking slightly behind the "sheik" and his

      "bodyguards" - the sheik in the front.

      The Sheik hands the ceremonial knife to Carmine and bows his

      head --

                          CARMINE POLITO

                Hello Sheik, my friend. Welcome.

                On behalf of the great state of New

                Jersey I want to welcome you to New

                Jersey. I know that was redundant.

                I'm sorry. I'm just very nervous.

                (to "shiek")

                We have a great party planned for

                you this evening.

118   INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                             118

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                    (half dressed)

                But what are you talking about, I

                can't go? I just did my hair and

                makeup and everything!

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                The Sheik's very particular. It's

                international cultural protocol.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                International protocol? What the

                fuck are you talking about?

                    (answers phone)

                Hello -- Robert Spencer? I don't

                know a Robert Spencer. What do you

                want?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                    (takes phone)

                Give it to me.

                                                         80.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Who is that?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          (into the phone)

          Look, I told you, for God's sake, I

          told you not to call here.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          What is that about?

                    RICHIE DIMASO

              (on phone)

          Two more federal agents tonight,

          OK?

Ros leaves the room.

                       IRVING ROSENFELD

          No way.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Yes. They're bodyguards for the

          Sheik.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          That's too many people for me to

          control, no.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Look. I'm in charge here, alright?

          Just do it.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Rosalyn, get off the extension!

REVEAL ROSALYN IN KITCHEN LISTENING ON THE PHONE.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

              (hangs up)

          I'm not on it!

But she was on it. She heard.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Look, don't call here again,

          alright? Don't call at home.

                       RICHIE DIMASO

          Alright?

                                                        81.

                     IRVING ROSENFELD

          OK.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Good night.

He HANGS UP and walks into the kitchen. Rosalyn looks at him.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Federal agents?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          It's bodyguards for the visiting

          dignitary, that's all.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          What is it, an I.R.S. thing?     Like

          a tax investigation?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Why you gotta say that? I mean,

          that's why I can't invite you.

          It's too complicated. Listen, come

          on.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Are you in trouble?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Look, stop being so nosy.

Irving opens the fridge which is a mess.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          Look at this shit.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          I'm only nosy cause you never tell

          me anything.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Can we clean up this fridge? I

          mean, what are you causing trouble

          for all the time?

PHONE RINGS AGAIN.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          DO NOT ANSWER THAT--

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

              (picks up phone)

          HEL-LO- Oh, hi, Carmine. We were

          just talking about you.

                    (MORE)

                                                           82.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          Irving's being a mean, boring man

          saying that he doesn't want me to

          come tonight.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          (on phone)Tell him he's crazy!

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Well, I agree. Want to tell him

          yourself?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Gimme the phone, come on.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          It wouldn't be a party without you!

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Can you imagine? Tell him yourself.

She hands the phone to a very exasperated, anxious, Irv.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          (into telephone) Hey, Carmie.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Irving, you're crazy! Your wife is

          coming, you kidding me? She's the

          life of the party! Everybody loves

          her.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          I'm the life of the party!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

              (confidential into phone)

          Look, you know what she's like.

          She's unpredictable. She's just

          always --

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Hey, don't talk about me like that!

          What's Carmine saying?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I can't hear what he's saying.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Listen, Irving, it's very important

          that she come, you understand?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Carmine loves me.

                                                        83.

                    CARMINE POLITO

              (on phone)

          This is a really big night for us,

          you understand? Come on, you gotta

          bring your wife. And Dolly's got

          somethin' special for her.

Dolly is getting dressed for the party in the background.

                    DOLLY POLITO

          Tell her I got the nail polish for

          her.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          See? Listen!

                    DOLLY POLITO

          (raising her voice to phone) I got

          your nail polish for you, sweetie!

                    CARMINE POLITO

          You see? Somethin' special for

          you. What is it? Tell me. I mean,

          (lowers his voice, conspiratorial)

          What is it, you got a girlfriend

          coming? Come on, I thought we were

          friends. You're not gonna tell me

          you got a girlfriend? This is

          ridiculous.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          No, it's just Rosalyn's

          unpredictable.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Look, we're gonna handle this like

          men, you understand? You're

          bringing your wife. We're gonna

          have a good time. That's an order

          from the Mayor. Good-bye.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          (to Rosalyn) Alright, you happy?

          Go get ready.

Irv hangs up and exits the kitchen.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Yes, I am happy.

                                                              84.

119   INT. IRV'S CADILLAC - DUSK                                      119

      Elton John's "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" plays on the

      soundtrack as Irv drives: tinted glasses, large comb over,

      blue crushed velvet suit, dark tie -- PAN TO:

      SMASH TO:

120   EXT. GRAND OLD ATLANTIC CITY HOTEL - NIGHT                      120

      Elton John continues as Carmine LIGHTS A CIGARETTE in a two-

      toned GRAY AND BLACK TUXEDO, at the center of a haphazard red

      carpet situation in front of a has-been beach resort -- large

      old movie premiere spotlights rotate onto the facade in an

      assorted CROWD OF LOCALS some dressed up -

      JULIUS, CARMINE, TITO, MELORA (Carmine's STEADFAST AIDES)

      son DOMINIC, daughter LUCILLE, wife Dolly, assorted COPS,

      FIREMEN IN FORMAL UNIFORMS WHITE GLOVES, UNION GUYS in suits,

      fringe the area. Carmine 's family is dressed up.

      IRV'S CAR PULLS UP AND A FAT VALET IN RED OPENS DOOR. ROSALYN

      GETS OUT IN HER WHITE DRESS --

      DOLLY HANDS ROSALYN A TINY SHOPPING BAG WITH SWISS NAIL

      PRODUCTS. ROSALYN OPENS A LITTLE BOTTLE OF NAIL FINISH AND

      SHRIEKS IN ECSTACY.

      Greets everyone.

      LIMO PULLS UP: FLASHBULBS GO OFF -- SUDDENLY THE SPOT LIGHT

      JAMS WITH GRINDING SOUND, LAMP EXPLODES IN SMOKE --

      THROUGH THE SMOKE FROM THE FIRE STEPS: Richie IN A WHITE

      SUIT, Edith stunning SILVER METALLIC Halston dress, WHITE FUR

      COAT --

      THE SHEIK STEPS OUT OF HIS LIMO, IN A BLACK FORMAL ARAB

      DRESS, WITH AN ARABIC OR HISPANIC LOOKING FBI AGENT WE SAW ON

      THE PLANE DRESSED AS HIS BODY GUARD IN BLACK WITH BLACK

      SUNGLASSES.

      ACROSS THE RED CARPET -- ROSALYN AND SYDNEY SEE EACH OTHER

      FOR ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES -- LOCK EYES. ROSALYN HUGS IRV'S

      ARM --

                            ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                      (to Edith, glaring)

                  I know who you are.

                                                              85.

      Irv tries to turn Rosalyn away, but she keeps turning back

      giving Edith the hairy eyeball, as Edith gives it right back.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

                I know who that is Irving.

      Off to the side, Richie steels himself with bump of cocaine

      before walking inside the old resort, his eyes dilate.

121   INT. LOBBY OF GRAND OLD SEASIDE HOTEL - NIGHT                   121

      The entourage walks through the ornate lobby as Edith and

      Rosalyn continue to eyeball each other with Irv uncomfortably

      in the middle as Carmine ENTHUSIASTICALLY CONTINUES HIS

      PRESENTATION FOR THE SHEIK.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                So this is the lobby. Now mind you,

                a week ago this place was a mess,

                but what existed was this

                plasterwork. Look at the detail.

                This is beautiful. My sons are

                craftsmen. (to son, Dominic)

                Please, tell them what you did.

                          DOLLY POLITO

                Tell them everything you know. The

                trompe l'oeil.

                          DOMINIC POLITO

                Birds, sky, clouds, wood. Trompe

                l'oeil -- "Trick of the eye."

                          CARMINE POLITO

                We can restore all of this, you

                see? You save 50 million -- look at

                me -- fifty million right off the

                bat -- I waive the law I helped

                write. It said casino construction

                must be ground up new, we don't do

                new. We renovate.

                          DOLLY POLITO

                We don't do new. We renovate.

      Carmine leads all of them through the very crowded lobby as

      he talks.

      Irving listens intently, moved.

                                                                86.

122   INT. DOWNSTAIRS CASINO - CONTINUOUS                             122

      200 PEOPLE ARE GATHERED around blackjack, roulette, and craps

      tables, playing and having a good time.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                We put in some temporary fun --

                some gaming tables, some play money

                for people to have a good time. For

                charity -- the Boys and Girls Club

                and some arts programs.

      Rosalyn walking with Irving, continues to stare daggers at

      Edith, who stays close to Richie.

      Carmine, Julius, Melora, CONTINUE TO LEAD EVERYONE INTO

123   INT. THE OCEAN ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                               123

      Carmine continues to walk --

                          CARMINE POLITO

                This is the Ocean Room --

      He pushes open double upholstered old doors --

      THEY ENTER THE LARGE CROWDED YET INTIMATE BEMELMANS STYLE BAR

      The bar -- LIKE THE BEMELMANS BAR AT THE CARLYLE HOTEL IN

      MANHATTAN - IS LARGE YET INTIMATE -- THERE ARE 50 DRESSED UP

      CITIZENS THERE DRINKING -- AND A CROWDED LONG BAR -- AND

      ANOTHER SMALLER BAR ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM ---

      Carmine pauses to stare at the MEN AT THE FAR BAR -- FIVE MEN

      IN SUITS, 40 TO 60, SLIGHTLY MOB-LOOKING.

      AS Irv IS PULLED ASIDE CONFIDENTIALLY BY Carmine -- Richie

      AND Edith WATCH -- Rosalyn STANDS TO THE SIDE -- Carmine

      puts his arm around Irv's shoulders --

                          CARMINE POLITO

                There are some gentlemen over there

                at the bar. That's a hundred and

                thirty years sitting there --

                that's how much time's between

                them. They run the biggest casinos

                in the United States. We have to

                work with them.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                Right.

                                                        87.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          The good news is they know how it's

          done. They get it done. You don't

          have to worry. Everyone makes their

          money.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          You mean the Mob?

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Yes, but they're businessmen, okay?

          Now, spend as much or as little

          time with them as you like, but we

          do have to deal with them. All

          we've got to do is go say hello.

          We just gotta say hi, that's all.

Edith looks on, calm, as Richie -- WILD EYED WITH COCAINE AND

ADRENALINE --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Carmine, maybe -- I'm not sure

          that's such a good idea. We gotta

          confer before we talk to these

          guys.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

              (interrupting, hopped up)

          Confer? What is there to confer

          about? They're casino guys.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          They are businessmen.

                     RICHIE DIMASO

          We came all this way, Irving. We

          should be here. What's everybody

          scared of? There's nothing to be

          scared of.

Richie stares down Irv, Edith pulls Richie back -- Rosalyn is

starting to go down a SPIRAL OF DEPRESSION as she looks

increasingly uncomfortable.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

              (re: the mob guys)

          Those are the guys you're all

          scared of? Those guys over there?

          They don't scare me.

She glares at Edith and Irv and pivots to walk to the bar.

                     IRVING ROSENFELD

          Rosalyn!

                                                        88.

But she's already on her way over to the MAFIA MEN at the bar

who GREET HER WARMLY as Irv, Edith, Richie, and Carmine

watch.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          I love this!

Rosalyn walks up to PETE MUSANE, CHARISMATIC, 30 and sits

down in between all the Mafia guys.. THE OTHER THREE SALT AND

PEPPER MAFIA GUYS LAUGH AND TALK WITH Rosalyn - who gulps a

glass of PROSECCO and IS REFILLED BY PETE MUSANE.

                     ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Hi.   Can I sit here?

Carmine whispers to Irv as he watches Rosalyn talk to the

Mafia guys.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Irving, this is not a good idea.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          How you guys doing? Everybody over

          there is really scared of you guys,

          you know that?

She knocks back the prosecco. She seems relieved.

Dolly ushers her kids to the door.

                    DOLLY POLITO

          Kids, I want you to go up and get

          some pizza and soda, please.

Irving and Edith watch in horror at Rosalyn.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          It's a disaster.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          I think they have this room all

          wrong.

                    PETE MUSANE

          Yeah? What would you do?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          I would do it in all black and gold

          and I would do this bar like a big,

          warm golden mirror.

                    DICK HELSING

          Sounds beautiful.

                                                          89.

                       ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Thank you.

Rosalyn's smitten by the mobsters.

                    PETE MUSANE

          But you expect that from her

          because she's so beautiful --

                       ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Oh stop.

                       DICK HELSING

          Gorgeous.

                    PETE MUSANE

          I love her hair, so I know I'm

          gonna love how she'd do the room --

He touches the front of her huge Farrah overhang bangs.

Richie, Irving, Carmine, and the Sheik walk up to them.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          How do you do?

                    PETE MUSANE

              (to Richie)

          I'm sorry is she your wife?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          No, she's my wife. She's my wife.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Look at these fine gentleman.

                    PETE MUSANE

          Carmine, there you are.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          How you doing?

Irving takes the glass of prosecco out of Rosalyn's hand and

puts it on table.

                    PETE MUSANE AND GUYS

          Ohhhh, heyyyyy! Come onnn!

                    ROSALYN

          It's because he's a party pooper.

          He's so boring.

Irving stares fuming at Rosalyn and the guys, he nods and

forces a smile good naturedly as they put prosecco glass in

his hand. He knows how to fake it.

                                                           90.

                    PETE MUSANE

          You have a very beautiful wife.

                    DICK HELSING, ROSALYN ROSENFELD, OTHER

                    GUYS

          Salud.

THE MADE GUYS LAUGH. SYD ROLLS HER EYES. IRVING, CARMINE

STARE WITH TENSION.

THEY ALL LAUGH. RICHIE GUIDES SHEIK with ONE BODY GUARD.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          May I present Sheik Abdullah,

          gentlemen, from Abu Dhabi. Sheik,

          these men are professionals, they

          run the best casinos in the United

          States.

The Sheik acknowledges them with a nod. Irv is extremely

uncomfortable.

                    PETE MUSANE

          Mr. Sheik, as a sign of our

          seriousness, Mr. Tallegio came from

          Miami to meet you tonight.

HEAVY PAUSE.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Mr. Tallegio? Why didn't you tell

          me Mr. Tallegio was here?

                    PETE MUSANE

          He's in the back room.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          It's a sign of disrespect to do

          business on the first meeting.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          That's not true. I don't know what

          your talking about. (to Musane)

          He's got it all wrong.

                    DICK HELSING

          Well, don't leave him back there in

          the back room waiting. Come on,

          let's go.

Rosalyn reaches to have her glass refilled by Dick Helsing

when one of the other guys NUDGES her hip in her tight dress

and she drops into Pete Musane's lap.

                                                               91.

                           ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                 Hey Irving, I'm going to be having

                 fun. Maybe it will be contagious.

       Irving turns and heads with dread towards the back door with

       Carmine, Richie, and the Sheik. Sydney, worried about Rosalyn

       with Musane, decides to hang back.

125    INT. CASINO BACK ROOM -- NIGHT                                  125

       LIGHT GRAY SUIT, DARK TIE -- STANDING BY HIMSELF.

       CARMINE, RICHIE, SHEIK, IRVING ENTER A HALF FINISHED BACK

       ROOM. PUSH IN ON IRVING.

                             VICTOR TELLEGIO

                 Carmine!

                           IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

                 Victor Tellegio was from Miami. He

                 was Meyer Lansky's right-hand man.

                 In his prior reputation as an

                 enforcer from twenty years ago, he

                 was known to never bury a body

                 because he felt it sent a stronger

                 message to leave it in the street.

                                                  FLASH BACK TO:

125A   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                             125A

       YOUNGER TELLEGIO WALKS LAUGHING WITH A COLLEAGUE, LETS

       COLLEAGUE GET AHEAD AND TELLEGIO SUDDENLY PULLS PISTOL, FIRES

       THREE BULLETS WITH MUZZLE FLASH INTO MAN'S HEAD, MAN GOES TO

       GROUND, TELLEGIO FIRES ONCE MORE, DROPS CLIP FROM GUN AND

       SPITS ON BODY, WALKS DIRECTLY TO CAMERA MENACING. NOW BACK

       TO:

                           IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

                 This is the guy we now had to deal

                 with.

125B   INT. CASINO BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                              125B

       RESUME PUSH IN ON TELLEGIO AS A COUPLE OF BUSBOYS SET UP AN

       IMPROMPTU TABLE AND CHAIRS. Carmine greets him.

                                                        92.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          You sure you don't want to go into

          the Ocean Bar? It's really, it's

          beautiful in there.

                    VICTOR   TELLEGIO

          I'm very happy I   don't have to go

          there. I like it   here. There's an

          exit. I'm like a   ghost. Nobody

          knows I'm here.

Busboys whip open a white table cloth for the table.

Everyone sits down. Tellegio looks at the Sheik, then over to

Richie.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)

          Tell him I speak for our friends in

          Florida. We're very excited. It's

          been our lifelong dream to build

          casino resorts on the East Coast.

Richie pretends to translate in the Sheik's ear.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)

          You told him that? They didn't want

          the Jews to make money, they didn't

          want the Italians to make money,

          definitely don't want the blacks to

          make money. After the oil embargo --

          the gasoline crisis -- the

          hijackings, the Olympics, they

          don't want to see Arabs make money,

          trust me, not on our soil. You can

          tell him this in your own way: I've

          been in the casino business forty

          years. It's scrutinized more

          carefully than any other business.

          Carmine made this legal, but we

          must be careful or they'll take it

          away.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          So, Mister Tellegio, how do you

          think we should approach this? What

          do you want to do?

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO

          If you want to get the gaming

          license and keep it we have to make

          our principal investor here, the

          Sheik, an American citizen.

                                                           93.

Irving and Richie both look at Victor intensely not sure

where this is going.

                     CARMINE POLITO

          To expedite citizenship -- well,

          that requires very special

          treatment.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO

          You would know the right people to

          do that, Carmine.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Carmine knows everybody.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          What are we talking about?

                    CARMINE POLITO

          U.S. Senators. Congressmen.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Wow, that's fantastic.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I say stay away from that. That's

          bad. That's trouble. No, that's not

          good.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Irving please.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          That's trouble.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO

          Who is this guy? (to Irving) What

          are you, a farmer?

Richie and Tellegio both laugh.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Mr. Tellegio, I'm sorry, this is

          Irving. New York businessman.

          Irving Rosenfeld.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO

          Irving, Irving. What's the matter,

          Irving? What's the problem?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Nothing. No problem.

                                                        94.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO

          Don't get your balls in an uproar.

          Everything's fine, everything's

          good. It's all good. It's all good.

          I just hope the other part of this

          is all good. And real. Because

          we're real. You know that. You deal

          with us. We're a real organization.

          We deal with you, we don't know

          what we're dealing with.

Everyone stares increasingly tense at Tellegio in silence.

This could go wrong at any minute. Tellegio looks over to

Richie and points to the Sheik.

Irving watches in horror as --

                    VICTOR TALLEGIO

          Where's he from?

                     RICHIE DIMASO

              (winging it)

          Abu Dhabi.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO

          Oh, he's from the Emirates.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Yeah.

                     VICTOR TELLEGIO

              (in subtitled Arabic)

          (Can I count on you? You gotta be

          honest about this. Do you

          understand me? Good means good. No

          bullshit.)

PUSH IN ON IRV AND CARMINE FEELING THIS IMMENSE PRESSURE.

WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?

                     VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)

          (to Sheik)

          (Did you hear what I said? Do you

          want me to repeat it?)

Irving looks ill, as does everyone else at the table.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)

          (What do you think now? Tell me.

          Tell me.)

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Uh, I think, I think what he's --

                                                        95.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO

          No, let him speak for himself.

Sheik swallows hard and looks to Richie. It's a very tense

moment for everyone at the table.

Tellegio stares. Everyone hangs on this. Irving and Richie

share a look -- what is he doing?

A DRUNK, AL KOWALSKI, a working man, friend of the Mayor

BARRELS INTO INTO THE TABLE, spilling drinks. Tellegio's guys

jump in and grab him and start to pull him away.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          No, I know him.

                    AL KOWALSKI

          You guys are way too serious for a

          party!(to Tellegio) Hey, what are

          you drinking? You got a drink?

TELLEGIO GLARES BACK AT THE INTRUSION.

                    CARMINE

              (to Al)

          We're in a very serious meeting.

          (to Tellegio) I apologize.

TELLEGIO DOES NOT LOOK AMUSED.

                    AL KALOWSKI

          I understand, you're in conference.

          You gotta come with me now. You got

          a speech to give. Everyone's

          waiting for you.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Al, I'll be right behind you, okay?

          Trust me.

Paco Hernandez/Sheik stands up and reaches over to Tellegio

to shake his hand. Irving panics. THE MENACING DEEP BASS

INTRO OF "WHITE RABBIT" FADES UP ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

                    SHEIK ABDULLAH

              (In Arabic)

          It is great doing business with

          you. The investment is real. It was

          a pleasure to meet you.

Irving exhales in relief that Paco managed to say anything

passable in Arabic.

                                                        96.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

          What are the odds of an Italian guy

          from Miami knowing Arabic? But it

          turns out he's got casino

          investments in the Mideast and he

          spent two years learning it to keep

          the upper hand.

Victor leans over to talk to Carmine.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO

          Listen to me carefully. If you're

          real, you put ten million in the

          bank of our choice in the next two

          weeks.

Carmine nods.

                    VICTOR TELLEGIO (CONT'D)

          Carmine, listen to me carefully, if

          you're real, you put ten million in

          the bank of our choice in the next

          two weeks or not only will the

          Sheik feel insulted, but our

          friends in Florida will feel deeply

          disrespected and so will I.

Irving looks at Victor, who stares back at him. This is bad.

AT THE BAR --

"WHITE RABBIT" CONTINUES. ROSALYN CONTINUES TO FLIRT WITH

PETE MUSANE --

SYDNEY WATCHES OUT OF CONTROL ROSALYN, STANDS AND WALKS OVER

TO HER.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          Rosalyn, you need to come with me

          alright?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          I don't need to come with you.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          You need to come with me. This

          needs to stop. Come on.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Oh, you think I should come with

          you?

                                                        97.

                     EDITH GREENSLY

          Yeah, you need to come with me

          right now.

Rosalyn takes her wrist out of Sydney's grasp.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Why don't you get your fucking

          hands off me, you fucking whore!

                    PETE MUSANE

          Hey!

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          You're a whore. (to everyone) This

          is my husband's whore!

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          That's real nice.

                    DOLLY POLITO

          We're not going to do this in the

          Ocean Room tonight. Not tonight.

          Please.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          This is my husbands whore!

Dolly escorts Edith over to one side of the room away from

Rosalyn.

                    DOLLY POLITO

          You stay over here with me.

          Everybody just calm down. I don't

          know what's going on.

Pete looks over to Rosalyn.

                    PETE MUSANE

          You alright? Take it easy. These

          things happen. Whatever's meant to

          be will be.

Rosalyn smiles at Pete.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          That's what I always say.

                    PETE MUSANE

          You say that?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Yeah.

                                                              98.

                          PETE MUSANE

                See? Kindred spirits.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                Whatever's meant to be will be.

                          PETE MUSANE

                Whatever's meant to be will be.

                                                        CUT TO:

      INT. WOMEN'S POWDER ROOM HALLWAY - CASINO

      ROSALYN STORMS DOWN THE HALL TOWARDS THE BATHROOM AS "WHITE

      RABBIT" BUILDS TO ITS CLIMAX.

126   INT. WOMEN'S POWDER ROOM - CASINO                             126

      Rosalyn looks in mirror: sadness, anger, fear. Edith rushes

      in.

                          EDITH GREENSLY

                What the hell do you think you're

                doing?

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                What the hell do I think I'm

                doing?! What the fuck do you think

                you're doing? You really gonna come

                in here and judge me for flirting

                with somebody after you've been

                fucking my husband for how many

                years?!

                          EDITH GREENSLY

                You don't have any fucking clue

                what's going on!

      Rosalyn holds her hand, with wedding ring to Sydney's face.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                I got a ring on my finger. We have

                a child together.

                          EDITH GREENSLY

                He doesn't love you Rosalyn he

                loves me. And you know it and I

                know it and he knows it. And it

                might be done now, but it was

                beautiful and it was real.

                                                        99.

                     ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Stop.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          And we loved each other.

                     ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Shut up.

Rosalyn starts to tear up.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          You scare him, and you manipulate

          him, and you use your son!

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Well, he must like it on some

          level. He must want it because he

          keeps coming back for it. It's like

          that perfume that you love that you

          can't stop smelling, even when

          there's something sour in it. You

          can't get enough of it. But guess

          what, he's never gonna leave me.

          He's always going to want me, and I

          will make you so sorry, Edith. I

          will make you so sorry for what

          you've done to my family, mark my

          words.

                     EDITH GREENSLY

          That is fucked up! I would never

          say anything that fucked up to

          anybody, but you do because you're

          gross inside, you're so fucked up

          and gross.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Oh, I'm gross inside?

                     EDITH GREENSLY

          Yeah.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Maybe you're gross inside, with

          robbing people and all that shit

          that you do? Maybe we're both gross

          inside, that's what Irving loves

          about us. At least he's consistent

          with his women. You know, sometimes

          in life all you have are fucked up,

          poisonous choices.

Rosalyn reaches over, grabs Sydney's face and kisses her.

                                                               100.

      Rosalyn laughs a toxic, tough front dark laugh and walks out.

      THE BEE GEES "HOW CAN YOU MEND A BROKEN HEART?" STARTS.

      Sydney looks into the mirror and wipes the lipstick off her

      lips as Rosalyn storms out of the powder room.

                                                      SMASH TO:

129   ROSALYN WALKS OUT SHAKY -- SUDDENLY FROM BEHIND A ROW OF      129

      WOODEN PAYPHONES A HAND GRABS ROSALYN'S AND PULLS HER BEHIND

      THEM - ITS PETE MUSANE - THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER - SILENT -

      INTENSE-- ROSALYN IS SHAKING AND CRYING AS SHE FALLS APART IN

      HIS ARMS.

      SYDNEY COMES STORMING OUT OF THE POWDER ROOM AND WALKS RIGHT

      PAST ROSALYN AND PETE.

      PUSH IN ON: SYDNEY LOOKING BACK, STOPPED, SEES ROSALYN

      EMBRACING PETE AS SHE CRIES.

                                                      SMASH TO:

130   SYDNEY RUNS INTO BACK ROOM, URGENTLY JOINS IRV AND RICHIE AT    130

      THE TABLE.

                          EDITH GREENSLY

                We need to talk! This is serious.

                                                      SMASH TO:

      CARMINE AND DOLLY CLIMB THE STAIRS TO THE MAIN BALLROOM

      FILLED EXCITEDLY WITH OPTIMISM AS THE SONG SWELLS. THEY KISS

      IN SILHOUETTE INTO A HARD BACKLIGHT. CARMINE CLIMBS REACHES

      THE STAGE AND THE CROWD ROARS.

                          AL KALOWSKI

                Ladies and gentlemen, your friend,

                the working man's friend, my

                friend, Mayor Carmine Polito!

      ON STAGE: Carmine TAKES MIC

      Irving stands off to the side of the stage as his world

      closes in around him. Pulls his heart pills out of his pocket

      and takes one. Sydney sees this as she stands nearby with

      Richie.

      Irv, Edith, Richie watch near stage, jostled. Rosalyn enters

      the ball room looking disheveled as she is guided by Pete

      Musane looks to stage.

                                                              101.

                           CARMINE POLITO

                    (on mic)

                Hello, Camden! Hello, New Jersey!

                wanna WORK AND LIVE. (crowd CHEERS)

                There's no money nowhere. You gotta

                be kidding me! -- don't they

                remember who built this country?

                [CHEERS] The one thing we can all

                agree about in the State of New

                Jersey is that we never, ever give

                up! Do we?

      Carmine dominates the crowd and you can see the emotion in

      his face as he says this. He raises his glass to the crowd.

                           CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)

                Please, raise a glass with me to a

                new era that begins tonight. From

                me and my family, we thank you. For

132   INT. IRVING'S DRY CLEANERS - EARLY MORNING                     132

      Irving walks in with his keys, same clothes from night

      before, as ocean sounds continue, TAKES A GUN FROM THE SAFE,

      and he stands looking lost and lonely, he turns on the

      electric dry cleaning rack, where he and SYDNEY STOOD

      TOGETHER, IN LOVE. He looks heartsick. HE STEPS INSIDE THE

      SWIRLING ELECTRIC DRY CLEANING RACK OF PLASTIC WRAPPED

      CLOTHES, AND STANDS ALONE, WHERE SYD USED TO BE, AND IS

      HEARTBROKEN.

      EXT. THIRD AVENUE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

                Last night was insane. I got it all

                That's a whole floor of the hotel.

                Richard. It's not your operation.

                And I'm not giving you a whole

      INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

                           RICHIE DIMASO

                I have members of Congress that are

                gonna come in right now to try to

                give the Sheik citizenship. They're

                taking bribes. This is happening

                right now.

          out of your fucking mind?

INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Tellegio is? Victor. Tellegio.

          Works for Meyer Lansky. You know

                    STODDARD THORSEN

          I know who Victor Tellegio is.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Resorts International! He wants ten

          million dollars. I have two weeks!

                    STODDARD THORSEN

          You're not getting ten million

          dollars.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

              (screaming)

          Just listen to me! You're not

          listening to me! I have two weeks!

          I have two weeks to put this thing

                    STODDARD THORSEN

          Lower your voice. You don't get to

          yell at me.

Richie SLAMS DOWN THE PHONE. Edith (HAIR IN CURLERS) STARES

AT HIM.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Calm me down baby. You gotta calm

          me down.

He handles her hips and neck and waist and ass.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

          Baby let's do this. Let's do this

          right now. --

                                                       104.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          No, no.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          I want to do this. You're fucking

          skin is glowing baby. Your skin is

          glowing.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          I'm not doing this with you. We're

          not going to do this unless we do

          it for real, alright?

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          I want to do this now!

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          That's what we agreed on so we're

          not going to do that alright?

          Alright? Where are you? You're

          acting all scary.

She grabs him by the head to calm him down.

                    EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D)

          Are you here with me?

HE TRIES A GENTLER SEDUCTION.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

              (leans down to her eyes)

          I love you. I love you. Look at me.

              (slowly)

          I'm in love with you. It is real

          now. I just said it so now's the

          time.

He handles her, nuzzles her neck, starts to turn her on.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

              (kissing him)

          You want the truth? You want real?

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          I'm ready for real.

SOMETHING CLICKS INSIDE HER -- SHE DROPS HER BRITISH ACCENT --

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

              (DROPS HER BRITISH ACCENT)

          OK, this is real. Do you hear my

          voice? This is real. This is real.

          What you hear is real.

                                                       105.

Richie steps back quickly and grabs Sydney.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          What?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          This is me.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          What do you mean? What are you

          doing an accent? An American

          accent?

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          No. There is no English. There's

          only American. There is no English.

Richie looks at her and continues to hold her looking very

confused and flustered.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          What are you talking about? Stop

          it. You're Edith. You're Edith

          Greensly. I checked your records.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          I falsified my records back to

          birth. I falsified them.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)

          My name is Sydney Prosser, and I'm

          from Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm

          not Edith Greensly. There is no

          Edith Greensly.

Richie steps back. He stares at her darkly.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          You're -- freaking -- me -- out.

          No, you said in the stall that we

          were going to be real and that we

          weren't going to fake it.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          I'm being real now. This is who I

          am. I'm Sydney Prosser. Ok?

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          So -- why -- did you do an English

          accent after that?

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          I'm sorry I didn't tell you in the

          stall.

                    (MORE)

                                                       106.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)

          I created Edith because I needed

          her to survive, okay? But I'm done

          with that now. I'm so fucking done

          with that. Like you do what you

          need to survive, right? You do it.

          You know, you live with your mom --

          you have a fiancee you don't even

          acknowledge, right? That's what

          you do. And you curl your hair in

          little fucking curlers, which is --

          No, it's okay, you look good with

          it, but you know -- you have

          straight hair, so that's what you

          do to survive. You do all sorts of

          things, you know. We all do.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

              (whispers tensely)

          Please don't talk about that. I'm

          confused. I'm confused and --

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          I'm fucking confused too, alright?

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          -- I think we should fuck, and then

          we'll feel it and we won't be

          confused anymore.

HE EMBRACES HER --

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          No -- I want to talk. I don't want

          to fuck.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

              (embracing her)

          Yes! Come on.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          NO! I'm not fucking you. I'm not

          fucking fucking you!

RED FACED LIKE HE MAY HIT HER, a vein stands out in his neck.

SHE FLINCHES. HE SCREAMS like an animal in confusion and

frustration.

                     RICHIE DIMASO

          AHHH!

SUDDENLY SYDNEY GRABS A GLASS PICTURE FRAME FROM A TABLE,

SMASHES IT ACROSS RICHIE'S FOREHEAD AND FACE WITH A

SHATTERING OF GLASS.

                                                       107.

Richie in pain holds his cut forehead and eyebrow.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

              (in pain and dismay)

          SHIT!

They hear a door open off screen, someone approaches. Irving

appears from around the corner of the wall pointing his

handgun at Richie.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Will you please step away from

          Edith. I'm asking you nicely please

          step away from Edith right now.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          What the fuck --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Step away from her. Please.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          You mean Sydney?

Irving looks over to Sydney very confused.

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          I told him. I'm sorry. I just don't

          give a fuck anymore, I don't give a

          fuck. I don't fucking care.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Irving has a gun.

                     IRVING ROSENFELD

          What Richie's gotten us into is

          worse then jail. I told you last

          night, don't sit down with those

          goons. And what? Now what? No one's

          getting ten million for Tellegio.

          It's over.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          I don't think so.

Irving and Sydney stare.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

              (slowly)

          Because when Tellegio finds out

          what happened, do you think he's

          gonna go after me? I don't think

          so. Someone from the Bureau?

                    (MORE)

                                                       108.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

          Think he's gonna go after a

          politician? He's gonna kill you.

          Then he's going to go after your

          son. And Sydney.

Richie PICKS UP PHONE AS THEY WATCH -- HE DIALS. INTERCUT:

                    STODDARD THORSEN

              (on phone)

          Stoddard Thorsen.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

              (slowly, intensely)

          You're going to give me the Sherman

          Suite. The whole floor.

HIS NOSE AND FOREHEAD ARE CUT FROM THE GLASS.

                    STODDARD THORSEN

          That's a NO. I said no wacko.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          And you're going to tell me the

          point of that FUCKING fishing

          story.

                    STODDARD THORSEN

          Not the way you're behaving.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

              (FUMING)

          What's the matter with you? Where

          are you right now?

                    STODDARD THORSEN

          What does that make a difference?

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Just tell me where the fuck you

          are.

                    STODDARD THORSEN

          The field office on 61st street.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          I'm coming to 61st Street. Right

          now.

                    STODDARD THORSEN

          You're going to do what?

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          To beat -- your ass.

                                                               109.

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                You're going to what?

      Richie SLAMS the phone down, storms out the apartment.

140   INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                   140

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                You were right. We should have gone

                away.

      Irving sits in the corner of the room a disheveled mess.

      Sydney sits on the bed drinking a Fresca.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

                I should have gone away with you.

                          SYDNEY PROSSER

                We were supposed to do it from the

                feet up like you always said.

                That's how we were meant to do it

                but you didn't do it like that. You

                didn't do it like that. You played

                it safe so there was always a

                danger you were going to end up

                with Rosalyn in the dead space,

                floating on some dead spaceship

                with the furniture and the

                curtains. And I was your life line

                out and you were mine and that was

                ok.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                    (Irving stares at her,

                     emotional)

                I wish I could get you back.

      He walks across the room and sits down on the bed next to

      Sydney.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

                You know I can't do it without you.

                You know that. Come on. Me, you

                and Danny. Like we said.

                          SYDNEY PROSSER

                Like I said. You never said that. I

                said that. We gotta get over on all

                these guys. That's what we need to

                be thinking about right now.

      Irving takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes.

                                                               110.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                That's big. That's crazy. Whatever

                it is, it's got to be the best

                we've ever done.

      Sydney nods her head yes, stares intensely at Irving as the

      camera tilts down to reveal: their hands clasped together.

141   EXT. OLD FEDERAL BUILDING - DOWNTOWN - DAY                        141

      High ceiling, old office. Close on a tape recorder.

      AS CAMERA PULLS BACK - SEE   STODDARD, BANDAGES ON HIS BRUISED

      FACE AND A WHITE EYE PATCH   ON HIS INJURED EYE, SITTING

      OPPOSITE PROSECUTOR, AMADO   - - the tape recorder and

      microphone sit on the desk   in front of Stoddard as he records

      a statement for a report.

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                    (SLOW MIDWEST MONOTONE)

                Agent Dimaso called me late at

                night on the 21st. I believe that

                he was intoxicated. He threatened

                me and I told him this was

                inappropriate. I told him

                procedures exist for reasons we

                must respect. This is the third

                such call I received from Agent

                Dimaso. He called me again the

                night of the 5th and he threatened

                to kill me. Subsequently he

                demanded that I allow him to use

                the Sherman Suite at the Plaza

                hotel for purposes of bribing

                members of congress.

      Camera pull-back reveals: THE CHASTENED Richie SITS

      LISTENING, IN A SUIT AND TIE. He's in trouble with their

      boss, the prosecutor.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                I am so sorry.

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                I'm not finished. There's a lot

                more.

      Richie gets up and pulls up a chair next to Stoddard.

      Stoddard flinches and moves away like he's going to get hit

      again.

                                                             111.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                I have nothing but the utmost

                respect for you as my mentor. (he

                reaches down and turns the tape

                recorder off) and as my --

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                    (re: the recorder)

                What are you doing?

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                I just want to talk from my heart.

                I don't want it on record. I want

                to get vulnerable.

                           STODDARD THORSEN

                Can I finish? Can I finish my

                statement?

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                Of course. I respect you.

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                I think you do other things besides

                respect me.

                                                      SMASH TO:

139   INT. STODDARD'S FIELD OFFICE - FLASHBACK                       139

      Stoddard paces while on the phone, holds up a finger to

      Richie to wait, Richie picks up Stoddard's phone -- rips the

      cord out and smashes Stoddard across the face with the base.

      Doesn't stop til Stoddard falls to the ground, knocks over

      desk chair and bookcase behind.

                                                       BACK TO:

      INT. OLD FEDERAL BUILDING - DOWN TOWN

      They stare at each other.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                It's just hard for me to control my

                passion. I'm a very passionate

                person. (looks to Amado) You're

                from New York. You understand this.

                He goes ice fishing in the midwest.

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                That was told to you in confidence.

                                                         112.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          He's an ice fishing guy. Look at

          him.

                                              SMASH BACK TO:

INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - DAY - FLASHBACK

Where we left off. Stoddard reaches with bloodied hands

across -- what is he reaching for? Oh, on a small table, a

gun and a clip.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          What are you doing pulling out your

          gun? Stop it. That's not you.

                    STODDARD THORSEN

          No, it's me. This is me. It's me.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Don't do something that you don't

          know anything about. Alright?

Richie grabs his gun and starts to load it.

                    STODDARD THORSEN

          DO NOT LOAD THAT GUN. YOU DROP THAT

          GUN.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          I'll show you how it's done. I'm

          not even going to hit you.

He points the gun at Stoddard.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

          Watch this fucko.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. OLD FEDERAL BUILDING - DOWNTOWN

Richie and Stoddard stare at each other in silence.

                    ANTHONY AMADO

          So, you want to use the Sherman

          Suite? The entire floor?

Stoddard throws his head back, looks at ceiling in

exasperation.

                                       113.

          STODDARD THORSEN

OH GOD.

          RICHIE DIMASO

Yes! At the Plaza Hotel.

          ANTHONY AMADO

What happened to the Mafia? I

thought you were --

          RICHIE DIMASO

This is where they intersect! This

is where the two things intersect.

The Politicians and the Mafia.

Victor Tellegio's people who run

resorts international --

          ANTHONY AMADO

Victor Tellegio showed his face?

          RICHIE DIMASO

Yes. I sat with him. I sat with

Victor Tellegio. I hung out with

him. We can get him. We can get his

whole organization as well as

getting any number of congressmen.

I mean, that's just peeling the

first layer of the onion.

          ANTHONY AMADO

Wow. How you going to do that?

          RICHIE DIMASO

We would get ten million dollars

and put it into an account --

          STODDARD THORSEN

TEN MILLION DOLLARS?! Ten Million

dollars?

          RICHIE DIMASO

And that's how we just let them

know we're for real.

          ANTHONY AMADO

What does he say he's gonna do for

the ten million dollars? How are we

trapping him?

          RICHIE DIMASO

He promises to build casinos,

handle the skims, do the licencing -

-

                                                                114.

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                And you have him on tape saying

                this. You have that right? No.

                          ANTHONY AMADO

                    (to Richie)

                I want you to find a safer way to

                get Victor Tellegio on a wire. No

                ten million dollars -- that's

                crazy.

                             STODDARD THORSEN

                Thank you.

      Richie looks down, defeated.

                          ANTHONY AMADO

                Even to entrap Tellegio it's crazy.

                But you can have the Sherman Suite -

                -

                             STODDARD THORSEN

                NO.

                          ANTHONY AMADO

                --Stoddard, please -- To go and get

                me some congressmen. Go get some

                congressmen taking bribes. I want

                to pinch us some congressmen, ok?

                You come back to me. I'm proud of

                you.

                           RICHIE DIMASO

                Thank you.

                (then as an afterthought)

                And Stoddard.

143   INT. CORRIDOR - OLD FEDERAL COURT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS          143

      Richie and Stoddard walk down large, echoey Federal building

      corridor. Stoddard walking ten feet ahead turns and points at

      Richie.

                           STODDARD THORSEN

                    (shouts bitterly)

                Good luck keeping your job, by the

                way, and staying out of jail -- and

                not being killed by the Mob. But

                other than that you're doing a

                great job.

      Stoddard turns and storms off.

                                                                115.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                    (as Stoddard walks away)

                What's the end of the ice fishing

                story?

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                I'm not telling you the end of the

                ice fishing story.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                I'm going to call your fucking

                brother and find out from him.

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                My brother's dead.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                That's how it ends. He fell through

                the fucking ice.

                          STODDARD THORSEN

                    (shouts bitterly)

                No it's not. He died a different

                way, many years later.

      He storms off and leaves Richie staring in the hallway.

      EXT. PLAZA HOTEL -- DAY

      Establishing.

145   INT. PLAZA HOTEL - GENERAL SHERMAN SUITE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 145

      Richie walks out of a surveillance room and down the hallway

      to where Irv and Sydney wait.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                Listen I know it's awkward and I

                just want to say I'm sorry,

                alright? I think we can stick

                together and still fulfill our

                goal. I mean, we got the Sherman

                Suite.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                You got the whole floor?

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                We got the whole floor, yeah.

                          EDITH GREENSLY

                That's good.

                                                          116.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Yeah, you ok?

                       SYDNEY PROSSER

          Yeah. You?

Richie gestures to his eye that Sydney smashed with the

picture frame. He's got a few little scabs.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          It's alright. I got hit a little

          bit. My eye. It's a little blurry

          but I got drops at the pharmacy.

Richie looks over to Irving.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

          Hey, you OK?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Yeah, I'm good --

Richie looks back over to Sydney

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Listen, I'm sorry.

                       SYDNEY PROSSER

          I'm sorry.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

              (to Irving)

          I'm sorry Irving.

Irving doesn't know what to say, starts to say something

twice, stops, can't think of what to say. Leaves Richie

hanging.

INT. PLAZA HOTEL - GENERAL SHERMAN SUITE - DAY

Richie directs where cameras should be concealed. AGENTS

SCHMIDT AND STOCK FOLLOW MAKING NOTES IN PADS.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          You can put a camera here. And we

          get it all on film. You like it?

                       EDITH GREENSLY

          I do.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

              (to Schmidt)

          Give me those flowers.

                             RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

                   If we put the flower base here and

                   put a camera in there we can get a

                   clear shot of the couch there where

                   we can put the congressmen.

      Irving, sitting on the couch, looks kind of disturbed by

      this.

                             IRVING ROSENFELD

                   That's right. That's the idea.

                   And Carmine will go to jail after

                   he delivers us the congressmen soon

                   to be felons.

      Carmine's aid MELORA answers a ringing phone as Carmine sits

      at his desk.

                   Congressman O'Connell is on the

      Dolly Polito, checking the unwatered plants in her husbands

      office with her coat on, she has just stopped by. Turns and

      holds up a parched and dying houseplant.

                             DOLLY POLITO

                   This is sad. It's just sad.

                             CARMINE POLITO

                   Dolly please, I gotta take this.

                             DOLLY POLITO

                   Ok, sorry. Everyone out. Go out.

                   like to discuss with you.

                Congressman, thank you for coming

                by, John --

                          RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)

                Representative O'Connell was

                contacted by Carmine Polito to ask

                if he could obtain rapid

                citizenship through an act of

                Congress for one Sheik Abdullah,

                investor.

      They walk up the capitol steps.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                You wanna talk jobs, investment,

                construction, if we can expedite a

                I'm excited to be here.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                This brings the state back. I mean,

          You know what this is gonna do for

          us? This is huge for the state of

          New Jersey. It stabilizes our

          economy.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Hotels. Restaurants. It's waiting

          to happen. Carmine sees it, this

          fucking thing is waiting to happen.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          The goddamn bankers. Keeping their

          money on the sidelines. How we

          supposed to get anything done?

                    JOHN O'CONNELL

          Bankers only put money in the game

          when they can reap insane profit.

Richie staring, mesmerized by this trap.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          The only problem is this

          citizenship situation. I mean, we

          got to expedite it as soon as

          possible.

                    JOHN O'CONNELL

          Yeah, well I'll tell you, you came

          to the right place.

Everyone looks tense and on edge before.

                    JOHN O'CONNELL (CONT'D)

          I'll make it happen.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Hey, this is going to happen.

Richie slides the briefcase in John's direction.

                    CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)

          This is real. You understand? This

          is real. On my family. On my kids.

          On my life. On my work.

                    JOHN O'CONNELL

          I know that, Carmine. You're a

          good man

This hurts Irving to see his friends sincerity.

                                                             120.

                Carmine you're beloved by your

                One small thing we do for this man

      Irving can't stand how hopeful his friend Carmine is being

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                It's dangerous. We gotta get a wire

                in there. We gotta make him feel

                                                123.

                    PETE MUSANE

          I don't like your husband. You're

          no good together. He doesn't

          appreciate you. Hey, it happens.

          It happened in my marriage. That's

          why I went to Miami. Sometimes you

          just gotta be tough. You gotta

          stand up and you gotta leave, you

          know?

Rosalyn looks at Pete smitten.

                    PETE MUSANE (CONT'D)

          Sometimes you gotta let something

          die to let something live. You're

          too beautiful to be unhappy.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          I know. I mean, I don't want to

          badmouth my husband, but let me

          badmouth my husband for a second.

          He just thinks that he knows

          everything and he's so full of

          shit. He's such a liar. He thinks

          that I'm stupid, but I'm not

          stupid. I hear him on the phone

          arguing. He loves Carmine, but he

          hates that other guy, that curly-

          headed I.R.S. guy, or whatever

          who's carting around my husband's

          ex-lover, that redheaded whore.

                    PETE MUSANE

          IRS?

                     ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Anyway. You can see that it drives

          him crazy.

                    PETE MUSANE

          You said IRS. What IRS guy? What

          are you talking bout?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          I hear them on the phone. I think

          that he's got Irv in some sort of

          bind or something and he's making

          him do all of this stuff and so Irv

          and Carmine right now are at the

          Plaza Hotel throwing away all this

          money at like Congress or whatever.

          They're giving money to congress or

          something. I don't really know but

          I overheard it on the phone.

                                                             124.

      Pete's brow furrows - this is serious.

                          PETE MUSANE

                You know I hate to do this to you

                but I have to go talk to your

                husband. My boss is already angry.

                You stay here I'm going to give you

                some money for a taxi home.

      He puts cash in her hands.

                          PETE MUSANE (CONT'D)

                You stay here. Get yourself some

                dessert. Finish the bottle of

                prosecco. I'm sorry.

      Rosalyn and Pete hold hands as Rosalyn stares into his eyes.

      Very emotional.

                          PETE MUSANE (CONT'D)

                You alright?

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                    (open, vulnerable)

                I don't like change. It's really

                hard for me. Sometimes I think that

                I'll die before I change.

      He kisses her.

                          PETE MUSANE

                It's gonna be okay. You're gonna

                come live with me in Miami.

      Pete gets up and walks. As he does:

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

164             Don't hurt him too bad. He's still                    164

                Danny's father.

                                                       BACK TO:

165   ROSALYN AT TABLE ALONE, EMOTIONAL, VULNERABLE, HER LIFE IS      165

      CHANGING.

166   EXT. PLAZA HOTEL -- DAY                                         166

      Irv and Carmine down sidewalk leaving from The Plaza Hotel --

      Pete Musane stands next to an open passenger side door, --

      Irv and Carmine do not move, they stare at the open door.

                                                             125.

      PAUL MCCARTNEY AND WINGS "LIVE AND LET DIE" STARTS OMINOUSLY.

      INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

170   Rosalyn in full muumuu, wearing cleaning gloves and holding a 170

      vacuum sings to LIVE AND LET DIE while Danny sits on the

      couch watching her. Very intense.

171   INT. PETE MUSANE'S CADILLAC - "LIVE AND LET DIE" CONTINUOUS     171

      Irving and Carmine sit up front with Pete driving and Dick

      Helsing sits in the back seat looking angry.

      INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - "LIVE AND LET

      DIE" CONTINUOUS

      Rosalyn continues to sing and gets more intense as the music

      picks up.

      INT. PETE MUSANE'S CADILLAC - "LIVE AND LET DIE" CONTINUOUS

      Irving looks over to Pete nervously. Unsure of what's going

      to happen.

      INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - "LIVE AND LET

      DIE" CONTINUOUS

      Rosalyn whips her head up and down, dancing manically through

      the house.

      INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Rosalyn sits on the bed with Danny with clothes all over the

      place while smoking a cigarette.

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                Life is ridiculous and I would

                never say anything bad about your

                father in front of you but your

                father is a sick son of a bitch.

                          DANNY

                Daddy's a sick son of a bitch?

                          ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                Don't repeat that. But yes.

                                                        126.

EXT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Irving's Caddy comes screeching up to the house and parks in

the driveway. Irv get's out and races inside.

INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Rosalyn is still sitting on the bed with Danny.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (O.S.)

              (shouts)

          ROSALYN! ROSALYN!

Rosalyn looks scared.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          This is a real low in our

          relationship! You know where I was

          recently? I was in your boyfriend's

          fucking car! I saw your nail

          polish.

                                                  SMASH TO:

INT. PETE MUSANE'S CADILLAC - FLASHBACK

IRVING LOOKS DOWN AND SEES THE BOTTLE OF ROSALYN'S NAIL

FINISH ON THE CAR SEAT -- HE PICKS IT UP, LOOKS AHEAD THROUGH

WINDSHIELD SMELLS IT, WORRIED. Carmine glances over his

shoulder anxiously at Dick Helsing in the back seat.

                    PETE MUSANE

          What's this I hear about your curly

          haired friend working for the

          Government?

                    CARMINE POLITO

          What?! Who said that?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          That's bullshit!

                       PETE MUSANE

          Your wife.

Irving is surprised to hear this.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          That's bullshit.

                       CARMINE POLITO

          Rosalyn?

                                                        127.

INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

              (screams)

          HE PUT A CANVAS BAG OVER MY HEAD!

                                                SMASH TO:

INT. PETE MUSANE'S CADILLAC - FLASHBACK

A WHITE CANVAS BAG GARROTES OVER IRVING'S HEAD, FROM HELSING

IN THE BACK SEAT.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Hey, what the fuck?! --

                    PETE MUSANE

          Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

DICK HOLDS A GUN TO THE BACK OF IRVING'S BAGGED HEAD.

INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          ARE YOU HAPPY NOW? BECAUSE HE IS

          TRYING TO KILL ME!

                    ROSALYN

          What are you talking about?!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT DO YOU

          THINK YOU'RE DOING?

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Get out of here! I'm not doing

          anything!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          WHY ARE YOU TALKING SO MUCH? YOU'RE

          GOING TO GET US ALL KILLED!

Irving looks down to see Danny sitting there on the bed.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          Danny. Come here buddy alright? Go

          draw a picture or something.

Irving ushers Danny out of the room.

                                                       128.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          You're a real sick son of a bitch

          for screaming at me like that in

          front of Danny.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I'M A SICK SON OF A BITCH? YOU'RE

          TRYING TO GET ME FUCKING KILLED. OH

          MY GOD!! YOU DRIVE ME SO FUCKING

          CRAZY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! YOU'RE

          BOYFRIEND -- YOUR FUCKING BOYFRIEND

          WILL KILL ME, HE'LL KILL DANNY, AND

          HE'LL KILL YOU.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          STOP TALKING LIKE THAT!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          He's a mobster alright? That's who

          you're dealing with.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Alright fine! Yes, I wanted to hurt

          you but how do you think that I

          feel all day when you leave me

          alone all day? And all I've ever

          wanted is for you to love me.

          That's all I ever wanted. And stay

          married and for you to love me. And

          that's why I'm going to Miami!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          You're NOT going to Miami.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          That's why I'm going to Miami with

          Pete!

Irving picks up Rosalyn's clothes from the bed where there is

an open suitcase, throws them back in the closet.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          You are NOT going to Miami.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          I finally found somebody who loves

          me just like YOU always wanted.

                     IRVING ROSENFELD

          Too dangerous. Miami? Not now. Too

          dangerous.

Irv continue to throw clothes back into the closet.

                                                       129.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          He likes me just the way I am.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Not now. Everything has to stay

          normal right now. And you're going

          to shut your mouth!

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          You told me that you wanted me to

          find a nice quiet man!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Oh and what a DOOZY you picked!

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          He's the one.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          He's the most dangerous guy ever.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          WELL WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IRVING?! I

          KNOW EVERYBODY THROUGH YOU! WHY

          CAN'T YOU JUST BE HAPPY FOR ME?!

Irving reaches for his heart pills but they fall out of his

hands and scatter on the floor. He bends down to grab them

and almost falls. Rosalyn helps him up.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          Why aren't you taking your heart

          pills? Irving, what's going on?

          What kind of trouble are you in?!

          What's happening?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          (out of breath)

          I've got a plan.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          What's happening?

Irving coughs and steps back. Out of breath and very winded.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I've got a plan.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          You've got a plan? When did you get

          it?

                                                             130.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                It really fucking came to me when I

                was inside of that canvas bag with

                your boyfriend's hands around my

                throat. That's when it really came

                to me.

                Take it off! Take the bag off his

                head!

      Dick pulls the bag off Irving's head, his comb over is all

      messed up. IRVING GASPS. Pete and Dick LAUGH --

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                We've got two million coming this

                week!

                           PETE MUSANE

                What do you think this is? You

                think this is a fucking down

                payment plan? Like were Sears of

                Chevrolet?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                You ask Victor if he wants two

                million this week. That's real

                money. Two million.

                          PETE MUSANE

                Two million? How?

      They LAUGH, Irving's hair is all messed up.

      Pete patches out. Irving and Carmine are a mess, shirts

      ripped open, no buttons, they look at each other VERY SHAKEN.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                Is it true? Is it true what he

                said about your wife?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                It's not fucking true. That's not

                true.

INT. IRV AND ROSALYN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I can save all of us, and we can

          save money. I can take care of you

          and Danny. OK? But you gotta close

          your mouth.

Rosalyn looks satisfied and points her finger at Irving.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          I knew it. I have always said,

          Irving, that you are very, very

          hard to motivate properly. And I

          knew that Pete was gonna go over

          there and knock some sense into

          you. I've been reading this book,

          Irving. It's by Wayne Dyer, about

          the power of intention.

Irving can't believe what he's hearing right now.

Rosalyn, very satisfied, reaches over the bed and grabs a

book.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          And my intention in sending Pete

          over to you was so that you could

          come up with this plan. So, you're

          welcome.

Irving incredulous, thinks to himself how to respond. Forces

himself to say gently --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          OK. Thank you, Rosalyn. Thank you

          for the plan.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          You're welcome.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I appreciate that. So, I think that

          we should be partners on this.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          I'm a good partner. Almost better

          than Edith. You ever think about

          that? You ever think about how you

          might have underestimated me?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          So what is our plan? Tell me the

          plan. What are you gonna do?

                                                         132.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          I'm going to keep my mouth shut and

          I'm not going to say anything but

          what do I do if Pete calls me? What

          am I supposed to say?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          You gotta stop talking about your

          government agencies and your I.R.S.

          and your tax and your conspiracies

          and all of that. You're gonna say

          how you were wrong, you were wrong

          about that.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          I'll tell Pete that I was wrong but

          you know that in real life, I was

          right for saying all that stuff

          because then that spurred on the

          actions that made you come up with

          this plan. So I will tell Pete.

                      IRVING ROSENFELD

                (holding his head)

          OK.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

              (pointing with cigarette

               between fingers)

          The power of intention Irving. The

          power of intention.

Irv is doing everything he can to hold it together.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          OK. You were right.

Rosalyn gets up from the bed and walks over to Irving.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          You're so smart. Good job, peaches.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Irving, I've been doing a lot of

          thinking and -- you need to grow

          up. And you need to face the

          facts. And I think that both of us

          will be a lot happier if we get a

          divorce.

As he listens to words he has been saying himself for months,

now spoken as Rosalyn's idea.

                                                              133.

                            IRVING ROSENFELD

                 OK.

                           ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                 Just think about it. (kisses him)

                 These things are never easy.

       Irving starts walking away towards the door.

                            IRVING ROSENFELD

                 Alright.

                           ROSALYN ROSENFELD

                 Irving. Good luck with your plan.

       EXT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY

       The spare rhythmic intro of Jeff Lynne's "Long Black Road"

       plays as Richie looks back over his shoulder and walks

       towards the building with intensity.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

                 Necessity truly is the mother of

                 invention. The F.B.I. was willing

                 to wire the two million dollars if

                 it meant taking down Tellegio and

                 his entire organization.

       Irving walks with Richie and Sydney up to an office building.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

                 A mobster like Tellegio would never

                 meet at the Plaza Hotel, but only

                 at the office of his attorney,

                 Alfonse Simone.

       Alfonse Simone rises from behind his desk. A silent secretary

       sitting at his side in a white dress stares at our heros as

       Simone steps forward to introduce himself.

                           ALFONSE SIMONE

                 Alfonse Simone.

       Edith walks up to him to shake hands. He shakes hands with

       Irving and Richie as well. Man in the suit closes the door

       behind them.

                           EDITH GREENSLY

                           RICHIE DIMASO

                 Good afternoon.

                           ALFONSE SIMONE

                 Please, be seated.

                                                       135.

They sit in three chairs facing Simone's desk: Sydney/Edith,

Richie, Irving.

Simone sits behind his desk, the silent secretary sits just

behind him slightly to the side, stares at Edith, Richie,

Irving.

                    ALFONSE SIMONE (CONT'D)

          I appreciate the fact that you all

          came in person, but the trip was

          really unnecessary because this

          whole thing could have been done

          with a simple wire transfer. As a

          matter of fact this is the number

          of our wire right here.

Simone slides a small pink piece of paper across the desk to

them. Richie stares at the paper, but doesn't touch it.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Where is Mr. Tellegio?

                    ALFONSE SIMONE

          Mr. Tellegio unfortunately was

          called out of town on business.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          That's not good. We were willing to

          come here today, in person, to see

          Mr. Tellegio, as a sign of respect

          to give two million dollars --

                    ALFONSE SIMONE

          I can assure you that I have the

          power of attorney --

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Excuse me. If you'll let me finish,

          we are willing to give two million

          dollars today of the ten. But

          without Mr. Tellegio here --

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

              (to Simone)

          We can't, we can't make that

          decision. It's not the right thing.

          It's not the right time. It's just

          not good.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

              (to Irving across Richie)

          You don't have the authorization to

          make this kind of choice so don't

          be hasty, alright?

                                                        136.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I'm not being hasty. It's just,

          let's be smart about it. This is

          not how we do business. (to Simone)

          I'm sorry. I apologize.

Richie motions with his hand to Edith that he agrees with

Irving.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          He's right, we can't.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          I think you should hang in there.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          For what? The guy's not here.

                       IRVING ROSENFELD

          He isn't.

                       RICHIE DIMASO

          That's it.

He stands, goes to the door.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          This is a surprise. The Sheik

          doesn't like surprises.

Edith turns in her chair to face them in the doorway.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          Don't leave.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

              (in doorway with Richie)

          Edith, this is not your decision to

          make.

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          I understand but maybe we can call

          the Sheik. Let's call the Sheik.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          That's not the plan. That's not

          the --

Edith locks eyes with Richie. Richie stares at Edith, waves

Irving off with his hand.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          No, let's -- I'll call the Sheik.

          (to Simone) Can I use your phone?

                                                       137.

                       ALFONSE SIMONE

          Please do.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

              (to Alfonse Simone)

          I don't know if he's in, I'll call

          the Sheik. But before I do, I'd

          like to go over specifically what

          this money will be used for.

                    ALFONSE SIMONE

          What we will do is we guarantee all

          proper licenses and construction

          permits for any hotel casino that

          plans to open before the end of the

          year.

Richie glances down at Edith and her handbag. PUSH IN ON A

TINY MICROPHONE WE NOW SEE CLEVERLY BUILT INTO THE HANDLE OF

EDITH'S GUCCI BAG.

                    ALFONSE SIMONE (CONT'D)

          And we'll throw in the customary

          privileges and protection.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          What if there are obstacles, what

          will you do?

                    ALFONSE SIMONE

          Obstacles? We are prepared to

          overcome any obstacles.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          This is a big enterprise.

                    ALFONSE SIMONE

          If we have to pay somebody off,

          we'll pay somebody off. If we have

          to lean on somebody, intimidate

          somebody, we'll intimidate

          somebody. We're experienced. This

          is our business.

RICHIE STARES AT SIMONE.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          That's powerful stuff. Thank you.

IRVING STARES AND SYDNEY LOOKS AT RICHIE.

                                                          138.

                    ALFONSE SIMONE

          And I'll tell you something else.

          At the end of this we'll teach you

          how to skim and how to cut it up

          and make some money on the side.

          Because we invented skimming. We've

          been doing it for thirty years.

A smile creeps across Richie's face.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Thank you. Thank you for clarifying

          that.

Richie picks up the phone to dial.

                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

          I think that will be OK for the

          Sheik.

              (on phone)

          Mr. Tellegio is not here. It's

          just Mr. Alfonse Simone, his

          lawyer. Are we still ok to wire the

          money?

                    ALFONSE SIMONE

          Simone can take the money. What's

          the number?

                    RICHIE DIMASO

Amado writes it down and hands it to Brenda to call in.

Amado nods: victory. BACK TO:

                           ALFONSE SIMONE

                 I think we have a deal.

                 Pleasure doing business with you.

                 Okay, well, thank you very much,

                 Mr. Simone.

       RICHIE SMILES, SYDNEY LOOKS AT IRVING, WHO LOOKS PREOCCUPIED.

       PUSH IN ON IRVING.

                           RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

                 The Sheik's very excited.

                           ALFONSE SIMONE

                 I'm sure that we'll be seeing each

                 other.

       Richie and team start to walk out.

                           RICHIE DIMASO

                     (grinning)

                 Oh I'm sure we'll be seeing each

                 other very soon. You may even get

                 sick of me, like these two.

                           ALFONSE SIMONE

                 I don't think I'll get sick of you.

                 Nice meeting you.

       Richie, Edith, and Irving walk down the hall after leaving

       his office. Richie smiles as the opening of Bowie's "The Jean

       Genie" momentously starts. Edith smiles as she walks down the

       hall followed by Irving. Richie puts his hand on the door

       knob to exit the hallway.

                RESPECT!

      AMADO SITS IN HIS CHAIR WITH CIGAR IN ONE HAND AND DRINK IN

                    (shouts through clamor)

                We're ambitious, that's why!

      Richie suddenly moves to the reel to reel surveillance tape

      and quiets the room, the music momentarily stops as we hear

      Alfonse Simone on the surveillance tape.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                Shh, shh, shh!

                          ALFONSE SIMONE (ON SURVEILLANCE TAPE)

                If we have to pay somebody off,

                we'll pay somebody off. If we have

                to lean on somebody, intimidate

                somebody, we'll intimidate

                somebody.

      Richie joyfully lip synchs to the rhythm of Simone's

      incriminating words on tape.

                    (in unison with Simone on

                -- If we have to lean on somebody,

                intimate somebody, we'll intimidate

                somebody!!

      RICHIE THROWS HIS FIST IN THE AIR AND CHEERS, JOINED BY

180   EXT. CARMINE POLITO'S CAMDEN NJ CLAPBOARD HOME - DAY            180

      Irving's big blue car pulls up to the lens. Irving and Sydney

      looking a little uneasy.

      Irving stares at the house.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                I gotta do it.

181   INT. CARMINE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                                181

                          CARMINE POLITO

                What do you mean, there's no sheik?

                What does that mean, "there's no

                sheik"? What does that mean?

      Carmine stares at Irving.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                I want to face you like a man

                because I want to be real now.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                Who is "they"?

      Irving looks distressed. He's a wreck.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                It's the Feds.

                            CARMINE POLITO

                The Feds?

                            IRVING ROSENFELD

                Yeah.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                Irving -- I'm a good person

                            IRVING ROSENFELD

                You are!

      Carmine stands up and looks around the room, disoriented, his

      life passing before his eyes.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                I've been doing this for a long

                time, for twenty years. Do you

                think I woulda taken that money if

                it wasn't the right thing to do?

                                                142.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Hey look, you're a good person I

          know that but in all honesty --

                    CARMINE POLITO

              (screams)

          You said that was the only way,

          Irv. You chased me, remember?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          They fuckin' made me do it. What

          was I supposed to do? They had Syd

          in jail.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          You made me go back to the Plaza to

          take that money, you piece of shit!

          I was gone! You fucking prick!

CARMINE BEATS IRVING DOWN ON THE COUCH.

                    CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)

          I was gone, I left!

DOLLY WALKS IN.

                    DOLLY POLITO

          Is everything alright? Can I have a

          word with you?

                    CARMINE POLITO

              (very upset)

          No, please, Dolly, just go

          upstairs. Take the kids and go

          upstairs!

                    DOLLY POLITO

          Alright, alright.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I want to make this right. I came

          here because I want to make it

          right.

Irving is in tears. Very upset.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Look at my face. You tell me that

          I'm lying to you when I say that

          everything I do is for the good of

          the people of New Jersey.

          Everything I do is for them. Am I

          lying to you?

                                                         143.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I never had a friend like you

          before.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          I used that money for the goddamn

          casino.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I got some leverage, alright? I can

          help you out.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          This is all shit. It's all

          bullshit.

Carmine picks up the knife the Sheik gave him.

                    CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)

          Look at this thing. Look at this.

          Ceremonial fucking knife. What is

          this bullshit? Some toy?

He drops it on the table. Irving stares at his friend,

removes his glasses.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Carmine, Syd and I got a plan for

          you. We can help you out.

                    CARMINE POLITO

          Please get out of my house, Irving.

          Will you please leave? I'm asking

          you nicely, please leave.

Irving gets up to go and is pushed towards the door by

Carmine. Dolly joins Carmine in tears. Carmine's kids stand

on the stairs.

                    DOLLY POLITO

          Get out of our house!

                     IRVING ROSENFELD

          I don't want to -- (seeing kids)

          I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this

          to happen.

                    CARMINE POLITO

              (to kids)

          This is not our friend!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Truly, I didn't mean for this to

          happen.

                                                             144.

      Carmine points to his family.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                This is what matters to me most and

                you're crushing it! You're going to

                take me away from them you fucking

                son of a bitch? Get the fuck out!

183   Carmine lunges at Irving and punches him in the face. Irving    183

      goes down to the ground and his glasses fly off his face.

      CARMINE kicks him one last time.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                    (beaten, bloody on floor)

                I just want to make it right.

                          CARMINE POLITO

                Get out of my house. Look what you

                made me do!

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                    (stumbling out the door)

                I'm sorry Carmine, I'm sorry.

184   EXT. CARMINE'S HOUSE - DAY                                      184

      Irving staggers out of the house in an emotional daze, one

      hand to his heart, falls to sidewalk with bloody nose and

      broken glasses --

      SYDNEY ACROSS THE STREET BURST OUT OF THE CAR.

                          SYDNEY PROSSER

                Irving!

      RUNS TO HIM IN HER HIGH HEELS -- HELPS HIM SIT UP ON THE

      SIDEWALK.

                          SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)

                Your heart pills. Where are your

                heart pills?

      She digs through his pockets, finds the pills, and feeds one

      to him.

      Sydney struggles to help Irving to his feet and together, an

      embattled but surviving couple, they cross the street arm and

      arm. She opens the door and helps him into the car.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                I've got to lay down.

                                                             145.

                             SYDNEY PROSSER

                Just rest.

      She gets in and closes the door.

185   INT. IRVING'S CADILLAC - DAY                                   185

      They both slump down on the seat, stare at each other,

      emotional, humbled. Sydney gently removes Irving's broken

      glasses. They stare at each other, it is quiet.

                          SYDNEY PROSSER

                    (emotional, quiet)

                Are you ready?

                             IRVING ROSENFELD

                Yes.

      They stare at each other.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

                    (whispers)

                I love you.

      She squeezes his hand, raises it to her lips and kisses it.

206   INT. AMADO'S OFFICE - DAY                                      206

      TILT UP FROM THE FLOOR OF THE OFFICE TO RICHIE, AMADO, AND

      STODDARD INTENSELY STARING AT THE DOOR FOR A CONFRONTATION,

      LIKE IN A WESTERN. THE DOOR OPENS AS IRVING AND SYDNEY ENTER

      AND STARE BACK AT THEM.

                          ANTHONY AMADO

                Please. Come in. Sit down.

      They all sit.

                          ANTHONY AMADO (CONT'D)

                Do you know where our two million

                dollars is?

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                Two million? (Irving pushes his new

                glasses up the bridge of his nose)

                It's with Victor Tellegio and

                Alfonse Simone.

                          ANTHONY AMADO

                No, actually it's not with Victor

                Tellegio or Alfonse Simone.

                                                         146.

Richie stands by the window, stares angrily at Irving.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          He fucking knows about it.

                    ANTHONY AMADO

          It's gone missing. Did you know

          that?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Where's it gone?

                    ANTHONY AMADO

          That's interesting that you said

          that because while you were on your

          way over here, we got an anonymous

          phone call from someone who said

          that in exchange for immunity for

          the two of you and a reduced

          sentence for Carmine Polito we get

          our two million dollars back.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          That's interesting. That's very

          interesting. I have no idea.

                     ANTHONY AMADO

          No idea?

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          No idea what you're talking about.

Irving looks at Sydney who looks back at him and shakes her

head. She doesn't know either.

                    ANTHONY AMADO

          I got it. I understand how these

          deals are made. See, someone has

          leverage.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Anthony, fuck them. It's over. We

          got them for wire fraud, it's over.

          (to Irving and Sydney) You're done.

          You're both done.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I don't think so.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Oh, you don't think so?

                                                             147.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD

                Richard, think about it, YOU

                requested the two million. And you

                gave Brenda the account number. We

                didn't do any of that. None of it.

                (turns dramatically to face Richie)

                How do we know that YOU don't have

                the money?

                           RICHIE DIMASO

                    (Richie looks from Irving

                     to Sydney)

                Am I living in a fucking nightmare

                right now?

      AMADO AND STODDARD STARE INCRIMINATINGLY AT RICHIE.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                I find this a little offensive.

                Really, I find this a little

                offensive and I don't see that you

                got any sort of solid case against--

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                (to Amado and Stoddard)

                Don't let him get in your heads.

                Listen to me, we're dealing with a

                very clever individual.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD

                Richard, think about it. You got

                some big arrests. You got U.S.

                Congressmen. You look good. You're

                gonna be all over the news. You

                know what doesn't look good? A

                story about gross incompetence

      BEHIND HIM.

                          RICHIE DIMASO

                I have a warrant for --

      Richie looks around disoriented, we cannot see what he sees

      yet.

                          RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)

                I'm sorry, do I have the wrong

                office?(checks number on the door)

                Is this 701? Alfonse Simone?

                                                        148.

                    MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

          This is 701.

-- WE REVEAL THE VOICE BELONGS TO A BLACK ATTORNEY -- TWO

BLACK CLIENTS ACROSS FROM HIM -- SEATED AT WHAT PREVIOUSLY

APPEARED TO BE THE DESK OF LAWYER ALFONSE SIMONE.

                    BLACK DIVORCE LAWYER

          My name is Roger Thigpen. I've had

          this office for 25 years. I'm a

          divorce attorney.

RICHIE IS STUNNED.

INT. AMADO'S OFFICE - DAY - BACK TO PRESENT

                    SYDNEY PROSSER

          You lost two million dollars of

          taxpayer money because you were

          confused about the location and the

          identity of Victor Tellegio's

          attorney?

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. POOL PARTY - LONG ISLAND HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACK

Where we first saw Irving at the pool party.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

          The role of Tellegio's attorney,

          Alfonse Simone, was played by our

          friend Ed Malone --

Camera pans from Irving to Ed Malone:

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

          the "Cold Cut King of Long Island"--

Ed Malone holds up two packages of cold cuts. Also holding

the cold cuts are the two that frisked everyone at Simone's

office.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

          Whose party we were at when Sydney

          and I first met.

Cut to Irving first meeting Sydney.

                                                  CUT TO:

                                                       149.

INT. ALFONSE SIMONE'S OFFICE - DAY - FLASHBACK

Ed Malone, dressed as Alfonse Simone, steps to camera to

shake Richie's hand.

                    ED MALONE

          Alfonse Simone.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ANTHONY AMADO'S OFFICE - DAY - BACK TO PRESENT

                    EDITH GREENSLY

          People believe what they want to

          believe Richie.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          That's because you conned me! You

          both fucking conned me. You both

          got under me. You did!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Well that doesn't sound so good,

          either. I mean -- and I don't know

          what you're talking about, but --

          let's just assume you want to go

          with that story. Really? That's the

          story you want to go with? That's

          what you want the New York Times to

          hear? That you got conned by the

          very con men who you forced to

          entrap the members of Congress in

          the first place. That's what you

          want to go with? That doesn't sound

          so good for your whole thing.

Richie looks like he's going to be sick.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          And how ironic that the most

          creative minds, the ones who are

          working hardest to get the economy

          of New Jersey going, those are the

          ones that you round up. And why?

          Because what, they're the easiest

          to go after? And what about the

          real bullshit artists? You didn't

          even come close to the big leagues.

          Those big guys. The money men.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          That's what I was trying to go

          after.

                                                         150.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          I'm sorry to tell you, you got none

          of 'em.

                    STODDARD THORSEN

          You know, Richard, I think we may

          call you as a witness, but

          otherwise you're done. I think you

          better go home.

Richie disoriented, appeals to Stoddard.

                    RICHIE DIMASO

          Stoddard --

                    STODDARD THORSEN

          Go on home, Richard.

ELO's "10538 Overture" reprises on the soundtrack.

EXT. FBI OFFICE, FEDERAL OFFICE BUILDING, NY - DAY

Camera tilts down from the Federal Building to find Richie

coming down the stairs, emotional. Richie walks wiping his

eyes, his innocence and Edith, lost.

                                                     CUT TO:

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

          We took down some very big guys.

-REP. SANDERS SWARMED BY PHOTOGRAPHERS WALKING OUT OF

BUILDING, ESCORTED BY FBI AGENTS.

-REP. SIMMONS ESCORTED OUT OF CITY HALL.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

          Some of whom were just doing

          business as usual helping their

          communities or their states.

-REP. KESHOYGAN IS GRABBED AS HE APPROACHES HIS CAR IN A

GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT WITH A BAG FULL OF GROCERIES.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

          But some of them knew they had

          larceny in their blood--

-REP. O'CONNELL COVERS HIS FACE AS PHOTOGRAPHERS SWARM HIM AS

HE'S ARRESTED OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE AS WIFE AND DAUGHTER LOOK ON.

                                                              151.

      CARL ELWAY IS CHELSEA HOTEL OFFICE IN HIS BATHROBE WITH HIS

      SECRETARY IN TEARS.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

                And they even admitted it.

      GREY HAIRED SENATOR HORTON MITCHELL, wife by his side, denies

      any wrongdoing and is photographed and humiliated as he then

      sits with her in a Federal car.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

                But in all it was six Congressmen,

                one United States Senator, and my

                friend, Carmine Polito.

      THE DOOR TO CARMINE'S CLAPBOARD HOUSE OPENS, CARMINE STANDS

      IN THE DOOR, STARES AT THE AGENTS, HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN IN

      TEARS STAND BEHIND HIM AS HE SERVED A WARRANT. CARMINE IS

      HANDCUFFED.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

                We gave the two million back so

                Carmine got the reduced sentence.

                18 months. The loss of his

                friendship would haunt me for the

                rest of my life.

      CROWDED FEDERAL BUILDING PRESS CONFERENCE - MANY FLASHBULBS

      AS STODDARD STANDS NEXT TO AMADO WHO MAKES THE ANNOUNCEMENT.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

                And when the story was written,

                Richard Dimaso's name was never

                mentioned.

      CAMERA PANS THROUGH CROWD TO FIND RICHIE IN THE WAY BACK,

      LEANING AGAINST A PILLAR. FADE TO WHITE ON HIS SOBERED FACE.

209   EXT. LONG ISLAND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY                        209

      FADE IN FROM WHITE, PAN DOWN FROM WHITE SKY TO SCHOOLYARD,

      CHILDREN LEAVING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. IRVING AND SYDNEY WALK UP

      TO THE SCHOOL TO PICK UP DANNY.

                           IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

                Syd and I moved in together. And

                Rosalyn --

      ROSALYN IN A NECK BRACE and off white trench coat and

      sunglasses -

                                                         152.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          The car is a little dinged up and

          I'm a little stiff but I don't want

          to talk about it.

Irving stares at Rosalyn.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

          She would always be interesting.

Rosalyn gets in to a car, revealing Pete Musane in the

driver's seat. Irving leans in.

                    PETE MUSANE

              (to Irving)

          You know my boss knows you did him

          a solid.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD

          Yes I did. He never took a nickle

          so they can't get him for nothing.

          I was never going to let that

          happen.

Irving starts to leave --

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD

          Irv.

He stops and looks at her. With red lacquered nails Rosalyn

places her favorite nail finish in his hand.

                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD (CONT'D)

          I'm done with this nail finish. Bye

          for now. I'll see you next weekend.

Irving nods. Rosalyn drives off with Pete.

Sydney stands with Danny.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

          Our conning days were behind us.

Irving and Sydney walk hand and hand with Danny down the

street. Irv drops the nail finish into a trashcan.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

          You can fool yourself for just so

          long and then your next reinvention

          better have your damn feet on the

          ground.

                                                             153.

210   INT. ART GALLERY - DAY                                          210

      Irving and Sydney admire a piece of art on the wall.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

                We got a loan from a bank and were

                able to go gallery legitimate.

      INT. SMALL BANK - DAY

      Irving and Sydney sit in front of a banker asking for a loan.

                          IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)

                The art of survival is a story that

                never ends.

      INT. SYDNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

      SYDNEY PLACES THE NEEDLE ON THE RECORD PLAYING ON A

      TURNTABLE: DUKE ELLINGTON'S JEEPS BLUES, begins. SHE STARES

      ACROSS THE ROOM AT IRVING. IRVING STARES BACK HER.

      CUT TO BLACK
