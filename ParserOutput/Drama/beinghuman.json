But there is just one story. Because we blend into one developing narrative the lives that we show. There is no suggestion of time travel or re-incarnation or any other tricksy or mystic device. We can do in real time and with real characters what other movies strive to do with immortal time travellers and ghosts. Our story is thoroughly based in reality and the magic we are dealing with is real, human magic. In moving from one character to the next everything will change; supporting characters, setting, period. But the essential situation of our hero of the moment will relate to the one before and the one following. The magic will be in the transitions, in leaving one character and advancing the film through hundreds or thousands of years to find our next hero in tantalizingly similar human circumstances. The effect of these transi- tions across space and time, will let the audience grasp the simple truth behind our story; that we are all in it together. The key to allowing the audience to enjoy this human connection at the heart of the film is that one actor will play the six individuals. The feeling will be of the endless, glorious playing and replaying of the simple drama of being alive. We end the film with a present-day hero, but by that time we will be seeing this modern man in an entirely fresh light, feeling his kinship with the caveman and the slave and the others who have gone before. The resolution of his contemporary story is theirs also. By then perhaps, we will be able to see ourselves in this novel perspec- tive, too. And the structure of the film itself has the thrill of novelty. It has never before been used in cinema. Never. Our six characters and their stories connect in many different ways, some obvious, others vague, tanta- lizing threads. Even global connections are made, as the planet itself and all its people, come and go in the story. For the audience the game of making the connec- tions, feeling the bonds, even inventing or discovering associations of their own, will be endless in this big- gest of stories, smallest of stories. It is truly a new cinematic experience.                                       * *",

He and his woman and two children live near the ocean in a sheltered fold on a hillside, a shallow cave given protection at its entrance by a covering of branches and brush.

If it ever went out it would be a catastrophe, so it remains a smouldering com- fort and a constant preoccupation for the whole family. Hector doesn't know that his name is Hector. It is simply a convenience to help us tell his story. The idea of individual names is an imaginative leap that has not yet been made by mankind when we first meet him. Hector is living out his life 4000 years before the birth of Christ, in a reasonably temperate zone of the planet. In his entire life Hector will traverse no more than ten square miles of it.

Hector is enjoying himself, deflecting his stream of pee now and then so that his image reforms itself and then is disrupted again. When he is finished, a trace of vanity makes him bend down closer to his reflection. He strokes his long hair and fingers a blemish on his cheek. Then he is aware of another presence.

Beyond the fire on a rock shelf HECTOR plays with his children, a GIRL of six and Boy of eight. It is the usual rough romp that fathers indulge in, but in 4000 BC possibly rougher than normal.

Deidre scowls at Hector. If    the gesture had been invented he would probably shrug   his shoulders. The Boy howls on. Hector kneels beside his daughter, absorbed in her antics as she sleeps. She is a vivid dreamer. Her whole little form wriggles and contorts in response to the fantasy unspooling in her head. She emits unearthly nighttime noises, squeals and giggles and moans. Hector is fasci- nated. Where has his daughter gone? Who is this strange wild creature that has taken her form, lying beside him? Hector's daughter delights him. And while Hector watches his daughter, Deirdre from their bed watches Hector. It is almost dawn, the cave is quiet and the fire has diminished. By its light we see Deirdre and Hector making love, on their bed of dried grass and skins. It's diffi- cult to say what their lovemaking might look like. What has 6000 years done to that art? We will think about it. On the far side of the cave we see the sleeping children. As we MOVE CLOSER we see that they are far from sleep. Two sets of bright eyes peek out from under their cover. We CUT BETWEEN them, the loving parents and the watching, learning children. Hector is arguing with his son, just outside their cave. The Boy wants to go foraging with him again.",

SHORE - DAY                                             5 Hector is foraging on the shoreline, gathering cockles, seaweeds, mussels, crabs, anything edible. He splashes in the shallows, hoarding the food in a roughly-woven bag. Every now and then he will suck a cockle from its shell or crunch on a particularly tasty piece of seaweed. Hector looks about 30 years old. This is advanced middle age for his times and it shows. He has a heavy cold and an irritating hack in his throat. In a similar condition a modern individual would spend two or three pleasantly drugged days in bed, perhaps attempting a little light paperwork propped up on some pillows. The sun is warming the day. Hector sits on a rock, sur- veying his world. He seems very much a part of it. He watches some wading seabirds nearby. Like him they are nosing around the margins of low tide for food. He smiles. In another season they or their eggs will pro- vide a meal or two. There is a strange atmosphere of appropriateness in the scene, Hector seems such an inte- gral part of it. The easy fit of the man in his land- scape strikes us. Hector belongs to it in ways that a present-day hunter or holiday maker, or even naturalist, never could. Also, there is an odd sense of the world being rather empty. Whether the larger world is round or flat,   spinning or orbiting, Hector neither knows nor cares.    He knows simple things. Cold and hunger. He knows     warmth, rough comfort and companionship. His family and    the safety of their cave. Further along the shore Hector drops his bag and straigh- tens himself, easing the ache in his back. Then some- thing disturbs him. From behind a distant headland a smudge of smoke trails into the sky. Hector picks up his bag and runs. He knows where he is going. He reaches a vantage point on some rocks. He steadies himself and gazes hard out to sea. We can feel the strain in his eyes as he tries to detect any hint of threat in the glinting water. Then his jaw drops in fear. Around the edge of the headland two dark shapes proceed in regular motion. Their steady progress is full of menace. Oar- driven boats, slowly, insistently making their way into Hector's bay. He jumps from the rocks and runs up the beach toward the cave. One thing else that Hector knows is fear, blind, gut-turning fear. 6   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          6 Hector is a small figure in the landscape now, racing up the steep slope in the direction of his home.

The shapes are distinct now, two large open boats, roughly made but menacingly adequate for their purpose, coastal raiding. The boats are nearing the beach now and figures can be seen preparing to land. Hector gathers enough of his wits and strength to continue his race up the hillside. 7   INT. HECTOR'S CAVE - DAY                                     7 Inside, his family are in a state of panic. They seem to have prepared for this moment. Through their agitation there is purpose. They gather bits and pieces to carry with them in their flight. Hector's children are attemp- ting to take too much. Hector shouts instructions to them as he puts more wood on the fire. It must stay burning in their absence. Hector gathers his family together and they leave the cave. 8   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          8 Hector shoves his children in one direction up the slope further into the hills. His woman runs off the other way.

BEACH - NIGHT                                        13 It is fully dark now. On the beach the Raiders have set up a comfortable camp with a large fire. We are still with Hector. He has come down from his bleak hiding place in the hills. The smell of fire and food and con- cern for his family, have drawn him here. He is hiding somewhere way off from the camp, but close enough to observe it. What he sees disturbs him, but for odd reasons. His family appear to be happily integrated with the Raiders. His two children have become fast friends with the man who coaxed them from the tree. His woman is with a larger group closer to the fire. They are playfully attempting to communicate with her, and although still a little timid, she is smiling. There is no hint of bar-         * barity, rape or abuse. That was not the intention of the Raiders. To them, a fertile woman and two healthy children are as gold will be to plunderers of later ages. For their part, the family have to accept the situation. Food and shelter are the best that life can offer. Painfully, Hector takes in the reality of the scene. His family have been stolen from him, plain and simple. In the morning they will be gone, out to sea and round the headland forever. He watches them for a while longer, then it becomes too painful. He retreats into the dark- ness and up into the empty hills again. 14   EXT. ROCK SHELTER - NIGHT                                 14 Hector spends a long, cold night alone, squatting in a narrow crevice in the rocks. He doesn't sleep, or even attempt to close his eyes.

It seems to revive him, refresh him, even comfort him. A sign, however meager, that life goes on. Then Hector trots off in the direc- tion of the shore. There is not much else that he can do. 16   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           16 The Raiders are loading up their boats, wading back and forth from the shoreline.

The last Raiders are climbing aboard. Hector charges at full speed to the water's edge. He screams agonizingly at the Raiders and impotently starts throwing stones at them. The Raiders all look at him. The LEADER is impudently brushing Hector's missiles aside, like so many flies and smiling. Suddenly Hector's rage and energy leave him. He stands looking at the Raiders and they look at him, for a long moment. The Raiders are all young men, hardly into their twenties, and nowadays might resemble something like a          * motorcycle gang. But in Hector's time they are men in the full prime of life. They begin to laugh and exchange remarks about Hector. He returns their looks fiercely. His woman and children sit on the boat, frozen in fear.         * The Leader eventually turns from Hector, still smiling and gives an order. The men lift their oars and prepare to leave. Then an older man stands up in the other boat. He calls over to the Leader, nodding in the direction of Hector. Hector doesn't know what they are saying, but they have an intense exchange, obviously centered on him. The older man seems to be an adviser, a priest or wise man, although he's still only about thirty years old. The Leader listens to him intently. The PRIEST talks and points to the cliffs. The Leader looks there and nods his head. He gives some instructions to his men. Hector stands, bemused. Six or so of the Raiders leave the boats, wade ashore and without any resistance from him, take hold of Hector. Hector's children instictively rise        * as if to defend their father, but Deirdre, despite her          * own feelings, wisely holds them back.                           * 9. 17   EXT. CLIFFS - DAY                                             17 Hector's hands have been bound with rope. He is being led up to the top of the cliffs. The Priest and the Leader walk on ahead, still talking intensely. At the top of the cliff the bay and the boats and the wide sea are stretched out beneath them. The Priest, as they arrive, becomes excited. He points to a pile of large stones at the very summit of the headland. The mound of stones is obviously man-made.",

The Raiders prepare to move off. Hector is an embarrassment to them now. At the last moment the Leader gives a brusque order to one of his men. The man clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again, carrying a large flint-bladed knife. He comes out of the water and walks up to Hector. Hector is beyond any form of reaction. He will take whatever is offered to him. The man comes close, the knife held ready. He stands in front of Hector for a moment. On the boat, Hector's family are tense with fear for his life.

A clean, beautifully tiled world of lazing figures, droning conversations and resonant laughter. It is the hot room of a bathhouse somewhere in the Roman Empire. We have advanced 4000 years into the future and it shows in the technology. It is men's day at the bathhouse. All of the people relaxing in the water look prosperous and comfortable with themselves. Slaves wait in attendance, some around the edge of the pool, others in the water rubbing backs and massaging shoulders. There are three or four times as many slaves as bathers, and the proprie- torial way that they look after their masters gives the place the odd atmosphere of a kindergarten for over- indulged grown-ups. And then we find our Hector. He stands against the wall, holding a large towel. Although clean-shaven and more healthy-looking we can still recognize Hector, more so         * by the look in his eyes. There is a set to his face that tells us he is a man alone, emotionally detached from his surroundings. He is a personal body slave. He watches his master in the pool, alert to any hint of need that he might have. Hector's master LUCINNIUS is not as relaxed as the others around him. He is in anxious conversation with an older        * man wading beside him. We don't hear what they are saying but there is enough body language to detect Lucinnius' pleading and the older man's cool distraction. The older man gives a final dismissive shake of his head.

Hector then moves out of earshot, but still alert to his master's behavior. Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to casually join his friends. The eldest of the three gives off as much of the aura of a Godfather as a naked man in a towel can. The other two are deferential to the older man, and treat Lucinnius with apparent con- tempt. Hector watches the older man put a paternal hand on Luccinius's shoulder and speak with a calm smile on his face. Hector almost winces to see his master submit to this patronizing treatment. Slave and master exist so closely together that many of their feelings are shared. More precisely, Lucinnius's feelings are shared by Hector. It is a one-way exchange. From morning until night, and probably in his dreams too, Hector is living two lives, his own and his master's. Here in ancient Rome is this what they call classic schizophrenia? As Luccinius stands to leave we can    tell by their expres- sions that the THREE MEN are open in    their contempt for him. Hector is quickly on his feet     and by Lucinnius's side as he goes.

It is difficult to tell from the people because they are such a cosmopolitan crowd, faces from every corner of the Mediterranean world. It has some- thing of the atmosphere of a frontier town in a western, except that here the half-finished buildings are made of brick and stone. Lucinnius leaves the bathhouse. Hector follows three paces behind him, loaded down with the large towel, the scrubber, robe, and the wooden stool. The stool goes with them everywhere, in case Lucinnius has to stop in the street and converse with a friend. Other notables are among the street throng, their own slaves tagging along behind with their little wooden stools. Some have whole trains of slaves shadowing them. Human status symbols.

STREET - MORNING                                       33 Hector and Lucinnius are approaching the home of Cyprian. Hector as usual is walking some paces behind his master, and he carries a large satchel of documents. Cyprian's home is a street palace. It is early in the morning, but there is already activity around the house, visitors coming and going, messengers, petitioners. A few impor- tant callers arrive in litters, carried by slaves. Lucinnius and Hector even have to join a line at the door and are checked in by the gateman. Lucinnius's hopes of quietly bending Cyprian's ear are dashed. It seems as if the whole world owes allegiance to this provincial Mr. Big. 34   EXT. COURTYARD - MORNING                                    34 The slaves gather on one side of the courtyard, gossiping and playing games of chance on the ground. Their masters wait on the other side of the courtyard, seated on benches along the wall. Cyprian's aides usher the visitors into his presence in a regular flow, some have an audience of a few minutes, others last merely seconds. Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius, like a mother watching her child from a distance on its first day at school. (CONTINUED)",

Straight-backed, hands on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri- ficial offering himself. Hector plays a game of five-stone with some other slaves as he watches Lucinnius shuffling up the bench place by place to the front of the line. We almost expect Hector to give him a little wave of encouragement as he is finally summoned into the inner office. Hector waits. The first signs seem good. Lucinnius doesn't emerge within the first minute. Cyprian is at least giving him the time of day. More minutes pass. Hector watches a game of handball while keeping an eye on the office door. One or two others, familiar to us from the bathhouse, go into the office. So does Lucinnius' friend Julian. Eventually Lucinnius emerges into the sunlight, a broad smile on his face. Hector relaxes and leaves the ball game to join him.",

It is a  cold fresh day of early summer. They are       * travelling high in the mountains. Hector dawdles on his way, eating a hard biscuit he takes from his pocket. The last sound he hears from the wagon is the renewed WAILING OF the GIRL. Hector lays himself down at the           * side of the road. His eyes begin to close. Then a SOUND in the distance makes him open them again. He listens. MORE SOUNDS drift up to him from the floor of the valley. He stands up and crosses the track. At first he can see nothing. He walks back along the rim of the road. Then he sees where the noise is coming from. A mounted skirmish is in progress, just where a wooden bridge crosses the small river, at the very bottom of the valley. There are no more than 30 knights in full armor, with twice as many foot soldiers and squires. Even from such a distance Hector can see and hear that the fighting is ferocious, almost insane in its intensity. From this distance it is like a puppet show, except the violence is real. The scene places Hector in his time and for us there is a strange feeling to it, almost as if Hector has awoken from sleep and found himself transported to some distant age. But this is not the case. Hector is where he belongs, in Medieval Europe. Hector makes his decision. With a last look behind him         * he runs off in the direction of the wagon. Like any wise citizen of a violent age, Hector knows when to leg it. 54   EXT. WAGON - DAY                                          54 Hector catches up with the moving wagon and jumps onto it, happily back in the security of his fellow                 * travellers.

FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         57 In the dark, sleeping bodies lie all over the floor of an upstairs room. Gentle snores and regular breathing lay a blanket of soft sound over the human forms. One of the forms stirs and sits up on one elbow. Hector, in another corner of the room, sleeping lightly, becomes aware of this. He watches as the figure stands up and picks its way between the bodies to the door. The figure pauses and crouches over Beatrice. Hector can hear the distinct sounds of the figure sniffing her, from head to toe, and then a deep, long sigh. The figure stands up and moves quietly to the door, disappearing downstairs. Hector rouses himself and follows the other. 58   INT.

Wounded men lie awaiting the attentions of either the medicos or the priest. Prisoners huddle in cowed groups. Everyone looks for food. Individual soldiers, like lost souls, run here and there trying to regroup with their comrades. The youngest are squires of twelve or thir- teen, the oldest are red-faced, overweight knights in expensive armor. Hector and Beatrice have found a quiet corner where they can sit and talk. Behind them is a group of soldiers, reserves who have not yet joined the battle. They are much fresher than the rest and are drilling as a disci- plined unit. Their movements are a strange cross between parade ground drill and battle training. To the BEAT of DRUMS they perform rhythmic, hypnotic movements, repeating the same pattern over and over again. A deadly dance, thrusting their pikes in unison. They become like one evil, inhuman machine. It is mesmerizing to watch, all the                * more so in relation to the coy seduction scene that Hector and Beatrice are acting out. They have the problem of not sharing a language, but, resourceful as lovers are, they soon employ this as another titillating element in their love-play.",

He steps over her and settles into his own space by the window. He suddenly misses the presence of Hector. He looks again at Beatrice, still and sleeping. What the Priest doesn't see is the extra pair of hands massaging her neck and head. She moans softly in her pretence of sleep. The Priest is troubled, suspicious, but he doesn't know why. He sniffs again, in the general direction of Beatrice. The mingled smells that his sensitive nose detects perplex him, but he settles down, pulling his           * cloak over his head. Across the room, Hector's head emerges from the covering beside Beatrice. They make love quietly in the dark, also enjoying the thrill of confounding the Priest. 69   INT.

In the room it is still semi-dark. The Priest sits up. The others have already left, but Beatrice is there, stretching herself and fixing her hair. Hector is not with her. She smiles at the Priest.

He handles some of the things spilling from her bag, lying beside him. Her dried flowers and herbs, which he sniffs, her little bottles and phials. Witches brew? Or simply an early version of a cluttered handbag? We don't know what is passing through Hector's mind. Perhaps he is trying to work out how he came to be lying with the strange, wonderful, unknowable creature by his side. And how many people have done that through the ages, in caves or by campfires, or in suburban bedrooms?

Hector sits quietly with a smile on his face, their chatter incomprehensible to him. 81   EXT.

Dom Paulo leads the young boy through an intricate, pretty tune. They sit formally and there is an air of stoicism about them, determined as they are to maintain their civilized habits in these bleakest of circumstances. But there is also a feeling of madness about it. The madness of a man who has lost a grip of what is going on about him. Down on the beach men are waiting to die in the morning on his orders. The blend of formality and madness make the scene comic. 101   EXT. CAMP - DAWN                                          101 The sun has risen sharply, soaring out of the ocean. It blinds the eyes of those in the little execution party making their way along the beach. The cross-cum-scaffold has been erected some way from the camp. Most people are  attending to their morning chores with one eye on the grim act of justice being carried out along the shore. Our view of the hangings will be from the distance of the camp; marionette figures, men dancing on ropes, the form- ality of legal death. The priest and the executioners. It takes a while for the people in the camp to become aware of the other observers up on the dunes. Three figures stand in full view, boldly, silently, watching the camp and the pantomime at the scaffold. The word passes around the camp. Eyes pass between the executions and the tall natives watching.   The first man is already dangling on the rope by the time that Dom Paulo and his officers are discussing the appearance of the natives.",

He is watching a young Girl and the boy Nuno. They are twelve or thirteen years old. They are coyly in the early stages of making love, the Boy lying close to the Girl, kissing her, beginning to caress her. Their                  * love-making is poised oddly between child's play and               * eroticism. It's their day of discovery and it is like a dream of love. The Boy is just about to   discover some more and is fumbling with the Girl's   clothing, when he looks up and catches sight of Hector.    Hector ducks down but knows he has been seen and decides   to brazen it out. He stands up in full view of them.",

Deirdre is trailing behind them. She was right. She doesn't have the stamina for the hill. Hector looks back and sees the Raiders gaining on her. His face is a con- fusion of fear and indecision. He almost stops, as if to go back and help her, but then changes his mind and runs off once again with the children. Deirdre is by now throwing the things she is carrying at her pursuers, hoping that they will stop to retrieve them and allow her to gain some ground. But they don't stop and the effort tires her even more. She attempts one final dash and then, all of her energy gone, she stops in her tracks and waits for her pursuers. the Raiders break their run also and trot and finally walk, the distance between them and Deirdre. Hector is watching all of this over his shoulder, still running. He stops for a moment to watch Deirdre being finally surrounded by the Raiders. Then he runs on. 9    EXT. VALLEY - DAY                                          9 Hector is tiring, too. With the Girl still awkwardly clinging to his neck he is picking his way up a steep slope, half-dragging the Boy up behind him. He stops for a breath and sees the raiders moving into the valley below. In a moment of utter panic he lets go of his son, drops the Girl from his shoulder, and runs on alone. We can sense the moment of release in his unburdened flight. But it doesn't last long. Some way up the slope he stops and turns. He sees his children, only now beginning to work out what has happened, and the raiders below. He can't do it. Even as the Girl calls to him he is running back down the hill, feeling the first stab of a guilt that will never leave him.",

He lifts his hands and the man with some effort hacks through the rough hemp. Then he turns and wades back to the boat. As the man clambers aboard the Leader speaks to him. The man stops, drops back into the water, and returns to Hector on the shore. He offers Hector the cut piece of rope, a weird gesture of conciliation. He even smiles. Hector refuses the gift. The man stands sheepishly for a moment, then drops the rope at Hector's feet and wades back to the boat. A piece of rope in exchange for a family. Hector watches them for some time, his family and the strange Raiders, as they, achingly slowly, retreat from his view and his life. At last he turns and moves up from the shoreline. He goes some distance then stops, thinks for a moment, then retraces his steps. He goes back to the water's edge, picks up the piece of rope that bound him, and walks off with it. It might be of some use to him. 19   INT. CAVE - DAY                                            19 Hector has returned to his cave home, now cold and empty of life.

Most of what he has earned or plundered in his colonial years now lies at the bottom of the ocean. Since he is socially superior to anyone else on the ship he assumes responsibility and command. There are probably fifty men among the survivors more suited to lead them to safety. By Dom Paulo's side always is his SON. A quiet boy of about eleven. He is like a little miniature of his father, dressed in the same style of clothes. He is a constant, silent witness to everything that Dom Paulo does, good or bad, wise or foolish. He and his father are a continuing fascination for Hector, and we can enjoy Hector watching the boy watching his father. Some of the absurdities and comedies of the situation can be high- lighted in this way. There can be sadness in it too however, the pain of a son witnessing his father's compromises or failures all too closely, and Dom Paulo's sad awareness of his image slowly tarnishing in his son's eyes. Amidst the construction work, Dom Paulo is talking with some of his OFFICERS.",
