D'ANGELO He looks disturbed. INT./EXT. BACKSTAGE AND COURTYARD From D'Angelo's point of view.  CAMERA LOOKS UP at Steve. The Quintet is now reaching the end of the number, a driving rhythm of considerable excitement.  A waiter passes in f.g. and the CAMERA CRANES BACK through the curtained doorway to the backstage part of the club.  This movement is continued as we see some other employees, including Jerry Wiggins, the intermission pianist, who is waiting in the corridor near the fire-exit.  As he steps out of the door to discard a cigarette, CAMERA AGAIN CONTINUES ITS MOVEMENT, CRANING BACK AND DOWNWARD into the little courtyard.  Here, it discovers the figure of a young woman who is waiting in the shadow near the steps of the fire-escape, listening to the music. CLOSER ANGLE This is SUSAN HUNSECKER.  She wears an expensive mink coat. It is oddly in contrast with her personality; the face is sensitive and intelligent, but childlike and tragic.  A girl in adolescence already burdened with problems beyond her capacity.  Over scene, the music continues.  Susan shifts her position, knowing that the session will soon be at an end and that the musicians will be coming backstage. INT. ELYSIAN ROOM Steve is playing the last bars of the number; the whole group now in unison. QUINTET The music comes sharply, dramatically to its finish.  There is some applause.  The boys relax.  Steve reaches for the microphone and in the characteristically casual manner of the \"cool\" musician, announces the end of the set, thanking the audience, identifying the quintet by name and introducing the intermission pianist.  During this, Carson, Chico and Paul wander off the bandstand behind him. EXT. BACKSTAGE AND COURTYARD Chico, Paul and Carson come through to the corridor backstage. As they do so, Chico, glancing out of the open door sees Susan in the courtyard.  He goes out onto the fire-escape; Paul following behind.",

CAMERA is on the bandstand, moving smoothly through the group of five musicians as the rhythm of a new number is set up: first the leader (a guitarist) snaps his fingers, giving the tempo to...the bass, who \"walks\" with the beat, bringing in...the drums, which start a quiet, insistent wire-brush background for...the cello and the flute, whose introductory phrases, set the stage for... STEVE DALLAS ...the guitar, the leader again.  It comes in after this short preamble with the first statement of melody. (The tune has a faint echo of significance because it is one of the themes of the film, already heard as a phrase in the background score of the title music.) CAMERA lingers a moment on the guitarist, STEVE DALLAS.  He is a youth of pleasant, intelligent appearance.  He plays with the intent air of the contemporary jazz musician who takes his work very seriously indeed and affects a much greater interest in the music and his fellow musicians than in the listening audience. SIDNEY A close shot.  Sidney has just entered the club, strolling into the vestibule near the entrance.  He wears an expression of oddly unsuitable antagonism, as he looks forward... DALLAS Seen in long shot from Sidney's viewpoint.  CAMERA moves to include Sidney in foreground again.  He turns as he is accosted by RITA, the cigarette girl of the club.  She is a pert creature, attractive and not unaware of the fact.",

Sidney maneuvers his way between the parked cars towards the entrance and the CAMERA DESCENDS to SHOOT ALONG the courtyard towards the entrance.  We see the figure of Jimmy Weldon and his girl friend coming out of the Club. CLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT Jimmy Weldon is coming out of the Club accompanied by a girl; he is slightly tight.  As he steps through the outer doors, Weldon again spies Sidney on the sidewalk; he steps to one side of the entrance way. Sidney slips through the congestion, but just as he tries to enter the Club, Weldon's hand shoots out, neatly ambushing him, pulling him aside into the narrow courtyard.  Sidney is instantly resentful of this manhandling, but has to adjust himself, assuming a quick smile for the benefit of Weldon.",

There are no other customers at the counter, but the man behind is squeezing orange halves for the day ahead, piling up a mountain of empties some of which fall at Sidney's feet. EXT.

The walls of Mary's cubicle are covered with photographs; filing cabinets are piled high with unopened mail; two wire service teletype machines click desultorily. Mary is plain but attractive, past 30, a level-headed woman with a sense of integrity.  She is on the phone just now, bored with the insistent voice on the other end.

ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT Steve Dallas' Quintet on the stand.  CAMERA FRAMES the group in foreground, SHOOTING towards the entrance way. INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT Sidney has come in through the entrance.  He is taking off his overcoat.  He moves forward past the hat check room on the left, approaching the recess in which several music cases are stacked beside a coat rack on which the musicians' overcoats are hung. DETAIL As he hangs up his coat, Sidney identifies the other coat, a black and white check raglan which he (and we) saw Steve wearing when he visited Hunsecker at the TV Studio. SIDNEY A CLOSE SHOT.  The coat appears to have some significance for him; Sidney is under tension. A waiter, carrying a carton of beer cans, comes out of the doorway just behind Sidney, moving between him and the overcoat.  Thus interrupted, Sidney turns away. INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT Robard is standing at the bar, surrounded by a group of his cronies.  Drink is flowing and there is a sentimental mood of celebration. As Sidney arrives at the bar, ordering a drink, FRANK D'ANGELO is seen coming from the interior of the club where Dallas and the Quintet can be seen playing; D'Angelo accosts Robard:",

CAMERA, looking through the windows of Susan's bedroom, sees the door fly open as Hunsecker bursts into the room.  He looks swiftly around, advances towards the open window. Exasperated by the sound of the gramaphone, he switches it off; he steps out onto the terrace.  CAMERA PANS with him as he turns to look back into the study where Susan's inanimate figure is sprawled on the floor, half across the low upholstered footstool.
