THE MATRIX

FADE IN:

INT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL - NIGHT

The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way
across the polyester carpeting, destroying several
rooms as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling.

TRINITY
(V.O.)
I know why you're here, Neo.

We MOVE CLOSER, closing in as the monitor seems to
rush at us, DIVING INTO the computer screen.

CUT TO:

INT. ROOM 303 - NIGHT

TRINITY is a beautiful woman in black leather.

TRINITY
I know what you've been doing.
I know why you hardly sleep,
why you live alone and why,
night after night, you sit
at your computer.

She walks to the window.

TRINITY (CONT'D)
You're looking for him.

ANGLE ON NEO

NEO, a man in his early thirties, watches her intently.

NEO
Who?

TRINITY
You know who I'm talking about.

NEO
Morpheus.

TRINITY
(smiling)
Yes. I know you think you're
looking for him, but he's
looking for you.

CLOSE ON NEO'S FACE

Confusion and hope battle in his expression.

EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

The city sprawls endlessly under a starless sky.

FADE OUT.
