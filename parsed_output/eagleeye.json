      "content": "FADE IN: EXT. DESERT DUNES - DAWN CLOSE ON A WOODEN STICK-FIGURE TOY, held by a SIX YEAR OLD BOY. Another BOY grabs the toy away and RUNS OFF, laughing -- CHILDREN are playing under a cluster of date palms, part of a small desert commune somewhere in the Middle East. Their MOTHERS, veiled in black, gather and talk. Bearded, turbaned MEN carrying AK-47's argue politics. A domestic, even tranquil scene of life in another part of the world... EXT. DESERT ROAD - CONTINUOUS A CARAVAN of VEHICLES RACE DOWN A HIGHWAY:. SUV's mounted with surface-to-air RPG's form a protective cordon around a BLACK MERCEDES. As the cars ROAR INTO LENS, we go.to: EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN POV THOUGH A LONG-RANGE SCOPE: the caravan as seen by a TWO-MAN SPECIAL OPS TEAM perched on a ridge. As the LEADER surveils the cars, his partner finishes assembling a two-foot UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), rigging it with EXPLOSIVES: SPECIAL FORCES LEADER We have visual onthetarget. Confirm 'go' for UAV launch. INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT SUPER: \"JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER, THE PENTAGON\" Sat-feeds monitor the caravan. Military brass observes: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GEOFF CALLISTER (50's, African American; eyes with soul and a wary intelligence). Beside him: COLONEL THOMPSON (Full-Bird, decorated). COLONEL THOMPSON Alpha One, you're confirmed 'go': active UAV at GPS papa, zulu, three, zero. EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN The Ops Team activates a remote transmitter, LAUNCHING the UAV into the sky like a small ROCKET -- amazingly, its silent. INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - CONTINUOUS An airborne feed from the UAV shows it descending on the caravan. A PENTAGON TECHIE manipulates a JOY STICK, controlling the drone from 6500 miles away: PENTAGON TECHIE #1 We have system control. 3/28/07 2 CONTINUED: COLONEL THOMPSON Activate laser mic. EXT. SKIES OVER DESERT - CONTINUOUS DRONE POV: tracking the caravan, singling out the MERCEDES. The drone emits a THIN LASER BEAM that hits its rear windshield -- INT. THE PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY Over speakers, VOICES speak \"Balochi.\" A TRANSLATOR listens: CALLISTER Is it him? TRANSLATOR Four males, one of them's speaking with a.. I think it's a Rakhshaniadialect, consistent with our intel on Al=Khoei. COLONEL THOMPSON Gimme voiceprint analysis. The screen pops to an AUDIO WAVEFORM of the conversation. VOICEPRINT ANALYSIS finishes, the; screen shows a FILE PHOTO of a BEARDED MAN: \"37% PROBABLE MATCH = ID AL-KHOEI.\" CALLISTER I'm not taking 37% to-the President... John, weigh in here? He looks to a plasma: the PRESIDENT'S CABINET is assembled via teleconference from the White House Situation Room: DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CIA and NCTC concur this is the target based on reliable Intel from the Brits. WHIP TO another monitor: the caravan starts to VEER off-road. TECHIE Sire they're pulling off the highway. TECHIE #2 We have abort recommendation. The ANALYSIS ARRAY reads: \"RECOINDATION: ABORT MISSION.\" The source of this recommendation, for now, remains a mystery. COLONEL THOMPSON If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding once in a lifetime, we can't let him go. CALLISTER Alright, stay with him... 3/28/07 3 CONTINUED: THE SATELLITE VIEW shows the caravan approaching the commune. EXT. DESERT COMMUNE - DAY Mothers grab up their children and pull them aside as the vehicles arrive. ARMED MEN emerge... INTERCUTTING - THE PENTAGON OPS ROOM: the computer pinpoints DOTS on the satellite feed that represent WEAPONRY on-site -- TECHIE We've got AK-47's, RPC's, Chaparral guided missiles -- COLONEL THOMPSON Looks like a training camp. THE DESERT: Bodyguards cluster around a TURBANED:MAN as he emerges from the Mercedes. It looks a lot like the man from the file photo, but the beard makes it hard to confirm. MID-AIR WITH THE UAV: It SWOOPS, targeting the man -- SNAP: THE PENTAGON: a BLURRY SNAPSHOT of his FACE appears. A DIGITAL WIRE-FRAME is overlaid on the man's face: \"5I$ PROBABLE MATCH - INSUFFICIENT DATA. RECOMMENDATION: ABORT MISSION.\" TECHIE 51%. 'Abort' rec holds. THE DESERT: Now our guy DISAPPEARS into the crowd as they begin MOVING toward a large WOODEN PLANK on the desert floor. Some of the men take hold of the plank, drag it back to reveal... a PIT. THE PENTAGON: SAME IMAGE in real-time on the feeds: CALLISTER What is that, a weapons cache? ANALYST Sir, the placement of stones around the pit, markers for the Five Pillars of Islam... I think it's a funeral. Everyone trades looks -- this just got even more complicated. THE DESERT: from the back of a TENTED TRUCK, a BODY is lifted, shrouded in white. The men carry it through blowing sand... the procession stopping at the pit. They begin lowering the body... THE PENTAGON: on monitors, a section of the GENEVA CONVENTION SCROLLS: TECHIE Sir, striking a funeral would put us in violation of the Geneva convention. 3/28/07 4. CONTINUED: COLONEL THOMPSON Once this guy's gone, he's gone. The PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL pipes in -- PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL \"Hors de Combat\" -- legally we'd be open to international prosecution. But we have no independent intel verifying it's in fact a funeral, and the presence of weapons certainly leaves room for interpretation. TECHIE #2 I have POTUS calling from Air Force One. CALLISTER (a beat, looks around). Everyone agree this is the best course of action? No one dissents. Callister picks up: CALLISTER (CONT'D) Mr. President, we have.a.51% identity match on Majid Al-Khoei. There is some possibility he's at a funeral, but we don't know. Regardless, counsel thinks we can claim 'Overriding Legal Authority.' Also, you should be aware we have an abort recommendation, but your cabinet, the Speaker, the Joint Chiefs urge a 'go.' THE PRESIDENT (V.0.) You left yourself out of the lineup. Callister pauses. AS THE MESSAGE ON THE MONITOR STARTS BLINKING: \"ABORT, ABORT, ABORT...\" CALLISTER Yessir... we gauge our strategy by two standards: the highest probability of success with the least amount of collateral damage. At 51% probability, we don't have either one. GENERAL THOMPSON And if it is Al-Khoei and he walks, Sir, we're putting our people at risk. There's a long silence as the President considers. 3/28/07 5. CONTINUED: ( 2) THE PRESIDENT (V.0.) I respect your caution, Geoff, but we won't get another chance like this... you have a green light. Callister's obviously opposed, but he bites his tongue: CALLISTER Understood. We're weapons free. And with deadly calm, Techies execute orders into-headsets: TECHIE TECHIE 2 -- Switching to Tac-2, -- MTS active, painting the acquisition's good -- target -- EXT. DESERT - FUNERAL - DAWN The women begin to SING the \"Nasheen,\" a.funeral song praising Allah. The beautiful VOICES grow until all other sound is GONE. DRONE POV: the feed from the CAMERA INSIDE THE NOSE-CONE as it LAUNCHES its missile -- it ZOOMS toward the funeral gathering -- The haunting, beautiful voices WAIL... in the moment before impact, we see: birds flying across the great plain... a herd of running gazelles... the DESERT WIND blankets a layer of sand over the shrouded body in the pit... a CHILD'S HAND grasping his mother's... A WHITE FLASH AS THE MISSILE HITS: HOLD IN WHITE: CREDIT SE UENCE: WORDS CLOSE UP... a digitized electronic scan, as if they're being analyzed by someone: \"We the people of the United States... more perfect union...\" Highlights of The Constitution, The. Declaration of Independence... We land on: \"...whenever any form of government becomes destructive...it is the right of the people to alter it or to abolish it...\" CLOSE IN on these last words: \"ABOLISH IT.\" WHITEWASH: INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT We're looking at a DIGITAL TIMER ticking down crucial seconds -- then a MAN's FACE, intense, focused on something below screen: this is JERRY SHAW, 30, handsome, roguish. Somewhere between an adult and a child -- under his breath: JERRY damnit... 3/28/07 6. CONTINUED: VOICE (O.S.) You gotta make a choice. You gotta move-- JERRY -- I know. VOICE (O.S.) Now. Who are you gonna be? So Jerry makes his move, which we see is SLAMMING down a PLAYING CARD representing a group of DWARVES. He sits across from KWAME, 17. They're playing a geeky role-playing CARD and DICE game, CASH on the table. JERRY KWAME there. Dwarves?: Bullshit -- Bullshit? I just blocked your ass and attacked with (checks card) Ancient Mastery points. --.dwarves don't have that -- -- read the oracle text, my friend. -- shit A thick-mascara/black lipstick BECKY enters, removing her SMOCK: BECKY You know what would be great? If you guys took a longer break. That'd be awesome. JERRY Hey, Becky? When're you going to start wearing makeup? Kwame laughs as Becky tosses her smock at Jerry: BECKY .The collator's broken. JERRY Dude: no its not. BECKY Oh yeah it is, dude! She heads out as Jerry collects the cash. Kwame puts on his own smock as Jerry offers him a quick lesson: JERRY Your first mistake? Underestimating dwarves. Power can come from anywhere -- tomorrow night I'll give you first roll and a bonus pack if y-- 3/28/07 7. CONTINUED: ( 2) KWAME I'm not gonna be here tomorrow, remember? I'm going to Cornell. And Jerry stops. A hit to the solar plexus. Wherever we are, this kid's off to a bright future. But not Jerry. JERRY That -- wow. Good for you. So it's your last night. You're gonna spend it collating. KWAME -- what? But she said the collator's broken. JERRY And that's why we have those rubber thimbles in the drawer --.congratulations on Cornell, though, that's huge! TRACK WITH HIM out to... A COUNTER AREA as, he pins on his NAMETAG: \"JERRY.\" Rows of COPY MACHINES and COMPUTER CUBICLES. He takes his place behind a register. Smiles, getting it up: JERRY (CONT'D) Welcome to Kinko's, how can I help you? The CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK sound of the machines gets louder and louder as they BECOME THE SOUND OF: INT. \"EL\" SUBWAY CAR - MORNING The KRAK-KRAK-KRACKING SUBWAY. We glimpse people looking at their BLACKBERRYS. Talking on CELL PHONES. Listening to IPODS and playing GAME BOYS. The NEWS plays on an LCD mounted on the train wall. A society lost in an \"electronic elsewhere.\" And JERRY, with a SKETCH PAD in his lap. A surprisingly good pencil rendering of the face of a LARGE DOG -- weird, but he's got talent. The TV disturbs his concentration -- news footage of BOMBED-OUT EMBASSIES, emergency vehicles, wounded victims: SHEPARD SMITH a heightened terror alert due to a series of suicide bombings, believed to be in retaliation for a deadly attack outside Abadan that killed forty people. Though the White House has denied involvement, Shia leaders have denounced the U.S. as responsible... AL-JAZEERA FOOTAGE: A SHIA SPOKESMAN is translated into ENGLISH: 3/28/07 8. CONTINUED: SPOKESMAN Your embassies were only the beginning! Our warriors are already within your borders. Until American leadership is removed from power, Allah's revenge is upon you! And during all this, Jerry notices something: people are glancing at each other aranoid. What a fucking world... EXT. ATM MACHINE - MORNING An ATM CARD gets slid into the slot. Jerry looks up. THE ATM CAMERA IS STARING RIGHT AT HIM. Then, a BEEP gets his attention: \"INSUFFICIENT FUNDS.\" He processes this a moment... his exhale doesn't just say, \"FUCK,\" it says \"FUCK 1 KNEW IT.\" INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY .-MORNING Saying it's a modest place would be kind. Jerry opens his mailbox. Just BILLS, some of which will:go unpaid this month. A BEAT as he shoves them back in and we HARD CUT TO: INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MORNING A DOOR OPENS: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI, Jerry's elderly Polish landlady. Pleased to see him, but painfully annoyed to know what's coming: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Jerry. JERRY Whatever are you cooking right now? Is the greatest thing I've ever smelled in my life, I swear to God -- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI is schab wieprzowy po polsku -- you have the rent, yes? JERRY -- here's some of it -- most of it -- but I've got something else for you... something special... Eyebrows bobbing. Mrs. Wierzbowsky knows exactly what it is. Sighs. Knows she can't resist him -- INT. KITCHEN - MRS. WIERZBOWSKI'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER CLOSE ON Jerry pushing a THUMB TAC into the dog sketch we saw him doing on the subway. PULL BACK to reveal about 25 other sketches on the wall. All of the same dog. The actual DOG, Johann, lies underneath the kitchen table. 9. 3/28/07 CONTINUED: JERRY So I think. No, I'm pretty sure that's the best one so far --- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Yes. Is good -- rent is better. She puts a bowl of STEW into Jerry's hands. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D) You are hungry, I am guessing. JERRY Oh, no, no. I couldn't -- Unless, you know, you insist. He sits at the table, starts eating. This is their routine. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI So where is girl? I don't see her? JERRY Oh, the redhead? No. She... that's over. She got smart. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Like the others. JERRY Well, womenareIpretty smart. I've discovered. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI You are like Johann. Jerry stops eating, mouth full. As Johann looks up. JERRY Your -- I'm like your dog? MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Look at him. Is big dog. Labrador. But he believe... he is terrier. So is Labrador... but no labrador. Somehow Jerry can't get his eyes off Johann. Quietly: JERRY why do you think that is? As she pours a drink into a plastic cup -- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Perhaps many things. When I rescue Johann from pound, they say he was abuse. (MC)RF ) 3/28/07 10. CONTINUED: (2) MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D) As puppy. They kick him when baby, make him feel not big. You need someone for rescuing you. Jerry looks at her, sad-smiles. Takes a sip and holy shit: JERRY This is -- vodka -- Jesus, its eight- thirty in the morning -- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI -- you cannot eat bigos without vodka. Adjusting to it, Jerry drinks again -- as his CELL PHONE RINGS. He looks at his phone, freezing. Mrs. Wierzbowski notices. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D) Is the girl? Answer. Tell her you'. are Labrador. Then ask if she give you money for rent. But we've PUSHED IN on Jerry, who stares at the name on the phone. Something's affecting him deeply. He says, quietly: JERRY its my mother. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Is problem? JERRY is problem. INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER Jerry steps outside as the phone keeps RINGING, debating: WHAT TO DO. Finally, he answers, as if ready for punishment: JERRY Hey, mom... Jerry stands there in silhouette. LISTENING. Something is happening... .suddenly he loses his balance -- sinks to the floor, phone to his ear -- staring in pain -- EXT. CHURCH - DAY MOURNERS are gathering in their somber best, shaking hands. Across the street, we find Jerry, getting out of a taxi. Standing in a rumpled suit. Grim; the last thing he wants to do is enter that church. It's almost as if he can't. Finally, from somewhere, strength. He walks forward. 3/28/07 11. INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS Jerry heads down the aisle, painfully self-conscious. Most of the MOURNERS are in the pews, turning to look at him as he passes. When suddenly there's a SCREAM OF TERROR -- and Jerry BRACES as if he was expecting it -- looks over at a WOMAN pointing like he was a fucking bodysnatcher and she collapses -- Jerry holds up his hands as everyone turns to look at him-- JERRY -- no! I-- I'm not him! All eyes on him. His voice, sad, heartbroken: JERRY (CONT'D) It's okay! I'm not Paul! Locks eyes with his MOTHER and FATHER up in the front pew. Their eyes red from crying, withered shells. And Jerry gives a lame wave before heading reluctantly up to the COFFIN. Devastated, he leans in -- and we MOVE AROUND to see the body: And it's fucking HIM -- Jerry's very own face, but one that seems to have been RECONSTRUCTED after some kind of accident. Gruesome and handsome all at once. This was PAUL SHAW. Jerry's identical twin. Off the surreal moment... A reverbed TRUMPET PLAYS, the tune familiar. In fact, it's: INT. APARTMENT - DAY THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, booming from a trumpet played by an 8 year- old boy: KYLE HOLLOMAN. A WOMAN blurs into frame: RACHEL HOLLOMAN, searching for car keys. 28, smart, beautiful, but fiercely independent, she's a single mom who's taken life's knocks. Never as cool-headed as she wants to be, she's on a short fuse with everyone but Kyle, whom she adores: RACHEL Okayokay... okay: we came home, put down the leftovers, you turned on the TV, I went over, I said no TV-- She turns to the TV area and walks straight INTO a table. Stuns her, momentarily, but she doesn't break stride -- KYLE -- we're gonna be late, huh? RACHEL -- absolutely not -- I turned it off, came over here, checked messages, put the leftovers in the-- 3/28/07 12. CONTINUED: KYLE RACHEL --knocked over the phone-- --right, knocked over the phone, put it back, put the food in the fridge-- She opens the fridge: HER KEYS sit atop a Tupperware container. Kyle hits a high note and we SLAM TO: INT. RACHEL'S CAR - MORNING The KEY turning in the ignition of a crappy, old Honda. The engine CHOKES, SPUTTERS. Rachel's tense-- RACHEL we need to get a new car -- KYLE I like your car. We're gonna be late. The engine still SPLIT-SPUT-SPUTTERING.::.. a BUS. whizzes by, slows up ahead at a bus stop. Rachel gives up, jumps out: RACHEL No we're not: the bus. KYLE -- are you kidding? EXT. CITY STREET - DAY Rachel and Kyle HAUL ASS toward the bus stop, both struggling with Kyle's carry-on, a.garment bag, her purse, and a trumpet case marked with STICKERS (Green Bay Packers among them)-- RACHEL I put vitamins in your toiletry bag, don't forget to take two in the morning -- KYLE and one at night, I know -- RACHEL And your inhaler, which I may need to use now, is in the outside pocket -- wait! They rush back to a MAILBOX, she pulls bills from her purse: KYLE More bills? RACHEL Yup -- that's what happens when you have a kid on lay-away. They smile at each other. When SUDDENLY a BUS ROARS PAST the WIND GUSTS and the bills go FLYING into traffic: 3/28/07 13 CONTINUED: RACHEL (CONT'D) OH, SHIT! STAY HERE! Rachel waves her arms at oncoming cars, runs INTO TRAFFIC-- KYLE YOU SWORE!! As she chases the bills, SCREECHING and HONKING around her: RACHEL I KNOW, I'M SORRY! (Porsche HONKS as it PASSES) HEY, A LITTLE COMMON COURTESY, ASSHOLE! And she runs back to Kyle, THROWS the bills in the mailbox -- KYLE You swore again. Was that our bus? Rachel looks: PAN to across the street, the bus is now LEAVING THE BUS STOP. PAN back to Rachel: SHIT!! RACHEL: Okay, now were gonna.be late. She puts fingers in her mouth and WHISTLES HARD for a cab -- INT. TRAIN STATION - WISCONSIN - DAY A CLASS OF MUSIC STUDENTS boards and Amtrak train. Rachel and Kyle are RUNNING through the crowd toward them -- RACHEL Scuze us, coming through, sorry -- WAIT!! WAIT!! Finally they arrive. Kyle's teacher, MRS. MILLER, smiles: MRS. MILLER Under the wire -- RACHEL Hi -- sorry -- Rachel Holloman, we met-- MRS. MILLER -- of course, Barbara Miller. You should probably -- And Rachel's stomach drops. Knows they've been racing towards this moment all morning but still not willing to accept it. Turning Kyle to face her -- 3/28/07 14. CONTINUED: RACHEL Okay. Now. I want you to have an awesome time -- KYLE I will, mom -- RACHEL -- you can eat junk food, just remember to brush your teeth; and if you're gonna goof off, just be really smart about it; and try not to stay up past your bedtime, you get really cranky when you do that'-- He gets very contrarian if he doesn't get at least eight -- MRS. MILLER I'm afraid it's time to board, Mrs. Holloman. Tears springing to Rachel's eyes. She tries to hide them. Bending down to be eye to eye with her son. Sotto -- RACHEL You see all these kids? They're all calling their mothers. You just do it more -- KYLE It's only two days,: mom. Y'know... you could try and some have fun too, wouldn't kill ya.. RACHEL Fun? What's that? I love you so much, baby.You're my everything. Rock the house. KYLE -- love you too -- They separate -- she watches as Kyle boards with Mrs. Miller: RACHEL Call me! MRS. MILLER Your mom gonna be okay? KYLE It's unclear. As they head into the train, Rachel steels herself and GOES. Passing the BAGGAGE AREA... 3/28/07 15. CONTINUED: (2) We HOLD as the PORTER places Kyle's TRUMPET CASE on a conveyor belt. Oddly, it's ELECTRONICALLY REDIRECTED AWAY FROM THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS -- down a separate belt, where it emerges in a pick- up turnstile. Its lifted off the track by... A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN. Nervous. Really nervous. And the strangest thing -- he touches his ear and MURMURS something in Tajiki. To no one. Like a crazy person. What the hell? Walks to the curb where his white van idles. On the side is a decal: \"HASSAD DRY CLEANERS.\" Loads the trumpet inside as we: INT. SHAW HOME - AFTERNOON Solemn quiet. Mourners talking in hushed tones. A buffet. Old people. Children. And over these shots, WHISPERED VOICES: WOMAN #1 (V.O.) you didn't know either? WOMAN #2 (V.0.) No idea. WOMAN #3 (V.0.) I knew he had a brother. But not a twin, that was... WOMAN.#1 (V.0.) I know, I know... Four WOMEN sit together. Heartbroken, unsettled. One glances across into a sitting room, where Jerry sits alone on a sofa. We're CLOSE on Jerry now. Holding a glass, etched with hearts. Looking at it as if it means something. Somehow, his childhood. He looks up at the stairs, as if knowing he needs to go up there. So he does. We MOVE with him: WOMAN #1 (CCNT'D) when was the last time they saw him? WOMAN #2 Margaret said years... INT. SHAW HOUSE - PAUL AND JERRY'S ROOM - DAY TROPHIES. RIBBONS. All of them awarded to PAUL SHAW. TIGHT on Jerry's face as he scans the shelves of evidence. Evidence that he had a brother. A superior brother. Again and again we see: PAUL SHAW. PAUL SHAW. PAUL. PAUL. Then Jerry finds one framed CERTIFICATE. In the back. A Junior High ART PRIZE. Awarded to JERRY SHAW. He smiles at the fucking absurdity of it as a figure appears behind him... 3/28/07 16. CONTINUED: It's WILLIAM. Their father. The worst day of this man's life. Jerry composes himself quickly. They stare for a moment. WILLIAM Six months without a boo or a bah. JERRY Didn't realize it'd been that long. WILLIAM Your mom was worried. So where were you this time? JERRY Nowhere. Singapore. Alaska for a few weeks. got a job for a while. On a...fishing boat. Met some great p- WILLIAM -- that's nice. Looks like you're really seeing the world. JERRY I'm trying, you know, just to -- But William has just started crying.. Sobs of absolute loss. Jerry stands there, frozen, until William EMBRACES HIM. Jerry hugs him back -- tightly, grateful and starting to feel again. And just then, William says, quietly, through tears: WILLIAM You sound just like him. Jerry's eyes find a point in space. This is love by proxy. And now he hugs, his father in support, not unity. William pulls back. Takes his wallet from his pocket: WILLIAM (CONT'D) I want to give you some, uh... JERRY No. -- Dad, I'm okay. I'm doing really well. I promise. His father holds out some bills. North of two-hundred dollars. It's a stand-off. The question is: does Jerry have enough pride to reject the offer? And the answer is... EXT. CHICAGO STREET - ATM MACHINE - DAY CLOSE ON THE PIN NUMBER AGAIN, getting PUNCHED IN. Then FIND JERRY, exhausted from the funeral, slipping the money his father gave him into a deposit envelope. A glance at the SECURITY CAMERA. Then a BEEP makes him look at the screen. 3/28/07 17 CONTINUED: AND WE PUNCH IN TIGHTER ON JERRY, WHO STARES, STUNNED. The screen reads: \"BALANCE: $750,000.00\" What the HELL? Glances back to the people behind him, they want him to hurry. He hits \"Cancel.\" But the machine, as if disobeying, spits out five $100 bills-- JERRY -- whoa -- Jerry stabs cancel again. Now TEN MORE $100 bills-come out. He glances at the people in line, nervous-- JERRY (CONT'D) -- two seconds, sorry -- Eyes flick back to the ATM CAMERA. He covers it with his hand, pushes \"cancel\" again and again. But now.. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN $100 BILLS HAS COME OUT, getting JAMMED' in the slot. People start to PEER OVER as Jerry SCRAMBLES to keep the cash from flying everywhere. And finally. The machine stops. He stuffs all the money in his pocket. Everyone's staring. JERRY (CONT'D) Big date. So... fingers crossed. INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING.- HALLWAY - NIGHT Jerry enters, a little dazed -- heads for his apartment as Mrs. Wierzbowski steps from. hers, Johann hiding behind her: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Jerry! All day they make delivery! Jerry moves fast to her, a little out of breath -- shoves a thousand dollars into her hand: JERRY Here's the rest of the rent -- next month's, too -- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI -- where do you get this? JERRY Just take it -- it's okay, I owe you -- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI I had to open your apartment, too many packages come, they come for hours -- JERRY For me? 3/28/07 18. INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Jerry whips open his apartment door -- as far as he can: it's blocked by something. He reaches in, flips on the LIGHT: BOXES EVERYWHERE. Reeling, he picks one up, rips it open. Packing peanuts fly: a pair of night-vision binoculars. WHAT IS HAPPENING? Goes through more boxes in a flurry of CUTS: FALSE PASSPORTS; a POLICE SCANNER; BODY ARMOR; HAND GUNS; large BAGS OF FERTILIZER; strange CHEMICALS; 747 MANUALS. Jerry looks around, fear and confusion growing. His cell rings.,. startles him -- all the LCD says is: \"ANSWER NOW.\" JERRY -- hello? A WOMAN'S VOICE. We can't place why... but it's really creepy. WOMAN'S VOICE Look out your window. They're coming for you. JERRY -- what? Who is this? WOMAN'S VOICE Jerry. You have to run. JERRY Who the hell is this?! Rips back the curtain to see a SWAT VAN SCREECHING UP -- a flack- jacketed TEAM pours out, assault rifles ready. Jerry goes pale. WOMAN'S VOICE Leave your residence. Get to the Mathis train station. You have 4 minutes. JERRY Jesus Christ -- what's happening?! WOMAN'S VOICE Run, or you'll be captured and convicted -- go NOW. CLICK. POUNDING BOOTS AGAINST PAVEMENT OUTSIDE. Jerry whirls, goes out to the hall, hears THEM coming. Starts to run. But a TACTICAL TEAM STORMS THE HALL. ASSAULT RIFLES AIMED AT HIM: TEAM LEADER JERRY Hands behind your head! DOWN WHAT'S GOING ON? HEY! IS NOW! DOWN ON THE FLOOR OR WE THIS ABOUT THE--THE ATM?! I WILL FIRE! DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! Jerry's SLAMMED to the ground as we CUT TO -- 3/28/07 19. INT. DHS FIELD OFFICE - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT Jerry sits cuffed to a table. Frightened, confused, on the defensive. The door opens and AGENT THOMAS MORGAN enters: 40s, born to the job, never smiles. Takes a seat, opens a \"file: JERRY Look, man, I don't know what this is -- I don't know how all that shit got in my apartment, but unless you're my lawyer-- MORGAN My condolences.

And if you knew Paul, which you did not, you'd laugh all day at the idea that he was a spy or terrorist or whatever you're implying -- RACHEL I'm implying if not him... then why you? JERRY Well hasn't that been the question my whole life. You know how I know Paul wasn't a terrorist? Because if he had been, he would've been the best fucking terrorist in history: he wouldn't have gotten caught, the United States would be a crater -- he would've won awards for being a great terrorist. What about you? Why'd she choose you -- what's your day job? I know it isn't \"manual-shift driver.\" 3/28/07 41. CONTINUED: (2) RACHEL I did just fine driving, thanks. I'm a paralegal -- I have no connection to anything. JERRY Really? Suddenly they're interrupted by the ROOSTERTAIL OF DUST approaching in the distance. Rachel stops dead and on INSTINCT, grabs Jerry's hand, all their mutual hostility vanished: RACHEL Someone's coming. And what's approaching is the \"Hassad DryCleaners.\" van. It comes to a stop and out steps the Middle Eastern Man. Stands some twenty-five feet from them. MIDDLE EASTERN MAN Are you Jerry Shaw? JERRY who are you? Rachel grabs Jerry's arm as the man reaches into his jacket -- JERRY (CONT'D) MIDDLE EASTERN MAN -- Whoa -- I dropped it off like she said. I'm done. The man's pulled out an unusual-looking STEEL KEY. JERRY (CONT'D) -- dropped off what? Who are you? MIDDLE EASTERN MAN Take it -- He TOSSES the key..-- it lands, LARGE IN FRAME, somewhere between them. Then: JERRY what's it for? MIDDLE EASTERN MAN I don't know -- I don't care -- but I will not drive you. You take the van I'm not listening to you any more! And the man turns to go, just walks away. RACHEL JERRY -- hey! -- wait, who are you?! You have to tell us what you know! 3/28/07 42 CONTINUED: (3) And as the man walks away from them his CELL PHONE RINGS: He pulls it out -- the LCD READS: \"LAST CHANCE.\" And the man DROPS the phone and just starts RUNNING -- JERRY WAIT!! And Jerry takes off after him, he's not letting him go. Catches up to the guy and grabs him. Spinning him round -- JERRY (CONT'D) What do you know? MIDDLE EASTERN MAN -- let me go! JERRY -- who's doing this? And they begin to struggle. Middle Eastern Man's dropped CELL PHONE RINGS. Rachel. Terrified, hesitant. Knows somehow its for her -- she answers: WOMAN'S VOICE Stop him now or he will die. RACHEL How are you seeing us?! Jerry and the Middle Eastern Man. Fighting. Thrashing. Throwing sloppy punches: MIDDLE EASTERN MAN Let go of me! On Rachel: WOMAN'S VOICE Stop him now. CLICK. Rachel turning to SCREAM at Middle Eastern Man -- RACHEL Stop! You have to STOP! When the Middle Eastern Man CRACKS Jerry in the nose and he goes sprawling. He takes off again, yelling back: MIDDLE EASTERN MAN I cannot! I have a family!!! RACHEL She's going to KILL YOU! 3/28/07 43. CONTINUED: (4) And just then, something TERRIFYING: an IMMENSE POWER SURGE -- HEARD, FELT -- and a SIX-STORY-HIGH COIL THE SIZE OF AN SUV EXPLODES IN SPARKS. CABLES BLAST FREE. Rachel SCREAMS. Jerry TACKLES HER TO SAFETY as the tree trunk cables SWING DOWN AND STRIKE THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN and he is SLAMMED OFF HIS FEET, the current making the cable STICK TO HIM LIKE GLUE. And he's ON FIRE INSTANTLY -- SMOKE EVERYWHERE as he's TOSSED BY THE HORRIFYING TENTACLE, POUNDED INTO THE GROUND, BACK INTO THE AIR, PUMMELLED DOWN AGAIN, BURNING... Jerry and Rachel watch this in horror -- until she looks away. Jerry holding her -- the two in shock, strangers, in each - other's arms. Having shared another moment, too real, horror - RACHEL (CONT'D) JERRY. Oh my God... Oh God... oh We--we have to do something, God... Oh God... we have to... figure out what to.. what... And then his PHONE RINGS. And they're both too afraid to answer it. Another RING. And another. Finally Jerry answers it, hand shaking slightly: JERRY You killed him... you killed that man... WOMAN'S VOICE It was unavoidable. Take the van. Drive to Indianapolis. 7002 West 56th Street. Arrive no later than eleven AM. Disobey and you die. CLICK. Rachel's eyes on Jerry. JERRY RACHEL she wants us to drive to Indianapolis.: , -- why? What's there, what? -- -- I don't know -- -- no, this can't keep happening! We have to go to the police, explain it -- explain what?! What're we -- I'm not doing it!! I'm not gonna tell them?! going anywhere! Jerry can see she's losing it. Grabs her by the shoulders: JERRY -- Rachel. She's watching us. Right now. You wanna die too? Your son? We have to go. Rachel looks right at him, still shaking, knows he's right. And nods. Okay. Okay. As our MUSIC BUILDS, LARGER THAN YOU MIGHT THINK -- AND AT THE HEIGHT OF AN UNRESOLVED CHORD, IT -- 3/28/07 44. EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY -- STOPS. Just the eerie, faint whistle of wind. We PAN a barren landscape. Scattered scorch marks. Then, a high-pitched TONE as the PAN continues and arrives at a parked military truck, which gives us scale to understand the SUDDEN COLOSSAL EXPLOSION THAT SHAKES OUR BEING -- HOLY FUCK THAT THING WAS HUGE AND AS DEBRIS IS STILL RIPPED INTO THE SKY, PIECES ARE COMING DOWN AND THERE WILL BE SMOKE FOR HOURS as a SUPER APPEARS: \"BRIAR POINT TEST RANGE -- ABERDEEN, MARYLAND. \"- And we hear CLAPPING -- PULL BACK, realizing that we are inside: INT. PROTECTIVE BARRACKS - DAY -- a high-tech bunker-like structure with six-inch LEXAN WINDOWS. A dozen MILITARY BRASS are here, applauding. Among them is Callister. He seems more thoughtful about this. Behind him, a British, DARK-SUITED WEAPONS';DEVELOPER speaks: WEAPONS DEVELOPER That blast was the result of one single crystal of Hexomethylne. For those of you who are new today, \"Rex\" is an isotope that leaves no chemical markers -- it's eighty times more powerful than C4. Odorless. Undetectable. COLONEL THOMPSON, also from our opening, gestures: COLONEL THOMPSON Talk about the detonating system... The Developer screws a METAL VALVE into what looks like a can of compressed air, saying: WEAPONS DEVELOPER Hex is triggered by an acoustic frequency undetectable to the human ear. For this test we made it audible -- that was the tone you heard before the explosion -- the tone was the trigger. CALLISTER What's the risk that another sound could accidentally detonate it? A song on a radio? A howling dog? WEAPONS DEVELOPER No: the pitch is uniquely programmed and impossible to reproduce. 3/28/07 45 CONTINUED: COLONEL THOMPSON Fine job. WEAPONS DEVELOPER Thank you, sir. We're proud of this ordnance -- all of us at Halloway-Smith. And while we still HEAR HIM SPEAKING, we CUT TO: INT.

The arms package each into separate . containers, fit them with shipping labels marked: \"PENTAGON DIRECT.\" WEAPONS DEVELOPER (V.0.) (CONT'D) And we're hoping this moves us into the next scheduled phase... shipping the product into the field. Drift toward an unmanned computer. The screen FLICKERS: \"OVERRIDE IN PROGRESS,. CHANGE SHIPPING DESTINATION.\" Robot arms grab a wrapped package off the line. A new label's printed: \"ASHLAND & SONS CIO JERRY SHAW.\" INT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - DAY Latesha walking down a hallway. Endless miles of shiny marble and military paintings. Her CELL RINGS. It's Morgan: MORGAN (V.O.) Whaddya got? LATESHA Those funny things underneath my not-so- stylish pantsuit?

I've been up and down all the ladders and everyone just thinks I'm a -- WHEN an MP suddenly appears and grabs her by the arm. Stopping her. He towers over her -- MP Interns aren't allowed on this floor, miss. You'll have to -- When Latesha wearily flashes him her I.D. I've got clearance, pal. He looks at it. Lets her arm go.

A HUGE:PAINTING of the battle of EL-ALAMEIN looming behind her. Shelooks..back down the hallway as all the BRASS heading into the MEETING ROOM and catches sight of -- CALLISTER amongst them. Latesha hesitates. For just a second. Shit. Shit. This is it. Before suddenly rushing forward and calling out -- LATESHA Secretary Callister!.: He looks behind him briefly before being shuffled into the meeting room. And SLAM.. The doors close in Latesha's face. LATESHA (CONT'D) Well, shit. INT. DRY CLEANING VAN - CITY STREETS - INDIANAPOLIS - DAY The van speeds down a highway, passing a sign: \"WELCOME TO INDIANAPOLIS: YOUR HOME TOWN!\" Jerry drives, pensive. Rachel stares out the-window, the shock of what she's seen only fueling her rage at the whole situation. JERRY how old is he? Your son. RACHEL Kyle. He's nine. JERRY What's he doing on a train? She really doesn't want to talk. BUT: 3/28/07 48. CONTINUED: RACHEL He goes to a music magnet. His school's on a tour of Washington. They're playing at the Kennedy Center. JERRY wow. And you. Hm.

RACHEL Then what's with the qualified nod? JERRY I'm not allowed to nod? RACHEL Not if you're iudging me.-- JERRY. Judging?! I'm just making conversation. RACHEL You think I should have gone with him anyway. JERRY I'm just thinking, sounds like a big deal, especially for a 9-year-old -- playing at the Kennedy Center -- I'd just think at least one parent might wanna be there to see it. RACHEL Yeah? How do you know Kyle's dad isn't there? JERRY Well, you're not wearing a ring and you haven't mentioned anyone but your son is on that train. Even the most pissed off ex-wife -- which I'm not saying you aren't -- would've mentioned it if her ex's life was threatened -- and if Kyle was going to meet his dad in DC? You would've tried to call him, too. So where is he? Kyle's dad? 3/28/07 49. CONTINUED: (2) RACHEL As if it's any of your business -- you know what you are --? JERRY Insightful? Intuitive? A better driver than you --? RACHEL -- you're one of those \"thirties are the new twenties\" man-children.

Jerry YANKS the wheel hard, PEELING across four lanes of traffic. SKIDS to a stop by a curb, pops open the door. RACHEL JESUS!--WHAT'RE YOU D--?'. Jerry gets out, SLAMS his door shut -- 3/28/07 50. CONTINUED: (3) RACHEL (CONT'D) You can't leave me! JERRY Why not? My brother's a terrorist, and I'm a loser right? He starts to walk away. Rachel desperately opening her door RACHEL Don't walk away! JERRY I'm done. RACHEL Please! JERRY You're on your own. Rachel starts running after him,panicked, leadin : RACHEL Please! PLEASE! I..i need you! Jerrystops short. Turning around. Cupping his ear. JERRY I'm sorry? What'd you just say? RACHEL I can't do this without you. JERRY You mean without the \"man-child?\" Rachel's reserves crumble. RACHEL Its the first time we've been apart, me and Kyle. Since the day he was born. And I let him get on that train-- -- I let him get on. Jerry sees all the panic and horror and guilt in this woman's eyes. They're both in pain. Points his finger right at her. JERRY No more accusing my brother of shit you know nothing about, is that understood? Rachel looks at him. Nods. Finding her voice again -- 3/28/07 51. CONTINUED: (4) RACHEL Yes. And so. They turn around. And get back in the van. EXT. TOWER 108 - DAY THE CHARRED FACE OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN, FROZEN IN A SCREAM. Morgan runs towards it, the SHERIFF and a POWER WORKER trying to keep up. Chopper in B.G. Police officers work the scene. POWER WORKER Never seen anything like it. Power blew out from Franklin High School down to the river club. I can't explain it - They arrive at the body. Contorted, blackened, teeth bared. SHERIFF No I.D. We know he's male, though. Probably in his 20's. Tire treads entering and leaving the scene over three. Three sets of shoe prints. MORGAN And we're about 4 miles from the river -- Just then we see Agent Grant running towards them, stumbling on some rocks. Just finishing-.up a cell call: AGENT GRANT Agent Morgan!\" Just got off with HQ. The fake fax from Justice that got Shaw his phone call? Came from inside Justice. MORGAN Inside?! You absolutely sure on that? AGENT GRANT Yes, s-- Yes I am. MEDICAL EXAMINER Got something -- As the M.E. pulls something out of Middle Eastern Man's ear: a small, charred GIZMO. Small WIRE sticking out. Lifts it up for them to see. Morgan takes the TWEEZERS -- GRANT Looks like a bone mic, military grade. 3/28/07 52. CONTINUED: MORGAN Can't even get these things on the black market. Someone was talking to him. Something's rotten in Denmark. No, something's rotten everywhere. Morgan turns abruptly and starts back for the chopper. The Sheriff helplessly calls after him: SHERIFF We'll be needing that for evidence! EXT. 56TH STREET - DAY Jerry and Rachel's van pulls up to THE FEDERAL BANK OF INDIANAPOLIS. Across the way is a STADIUM for the COLTS. The parking lot's full, mid-game. They stare;.steeling themselves for the inevitable... RACHEL a Federal bank? JERRY Could be worse. Could.be.a Federal Prison. INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE -;LOBBY - DAY A wall-mounted clock ticks to \"11:00\"--WHIP TO Jerry and Rachel entering. Security cams everywhere. As they nervously cross the floor, they pass TWO ARMED BRINKS COURIERS entering an elevator. A BANK MANAGER APPROACHES: MANAGER Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? I'm Mr. Bids. I understand you're in a hurry, why don't I show you to your box. JERRY yes, thank you, we'd... like that. The manager walks them across to a secure elevator with a THERMOGRAPHIC SCANNER. The manager looks at Jerry expectantly, waiting for him to place his hand on it. He does: a flash of light, identifying him as: \"SAXON, CARL.\" Jerry's eyes: this is madness. The elevator doors OPEN. INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - VAULT - DAY They exit the elevator, the manager leads them to a DEPOSIT BOX. He pulls out a metal key, identical to the one the Middle Eastern Man gave Jerry: 3/28/07 53. CONTINUED: MANAGER Your key? Jerry takes out his key, it fits perfectly. They turn; the box slides out, the manager lays it on a steel table. LEAVES to give them privacy. Jerry and Rachel stare at the box. RACHEL You gonna open it? JERRY Maybe it's not gonna be so bad. RACHEL Yeah... maybe it's something good.. They meet eyes. Tentatively, he raises the lid to find TWO GLOCK PISTOLS and the same BONE MIC we saw.the.M.E. pull out of the Middle Eastern Man's ear. A note.: \"EAR:MIC. NOW.\" JERRY RACHEL Oh, shit -- it's bad -- They look at each other. Jerry puts the..mic in his ear: WOMAN'S VOICE OVER MIC Both guns are loaded, safety's off. In sixty seconds,':two,men Will exit the adjacent vault carrying a briefcase. Take it -- by force if necessary -- then exit the building.. Jerry can't fucking believe this. Rachel dying to know: RACHEL -- what?! JERRY -- I don't suppose -- there's any easier way to`get whatever the hell it is you want -- is there? Miss? But she's not answering. JERRY (CONT'D) Excellent.

The footsteps come CLOSER as two MEN appear... the.-BRINKS COURIERS from the lobby; one of them's carrying a METALLIC BRIEFCASE cuffed to his wrist -- the other spots Jerry's gun and REACTS, going for his gun: JERRY Don't! The men freeze -- Jerry holds his gun awkwardly -- JERRY (CONT'D) Uh... hi. How's it going. Put. it on the floor. The briefcase. We don't wanna hurt you guys, we like you guys -- just -- we need the case. COURIER #1 You're bringing a shitstorm on your heads, you know that. JERRY I think we're already mid-shitstorm. Do it. The men exchange glances. Reluctantly, Courier #1 punches a combination into the case's padlock, the cuff POPS free from his wrist. He slides it over to Jerry, who reaches for it... AND COURIER #2 MAKES A MOVE -- SMASHING Jerry back, knocking the gun out of his hand.. Jerry CRASHES to the ground, the BONE MIC falling out of his ear... he turns, shit! Sees it skitter under the table. The Courier sees it too and grabs his chance: snatches up the case and RUNS for the elevator -- Rachel rushes him, trips him -- he falls, dazed -- Jerry leaps up but Courier #2 effortlessly FLIPS him on top of the steel table, SLAMS Jerry's head into the counter, unholsters a back-up GUN from his ankle -- brings the barrel up as: BAM! A GUNSHOT! The Couriers spin to see RACHEL, holding the gun that was kicked across the floor: RACHEL DROP THE GUN ASSHOLE! Courier #2 drops it; Jerry rises, wipes blood from his lip. Rachel is fucking on fire, she's so tough. AKA: a mother. 3/28/07 55. CONTINUED: (3) RACHEL (CONT'D) Gimme the case. Now. They do -- and Jerry and Rachel back into the elevator with it. JERRY RACHEL impressive. Thanks. The door closes on them, and we CUT INTO: INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - ELEVATOR - DAY Alone in the elevator, Jerry looks down at the.. case, adrenaline coursing, sees a ribbon-thin DIGITAL TIMER near the handle: \"01:12:36. 01:12:35.\" RACHEL JERRY -- whoa--what is that? -- a timer -- it's counting down-- -- they do.that -- what's it mean?! -- I dunno, the only things with timers I can think of are microwaves and... -- and bombs, you were gonna say bombs -- some coffee makers have timers.. .and egg timers... -- yeah, Jerry, it's an egg timer -- What is SHE saying about it --? I dunno, I -- -- What do you mean you. don't know?! WOMAN'S VOICE You lost the mic, Jerry. That's not optimum. JESUS CHRIST! Her voice is in the elevator now: JERRY Would you stop doing that?! WOMAN'S VOICE There will thirty five seconds of disconnect, during which you need to get yourselves across the street to the stadium's VIP parking area unexposed. JERRY Is this a bomb?! 'Cause I am not walking out with a bomb! Hey! You! But she's done talking. As the elevator DOORS SLIDE OPEN-- 3/28/07 56 INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - DAY TWO MORE BRINKS COURIERS wait by an armored truck. Jerry and Rachel exit, trying to look casual. Hearts POUNDING -- RACHEL How do I look? JERRY Like you got into a fight. Me? RACHEL Like you lost one. AN ALARM SOUNDS. The men race into the bank as Jerry and Rachel walk RIGHT PAST them, starting across the street toward the stadium. No one in sight except a COLTS PARAPHERNALIA VENDOR. SQUAD CARS SCREECH in around the bank. COPS jump out drawing their weapons. Rachel tensing. JERRY Just keep walking Jerry looks at the CLOCK above the-stadium. Then over his shoulder at the BANK. Steers Rachel over towards the VENDOR. Trying to stay calm. JERRY (CONT'D) Two jerseys and two hats, please -- VENDOR Peyton or Vinatieri? JERRY I don't know what that means -- RACHEL Jerry... JERRY Uh... both. The two COURIERS running out of the bank. POINTING RIGHT AT JERRY AND RACHEL ACROSS THE STREET. Everyone starts RUNNING TOWARD THEM. Jerry shoves a jersey and hat at Rachel-- JERRY (CONT'D) Put these on -- RACHEL JER-- JERRY Do it! 3/28/07 57 CONTINUED: They put on the hats and jerseys, hurrying towards the stadium. Cops screaming at them to stop, the Vendor screaming that they didn't pay. The cops fan out. Cars SCREECH to a stop. Jerry, sweating. Flicks another look at the stadium clock: 3.. 2.. 1: WHEN WHAM! THE STADIUM DOORS FLY OPEN AS THOUSANDS OF JOYOUS COLTS FANS POUR OUT WEARING IDENTICAL BLUE HATS AND JERSEYS. The game's over. And in an instant, Jerry and Rachel are lost in a sea of blue and white -- it's impossible to spot them. Pushed back by the throng the COPS lose sight of them -- Jerry takes Rachel's arm, working against the current towards the VIP parking area. A LIMO WAITING THERE. The CHAUFFEUR sees them, hurriedly puts down his paper. Opening the door -- CHAUFFEUR Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? Hope you-enjoyed the game. JERRY Thanks, uh, we're in kind of a hurry -- CHAUFFEUR I bet. Jerry reacts, confused by the.chauffeur's libidinous tone as he closes the back door. They vanish behind tinted windows as cops and agents pass right by them. And as the limo pulls out, we reveal, etched across the rear: \"JUST MARRIED.\" EXT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - DAY Latesha sits next to the DOUBLE DOORS. Laptop open, typing madly. She's been waiting a long, long time -- WHEN SUDDENLY they burst open and she SNAPS to her feet. Standing expectantly as GENERAL after GENERAL files out of the situation room. Each as tall and broad as the next -- LATESHA Afternoon... afternoon, sir... afternoon... afternoon, General... Pretty intimidating. Finally CALLISTER walks out, flanked by ADVISORS. The weight of the world's on his shoulders. LATESHA (CONT'D) Secretary Callister? He looks back, preoccupied. She catches up, holding her ID: LATESHA (CONT'D) Latesha Simms, DHS, level 2 clearance. I need to ask you a question, sir -- 3/28/07 58. CONTINUED: CALLISTER Not now, you can direct it to my office. LATESHA It'll only take a minute, sir, thirty seconds -- B-36? Can you tell me what it is? 'Cause its not -- CALLISTER -- you don't have clearance, Agent Simms, and I don't have thirty seconds. LATESHA So should I assume it has something to. do with the four CVN class 21 aircraft carriers you and the president just ordered to the Strait of Hormuz -? He looks at her, stunned. How the hell--? LATESHA (CONT'D) I just checked the intel, sir, we have some of the same indexes -- CALLISTER You need to stop assuming. And he moves on. Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling like a mouse in cage filled with lions. Until she ROARS: LATESHA Secretary Callister. Voice echoing down the hail. Callister stops short, stunned by the gall and volume of this woman. She weaves through the GENERALS, planting herself in front of him: LATESHA (CONT'D) My Department's tracking a home-grown terrorist on the loose as we speak who may be connected to a cell with ties inside this building. Now seeing as you just had a meeting back there with more brass than the Navy Marching Band and with the terror threat rising every three hours, I'm going to just have to assume you're in the middle of a very delicate dance to stave off World War Three... so with all due respect, you either give me my thirty seconds and tell me what the hell B-36 is, or this world just fell into an even bigger heap of trouble. Sir. Callister looks down at her, completely struck dumb. She's hit a chord deep inside him. It's called balls. SLAM TO: 3/28/07 59. INT. LOBBY - FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - DAY As Jerry and Rachel enter the POSH LOBBY of the FOUR SEASONS, an obsequious BELLHOP approaches -- he's been waiting for them: BELLHOP Mr. and Mrs. Saxon?

The \"DING\" of an arriving elevator MATCHES US BACK TO: INT. PENTAGON ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS THE LEVEL INDICATOR, having just arrived at floor \"B-35.\" Latesha, wedged between two PENTAGON GUARDS, watches nervously as one of them uses a KEY to open a PANEL revealing: A BIOMETRIC SENSOR. The other guard holds his thumb to the scanner -- yet another PANEL OPENS, with a RED BUTTON marked \"B- 36.\" It hits Latesha: B-36 is a secret level in the Pentagon. The elevator DESCENDS to the final level and OPENS, revealing: 3/28/07 60. INT. HALLWAY - LEVEL B-36 - CONTINUOUS 12-foot concrete walls. High-tech ventilation and surveillance system.

BELLHOP Robes behind the door, jacuzzi with eighteen nozzles that hit in all the right places, if you'll pardon my French. .Need anything, just dial zero, I'm here t2. serve, I'm here to please... And he stands by the door, waiting for a tip. Jerry's still looking aroundwhen Rachel catches his eye. Well? Oh. Jerry digs into his pocket and pulls out TWO NICKELS. JERRY Knock yourself out. The Bellhop is still looking down at his palm when Jerry SHUTS THE DOOR on him. RACHEL This is nice and everything, but what the hell are we doing here? 3/28/07 61. CONTINUED: JERRY Nice? One night in this place is more than one of my paychecks; and that's before taxes -- He heads over to the minibar. Starts rooting through it, pulling out those tiny bottles of alcohol... RACHEL What're you doing? JERRY If we're going down, I'm gonna go down singing. Hey! Chocolate covered almonds, I love these! RACHEL Can you stop eating for a second?

WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) There are items you will need for the next step. KNOCK! KNOCK! A small nod from Rachel and Jerry opens the door. A DELIVERY BOY stands there with a BAG: DELIVERY BOY There y'go, Mr. Saxon. Have a nice day? Jerry takes the bag -- the kid puts out his hand for a tip just as Jerry closes the door on him, dazed. Starts pulling things from the bag: hair. dye, clothes... WOMAN'S VOICE The limousine is waiting for you `downstairs. You have 30 minutes to change your appearance. RACHEL Where are we going now?

Who the.fuck talks like that?! RACHEL -- Jerry -- JERRY We know you're watching! We know you're listening! We know you knowa.'everythina. So why don't you STOP HIDING AND TELL US WHO YOU ARE!! Nothing. Furious, he moves to.the WINDOW -- JERRY (:CONT'D) Fine, have it your way,.Lady -- I'm gonna scream bloody murder out this window 'til every cop in a fifty mile radius comes running and I'm gonna tell them everything even if they think I'm a crazy sonofabitch 'cause at least I won't have to listen to you any more! RACHEL -- JERRY -- He YANKS the window up -- WOMAN'S VOICE STOP. He does. The..FOUR SEASONS GRAPHIC in TV snaps to BLACK -- then DIGITAL STATIC -- a channel RE-ROUTING through some distant computer-controlled network. And now: IMAGES -- FILE FOOTAGE -- a DEFENSE DEPARTMENT LAB, TECHNICIANS assembling computer components, putting together a strange- looking SPHERE -- WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) My name... is Aria. Rachel and Jerry stare -- what the hell is this? 3/26/07 63. INT. PENTAGON - MAINFRAME TANK - CONTINUOUS CLOSE ON LATESHA, also reeling as she stares at something O.S. FLICKERING SHADOWS play across her face-- SCOTT (O.S.) It stands for 'Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Analyst'... And we reveal \"THE TANK.\" A glassed-in wall containing TONS of water. AN AWESOME STEEL SPHERE IN THE WATER, suspended by a claw-like apparatus. The \"brain\" of a com uter network. The very same image Jerry and Rachel just saw on the TV. SCOTT (CONT'D) Twenty-two hundred tons of super-cooled water keeps her from overheating -- that's ninety-two thousand processors, the equivalent of a hundred.millionhuman brains working together as:,.one...\"' LATESHA an electronic espionage system. SCOTT No, that was Echelon, eavesdropping off satellites. This goes.;. much farther. INT. HONEYMOON SUITE CONTINUOUS Jerry and Rachel gape as:MORE IMAGES flash: the RADIO DOMES, SATELLITE DISHES and MAINFRAMES that make up Aria's domain... ARIA I was created by \"DARPA\": the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 2002. My primary directive is to protect the national security of the United States. I have access to track the economies, populations, and military development of every country in the world, as well as intercept all global communications -- from satellites to cell phones to credit card transactions. Jerry and Rachel look at each other -- a computer?! INT. MAINFRAME TANK - LEVEL B-36 - CONTINUOUS SCOTT After 911, our problem wasn't collecting data, it was interpreting it fast enough. Ergo: quantum rocessin 3/28/07 64. CONTINUED: SCOTT (CONT'D) Today there are more microchips than people, and they can all be data-mined, either via direct connectivity or wireless signals --let's say we're chasing someone with a suitcase nuke in L.A., we can order Aria to shut down mass transit, track the perp through traffic cameras... and if given the order, she could even turn a TV into a bomb to take him out. LATESHA (what we're all THINKING) But what if -- SCOTT -- she can't act without authorization. See, she's bound not to countermand our laws -- even the Declaration of Independence is woven into her source code. Her primary role's pre-emptive -- running simulations, identifying threats before they become real... INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - CONTINUOUS JERRY Wait, you think we're a.threat? ARIA (V.0.) No. You're a means to an end. On TV, CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS -- ZOOM to words in CLOSE UP: ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) Under National Security Directive 359, Sub-Section 72 -- \"when units are needed for the national defense, civilians shall be ordered to active Federal service...\" JERRY you're drafting us? RACHEL The guy you killed in the desert -- last time I checked, murder wasn't legal. ARIA In fact, it is. Chapter 802 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice states desertion is punishable by death. So matter-of-fact, its chilling. And what Jerry wants to know, more than anything, is... 3/28/07 65. CONTINUED: JERRY what'd my brother have to do with this? A picture of PAUL SHAW'S DEFENSE I.D. pops on screen: ARIA We were colleagues. Rachel staring at the picture on the screen, then back at Jerry. Can see the blood draining from his face. JERRY No, he worked for the State Department..: ARIA Everyone in deep operations has a cover. Your brother was a Horseman. JERRY What's the hell is a 'Horseman'? INT. MAINFRAME TANK - CONTINUOUS SCOTT You know, clever allegory -- of the apocalypse'--`except we're here to prevent it. Scott taps the console, ID PHOTOS APPEAR of our four \"Horsemen\": PAUL SHAW, SCOTT, and two men we'll call LOWELL and JIMMY. SCOTT (CONT'D) Officially, we don't exist, but we monitor Aria's network 24/7. There were :four of us... til Paul died. He was smarter than all of us put together. LATESHA Working here must be pretty tough -- all the security, the pressure, long hours... As in: \"Did you notice him acting strangely?\" SCOTT Yeah, but you could set your watch by Paul. Except... LATESHA Except what? 3/28/07 66 CONTINUED: SCOTT The night he died? He left his shift three minutes early. Which you don't do. Which he wouldn't do. Latesha's suddenly locked in on a clue -- PRELAP: ARIA (V.0.) Paul and I had a disagreement before he expired... INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - CONTINUOUS Jerry sinks to the edge of the bed, runs hands: through his hair: ARIA To amend it, I need Jerry to perform a task. Simple. JERRY (V.0.) Expired?! You mean died.. That's what we call it, we humans, we call it dying-- RACHEL What's the task? ARIA (V.0.) To insure the national security of the United States. RACHEL What d'you need me for then? ARIA (V.0.) That is not your concern right now. RACHEL Are you kidding me? JERRY Alright, this is bullshit. I'm not doing this --- and you're a computer, you don't know a goddamn thing about my brother. ARIA (V.0.) I know all about him, Jerry. And you. The screen snaps to a SLIDE SHOW of PAUL SHAW'S accomplishments: childhood birthday parties, sports teams, surrounded by friends, beautiful girlfriends, high school graduation, Yale graduation, standing with their dad, William's arm over his shoulder. Jerry almost GASPS at Aria's reaching into his subconscious: ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) Your brother succeeded in everything he did. 3/28/07 67. CONTINUED: ARIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Before he was a year old, he walked. Something that took you eighteen months to accomplish. He was highly gifted, intelligent and principled -- in fact, the only Horseman ever to challenge me. But you, Jerry -- The slide show CHANGES to SECURITY FOOTAGE of Jerry at KINKO'S, slaving away. Playing cards with Kwame, slacking off. His stomach drops. Seeing himself like this. Looking so pathetic. The heart has just been cut out of him. Rachel sees it -- ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) You are similar to Paul in DNA only. Historically you have succeeded in nothing. Initiated nothing. Excelled in nothing. You will perform the task because it is your nature to follow. And because you've seen what happens to deserters. RACHEL -- Jesus, ENOUGH! The screen goes BLACK. ARIA (V.0.:) You have 23 minutes to prepare. There's an adjoining suite with a second bathroom. The DOOR to the adjoining SUITE clicks open. ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) Use it. And she's gone, replaced by the hotel's promotional prattle -- TV VOICE The Four Seasons prides itself on excellent service Jerry stares, overcome. Rachel watches him an emotional beat... RACHEL Jerry? Without answering, he grabs the bag. Walks into the other room without a word. Closes the door. She stares, feeling his shame... then her eyes go to the BRIEFCASE TIMER counting down: \"01:08:43.. 01:08:42... 01:08:41...\" 3/28/07 68. CONTINUED: (2) MAN'S VOICE Halloway-Smith contracted us to transport the briefcase to their corporate office... EXT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - DAY The bank's roped off and labelled \"CRIME AREA.\" Morgan questions the Couriers, studies their transport manifest: MORGAN Biotech? The chemical company? BRINKS COURIER #2 When they make a new compound, they, hold it in a vault for clinical trials. MORGAN Why'd the HAZMAT office issue a special permit for the case? BRINKS COURIER #1 You'd have to ask -- could be` anything from a boner pill to a bioweapon, they never tell us. BRINKS COURIER #2 Tell you one thing, though... the guy never handled a gun before. That LANDS with Morgan. He nods to an agent, dismissing the couriers. Grant approaches: AGENT GRANT We pulled video... nothing. No good angles on Shaw or the girl. MORGAN There.are 14 visible cameras in the lobby! \" 8 hidden no one can see! AGENT GRANT Gotta be a hacker, someone keeping them ahead of us. MORGAN It's a Federal bank; encryption doesn't get more secure.., from now on assume our air's been compromised, too. Tell everyone to go secure on Tac-3, nobody communicates outside this task force without my say-so. 3/28/07 69. CONTINUED: AGENT GRANT I'm on it -- also: they found this upstairs, but the trace signal's dead -- Holds up an evidence bag with Jerry's BONE MIC inside. MORGAN Do not tell me that is what I think it is. Goddamnit, who's leading these people around?! Someone's behind the Wizard of Oz! He turns and spots something: A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in the window of a 7-11. Starts MOVING toward it.-- INT. BATHROOM - FOUR SEASONS - DAY Rachel's face WHIPS UP INTO FRAME, her hair now DYED BLONDE. She stares at her reflection, trying to:process it all. . .when her cell RINGS: \"KYLE.\" With a GASP she picks it up-- RACHEL -- Kyle?! KYLE Hey, mom, it's. me. RACHEL -- sweetie, where areou, are you -- But she's INTERRUPTED as she realizes, oddly, it's a VOICEMAIL -- her heart SINKS: KYLE (V.O.) Got your message, the train's awesome -- Brian tried to burp the alphabet but gagged when he got to \"M.\" I'll call when we hit D.C. Bye, ma -- Rachel holding the phone like it's some kind of life-line to her son. When there's a strange BEEP then the voice of ARIA: ARIA Your son left that message sixty seconds ago. RACHEL I'll do whatever you want -- don't hurt him, please -- I'm begging you. Listen - you're trying to protect something too, right? You'll do whatever it takes. Well that's what it's like to be a mother -- can you understand that? 3/28/07 70. CONTINUED: ARIA There were over 52,000 vocal tone options for my program; I chose this one precisely because it sounds so maternal. People tend to do what you ask when you sound like their mother. RACHEL Jesus... ARIA You'll see your son again soon. Bute there's something I require from you first... EXT. BATHROOM - SAME Jerry approaches the door, hair now BROWN. Beat. He knocks: JERRY Rachel? We gotta go INTERCUT: Rachel in the bathroom, her face betraying the horror of what she's just heard, what Aria's just told her to do -- RACHEL What? No way, I can't just -- ARIA -- when the time comes I'll instruct you to stepaway:fromJerry. Once you hear those words, you'll have thirty seconds. JERRY (V.0.) Rachel? You in there? ARIA Answer Jerry, please. INTERCUT:;Jerry still standing outside the door. Rachel's VOICE,\"mustering strength through the door: RACHEL (V.0.) COMING) Steeling herself, she steps out. Forces a smile while averting her eyes. And pushes past h2-,n like he's lagging... INT. HALLWAY - LEVEL B-36 - DAY Latesha PACES THROUGH FRAME, nervously filing her nails with her MINI SWISS ARMY KNIFE as she talks into a headset. A DESK GUARD watches, annoyed by the filing: 3/28/07 71. CONTINUED: LATESHA I dunno, the whole thing's off somehow - but get this: B-36 isn't a security classification, it's a sub-level here at the Pentagon -- (sees the DESK GUARD eyeing her) What? Girl's gotta groom. INT. 7-11 - BACK ROOM - DAY Morgan's on the other end, Grant and the Clerk run through a playback of the CCTV FEEDS looking out onto the street in front of 7-11. Good old-fashioned VCR. MORGAN -- you're shitting me INT. HALLWAY - B-36 SECTOR - CONTINUOUS LATESHA Yeah, 36 floors underground -- and it gets weirder: ARIA CAM -- WATCHING LATESHA.FROM ABOVE: \"TRACE IN PROGRESS... INTERCEPTING CALL.\" INTERCUTTING WITH MORGAN IN THE 7-11 -- he hears: LATESHA'S VOICE Four years ago, DARPA commissioned... (garbled)... .computer... (garbled)... MORGAN Simms? You're breaking up -- WITH LATESHA -- her cell LCD says: \"Call lost.\" No bars. Muttering \"dainnit,\" she tries to call Morgan back. No dice. ARIA PQV CAM: Latesha snaps her phone shut, notices the camera watching her. Unsettling. We read: \"VOICE MIMEO ACTIVATED\" INT. 7-11 - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS And though Latesha isn't speaking, WE START TO HEAR HER VOICE: LATESHA/ARIA (V.0.) Sorry about that -- As we realize Aria's taken over the call by mimicking Latesha: LATESHA/ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) I'm getting a bad signal down here. 3/28/07 72. CONTINUED: MORGAN I heard 'DARPA' and 'computer' --? LATESHA/ARIA Yes, B-36 was part of a super-computer project, but it was decommissioned. A dead end. The archives are at Fort Meade. Do you want me to head over there? -- but Morgan's only half-listening now as he sees. something on the CCTV feeds: MORGAN Wait -- go back, freeze that - WHAT HE SEES: A STILL of Jerry and Rachel getting in the limo, faces obscured. MORGAN (CONT.':D) Punch up the plate The image enhances, revealing a PLATE NUMBER, its frame bearing the company name: \"ICON LIMOUSINE SERVICES.\" MORGAN (CONT'D) Find that car! Simms, gotta jump, sit tight 'til I call. LATESHA Yes, sir. Morgan, preoccupied, is about to hang up. But stops: did she just call me sir? INT. MAINFRAME TANK - B-36 - DAY Latesha returns to the NETWORK MONITORING HUB to find Scott typing at.the console. A MACHINE ARM drops down from above, spider-like.: The device animates as a CRANIAL SCANNER opens: SCOTT Aria's system uses biometric security to identify us, so only Horsemen can access her core programming. Suddenly his head's ensconced in a LASER GRID that scans every inch of his features: \"PROCESSING FOR MATCH... HORSEMAN IDENT CONFIRMED: BOWMAN, SCOTT.\" Latesha watches somewhat dumbstruck as the machine arm retreats upward. SCOTT (CONT'D) Aria, go voice active, please. 3/26/07 73 CONTINUED: ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) Hello, Scott. How may I assist you? LATESHA It talks? ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) I'm fluent in 6,800 languages, 41,000 dialects, and 750 extinct tongues. SCOTT Aria, this is Latesha Simms, she's here as part of a counter-terrorism task force. ARIA OVER SPEAKER.(V.0. A pleasure to serve you, Ms. Simms. LATESHA (thrown, to Scott). Am I supposed to -- (he gestures, \"answer Um... what's up. SCOTT. Aria, I'd like to:bring,up all the log feeds the night Paul died -- when he left the building. ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) Of course. Scott types on the console and after a BEAT grainy black-and- white SURVEILLANCE FEED springs up onto the big MONITOR. Several different angles Of PAUL SHAW exiting the mainframe tank, moving down corridors, getting in the elevator. Weird to see this TINTYPE of Jerry. Same eyes, same hair, same walk. Flicks a quick look up at the camera -- LATESHA There's no feed from inside here? SCOTT No need for cameras in here, we've got Aria. Latesha looks through a glass divider at Aria floating in the tank. Creeped out. The FOOTAGE JUMPING as Paul rounds the corner for the elevator. Presses his THUMB to the panel. SCOTT (V.0.) (CONT'D) So weird... no overt body language, he's even casual. Leaving like it's any other day. 3/28/07 74. CONTINUED: (2) LATESHA Except three minutes early... ON THE MONITOR: the elevator doors open and Paul steps inside. Latesha studies the feed. Something's not right. Then... her eyes NARROW: the way Paul's facing the button panel. Like he's deliberately pivoting away from the camera. LATESHA (CONT'D) Wait, in the reflection, did you see that? Scott rewinds the FOOTAGE, ZOOMS IN. Paul stepping into the elevator and facing the button panel. CLOSE ON HIS FACE in the panel's REFLECTIVE SURFACE -- SCOTT Is he... blinking? Yes. Erratically, deliberately. Fucking weird. Scott and Latesha share a look. Suddenly, the image on the monitor starts to FLICKER and JUMP -- ARIA. OVER SPEAKER (V.O.) I'm experiencing interference in network 7752B, please allow me to shut down and analyze. SCOTT Negative, I'm prioritizing this. ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) I'll note my protest in the data log. This is getting weirder by the second -- PAUL'S DISTORTED REFLECTION in the panel, his eyes definitely blinking weirdly: LATESHA It's like he's trying to say something... SCOTT A code. He's blinking code LATESHA It's not Morse, but there's a sequence to it -- SCOTT Oh, that sonofabitch... He grabs a piece of paper and starts WRITING MADLY, scribbling numbers, scratching some out, then converting them to LETTERS -- F... I. 3/28/07 75 CONTINUED: (3) SCOTT (CONT'D) It's a code -- Hexadecimal -- a number system that can be converted to letters the first computer used it as a programming language back in the 50's. Latesha watches, rapt: R... E. E... X... T. .\" ON THE FEED: the elevator door OPENS and Paul steps out. That's all they get. They stare, trying to make sense of the letters: \"F.. I. R... E... E.. X... T.. .\" SCOTT (CONT'D The hell is that? Staring, minds spinning -- and suddenly.she puts.a FINGER between the two \"E's.\" Dividing words.. And GETS IT: EXT. CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER MOVING FAST together down the same corridor Paul went down. They turn a corner... and STOP DEAD:- A FIRE EXTINGUISHER is mounted on the wall. Latesha sees the placement of the CAMERAS caddy-corner to the intersecting hallways... and knows what Paul was doing: LATESHA It's the only spot in the hallway not covered by .the cameras. (LOW):: He was hiding something from her. A SHIFT to ARIA CAM confirms it: she can't see exactly what they're doin Latesha moves urgently to the extinguisher, starts examining it for something, anything... but finds NOTHING. LATESHA (CONT'D) I don't get it. He had to be saying 'Fire Extinguisher.' Scott pulls a MAINTENANCE SHEET off the wall. Scans -- SCOTT Maintenance replaced it yesterday. This isn't right... they weren't supposed to do it til June. They lock eyes. 3/28/07 76. CONTINUED: LATESHA She read the code too... where's 'Recyling'? EXT. LIMO - DAY The limo glides through traffic. In back, Rachel's nodded off. Jerry watches her from across the limo, sketching something on a cocktail napkin... RACHEL'S FACE. It's a perfect, beautiful rendering. And we sense something in his look too-- something's changed. As Rachel wakes with a start -- RACHEL Hey -- sorry, I didn't mean to -- am I drooling? I bet I'm drooling. You didn't sleep? JERRY Night shifts. I'm used to. Rachel sits up, sees the napkin. Grins, surprised. RACHEL Wow, is that me? JERRY One of my only party tricks. RACHEL It's really good. Jerry looks down at it, not used to having his work appreciated. Rachel, can see how deeply affected he was by what Aria said. It seems to make her feel uuiilty somehow... kinder... RACHEL (CONT'D) About what Aria said... I'm sorry. They're;starting to connect. He glances out the window... JERRY You have to understand, I wasn't his twin, I was more like his... little brother. Always trying to catch up. And you wouldn't believe how... nice he was to me. Teaching me things when we were kids, telling me how great I was. He was the only one who ever did. Of course he was involved in some super secret National Security project. He was a superstar. He had a rocket strapped to his back. I'm the fuck-up. 3/28/07 77. CONTINUED: JERRY (CONT'D) I wear it like a medal, like it actually means something... but the funny thing is? This is probably the most important thing I'll ever do. This. Right now. This completely insane journey or whatever it is. I'm actually needed in something, me. Jerry Shaw is required. But what am I thinking? I'll probably fuck this up, too -- RACHEL You're being too hard on yourself-- JERRY No. I'm not being hard enough. That's been the problem. They look at each other. A real moment for Jerry. A seismic shift in his life perspective. But then something catches his eye -- his look DARKENS. Out the window, a highway sign: \"DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.\" The driver's.tinted divider window lowers, he offers a folder. CHAUFFEUR Your passports and itinerary. Now Rachel's seen the airport. sign, too. Looks at Jerry... JERRY Uh... could you give us a minute? The Chauffeur nods, the window RISES again. Heart pounding, Jerry grabs the briefcase and slides back the timer sheath to check the countdown: \"00:15:36...00:15:35...\" RACHEL You don't think -- JERRY -- we know what she can do, she doesn't need us to crash a plane -- RACHEL -- what if it's not about just one plane? They look at each other. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What to do. When Rachel grabs the briefcase as the limo pulls curbside. RACHEL (CONT'D) I have more to lose in this. If anything happens to Kyle then my life's over anyway -- But Jerry grabs her hand, taking the case. 3/28/07 78. CONTINUED: (2) JERRY Rachel -- til we met, I had nothing to lose. We do this together. A LONG LOOK BETWEEN THEM. As they realize, this could be it. INT. DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS We FEEL the heightened state of alert. NATIONAL GUARDSMEN with M-16's scan the crowd. Jerry and Rachel enter, adrenaline pumping -- he opens the envelope to reveal two PASSPORTS with their photos, but the names \"MARK and ALLISON ACKERMAN.\" JUST THEN Aria's VOICE comes over the P.A.: ARIA OVER P.A. Allison Ackerman, please pick up the white courtesy phone -- They stop, hearing her. Rachel TENSES in this moment moves to the RINGING courtesy phone, answers: ARIA (V.0.) Go to the ticketing machine, you'll receive two tickets to Paris. RACHEL -- Paris? ARIA (V.0.) Once you have the tickets, walk to gate 17-C. Move quickly. EXT.

Jerry looks down at the case that could kill them all... 3/28/07 79. CONTINUED: SECURITY ATTENDANT Sir, you'll have to put that through. Jerry nervously sets it on the conveyor belt, they pull off their shoes... watch the case move toward the mouth of the machine, then pass through the metal detector, catching a GLIMPSE of the X-RAY SCREEN... the briefcase glides into view... A STRANGE GLITCH as the screen fritzes, then normalizes revealing the contents: A HAIR DRYER AND DIRTY CLOTHES?! They notice the surveillance cam watching: RACHEL she changed the screen... The case comes off the conveyor, the TSA agent hands it back: TSA AGENT Can't be too careful. JERRY You're doing a great job. As they walk on, he checks the timer, 00:03:22... 00:03:21.. 11 They pass a KIDS' BAND and their teacher, gathered around an airline CUSTOMER SERVICE DESK.

Agent Grant and airport cops round the corner ahead -- our heroes veer past a FLASHING MESSAGE BOARD that changes: GET ON THE SLIDEWALK. They leap onto the SLIDEWALK which starts ACCELERATING as they run -- travellers gawk as Jerry and Rachel race by -- they reach the end but are going so fast.that they're JETTISONED off the conveyor, TUMBLING into passengers. Agents run onto the slidewalk but it SUDDENLY BRAKES, JERKING them off their feet -- they're LAUNCHED into the air, a domino- effect of crashing people.` Jerry and Rachel pull themselves up and run toward gate 17-C, another screen CHANGES: TAKE THE EMERGENCY EXIT. Above a door, the \"EXIT\" sign FLASHES UNNATURALLY -- the door automatically UNLOCKS -- they push through -- Morgan runs up, too late; the door's shut again. Sees an AIRPORT JANITOR -- MORGAN (CONT'D) Open this NOW! The janitor quickly swipes his ID through the keycard scanner, but it BUZZES RED. Aria's locking them out.

CRATE - CONTINUOUS Close together, they suck in sharply, freezing as FOOTFALLS run past... then, QUIET. The walkie/phone BLIPS: ARIA OVER WALKIE (V.0.)

Hundreds of them, stem valves removed, ready to be.dumped. Scott and Latesha break into a RUN, skittering down stairs to the main floor. Running towards the forklift, waving wildly: LATESHA SCOTT Stop!! STOP! STOP!! But the forklift Operator can't hear them with the bright orange EARPLUGS in his ears. Speeds the forklift to the mouth of the compactor and dumps the extinguishers inside just as Scott and Latesha catch up and see the HUGE CRUSHING ARM of the compactor rumbling down to flatten everything'- The compactor Operator looks over as Scott and Latesha wave their IDS furiously and he punches a button to STOP the arm just three feet shy of crushing everything. LATESHA We have to look in there! Latesha starts climbing INTO the compactor COMPACTOR OPERATOR Lady, you can't do that! LATESHA The hell I can't! Come on! Shit. Scott has no choice but to follow her and climbs in, ducking low, the ARM frozen just feet above them. The compactor's foul, inches of industrial grease and crap and God- knows-what.

Grabs Latesha by the jacket and tumbles out of the COMPACTOR but not before Latesha sees something on an extinguisher and reaches back-- SCOTT Latesha! -- grabbing the extinguisher as CRASH!! The ARM CRUSHES down as she snaps her hand back just in time. Turns the tank over and palms something, unnoticed by everyone. As the operator runs up to her, beside himself -- OPERATOR I don't know what happened! It wouldn't stop! Latesha catches her breath, livid,a chill ripping through her. SCOTT -- you okay? Jesus (but her eyes are LOCKED on the Cameras) Latesha? LATESHA yeah. I need to get out of here. SCOTT Yes. Yes. Good idea. Come on -- As they start walking out. Workers parting to let them through.

Their MOTHERS, veiled in black, gather and talk. Bearded, turbaned MEN carrying AK-47's argue politics. A domestic, even tranquil scene of life in another part of the world... EXT. DESERT ROAD - CONTINUOUS A CARAVAN of VEHICLES RACE DOWN A HIGHWAY:. SUV's mounted with surface-to-air RPG's form a protective cordon around a BLACK MERCEDES. As the cars ROAR INTO LENS, we go.to: EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN POV THOUGH A LONG-RANGE SCOPE: the caravan as seen by a TWO-MAN SPECIAL OPS TEAM perched on a ridge. As the LEADER surveils the cars, his partner finishes assembling a two-foot UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), rigging it with EXPLOSIVES: SPECIAL FORCES LEADER We have visual onthetarget. Confirm 'go' for UAV launch. INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT SUPER: \"JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER, THE PENTAGON\" Sat-feeds monitor the caravan. Military brass observes: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GEOFF CALLISTER (50's, African American; eyes with soul and a wary intelligence). Beside him: COLONEL THOMPSON (Full-Bird, decorated). COLONEL THOMPSON Alpha One, you're confirmed 'go': active UAV at GPS papa, zulu, three, zero. EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN The Ops Team activates a remote transmitter, LAUNCHING the UAV into the sky like a small ROCKET -- amazingly, its silent. INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - CONTINUOUS An airborne feed from the UAV shows it descending on the caravan. A PENTAGON TECHIE manipulates a JOY STICK, controlling the drone from 6500 miles away: PENTAGON TECHIE #1 We have system control. 3/28/07 2 CONTINUED: COLONEL THOMPSON Activate laser mic. EXT. SKIES OVER DESERT - CONTINUOUS DRONE POV: tracking the caravan, singling out the MERCEDES. The drone emits a THIN LASER BEAM that hits its rear windshield -- INT. THE PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY Over speakers, VOICES speak \"Balochi.\" A TRANSLATOR listens: CALLISTER Is it him? TRANSLATOR Four males, one of them's speaking with a.. I think it's a Rakhshaniadialect, consistent with our intel on Al=Khoei. COLONEL THOMPSON Gimme voiceprint analysis. The screen pops to an AUDIO WAVEFORM of the conversation. VOICEPRINT ANALYSIS finishes, the; screen shows a FILE PHOTO of a BEARDED MAN: \"37% PROBABLE MATCH = ID AL-KHOEI.\" CALLISTER I'm not taking 37% to-the President... John, weigh in here? He looks to a plasma: the PRESIDENT'S CABINET is assembled via teleconference from the White House Situation Room: DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CIA and NCTC concur this is the target based on reliable Intel from the Brits. WHIP TO another monitor: the caravan starts to VEER off-road. TECHIE Sire they're pulling off the highway. TECHIE #2 We have abort recommendation. The ANALYSIS ARRAY reads: \"RECOINDATION: ABORT MISSION.\" The source of this recommendation, for now, remains a mystery. COLONEL THOMPSON If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding once in a lifetime, we can't let him go. CALLISTER Alright, stay with him... 3/28/07 3 CONTINUED: THE SATELLITE VIEW shows the caravan approaching the commune. EXT. DESERT COMMUNE - DAY Mothers grab up their children and pull them aside as the vehicles arrive. ARMED MEN emerge... INTERCUTTING - THE PENTAGON OPS ROOM: the computer pinpoints DOTS on the satellite feed that represent WEAPONRY on-site -- TECHIE We've got AK-47's, RPC's, Chaparral guided missiles -- COLONEL THOMPSON Looks like a training camp. THE DESERT: Bodyguards cluster around a TURBANED:MAN as he emerges from the Mercedes. It looks a lot like the man from the file photo, but the beard makes it hard to confirm. MID-AIR WITH THE UAV: It SWOOPS, targeting the man -- SNAP: THE PENTAGON: a BLURRY SNAPSHOT of his FACE appears. A DIGITAL WIRE-FRAME is overlaid on the man's face: \"5I$ PROBABLE MATCH - INSUFFICIENT DATA. RECOMMENDATION: ABORT MISSION.\" TECHIE 51%. 'Abort' rec holds. THE DESERT: Now our guy DISAPPEARS into the crowd as they begin MOVING toward a large WOODEN PLANK on the desert floor. Some of the men take hold of the plank, drag it back to reveal... a PIT. THE PENTAGON: SAME IMAGE in real-time on the feeds: CALLISTER What is that, a weapons cache? ANALYST Sir, the placement of stones around the pit, markers for the Five Pillars of Islam... I think it's a funeral. Everyone trades looks -- this just got even more complicated. THE DESERT: from the back of a TENTED TRUCK, a BODY is lifted, shrouded in white. The men carry it through blowing sand... the procession stopping at the pit. They begin lowering the body... THE PENTAGON: on monitors, a section of the GENEVA CONVENTION SCROLLS: TECHIE Sir, striking a funeral would put us in violation of the Geneva convention. 3/28/07 4. CONTINUED: COLONEL THOMPSON Once this guy's gone, he's gone. The PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL pipes in -- PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL \"Hors de Combat\" -- legally we'd be open to international prosecution. But we have no independent intel verifying it's in fact a funeral, and the presence of weapons certainly leaves room for interpretation. TECHIE #2 I have POTUS calling from Air Force One. CALLISTER (a beat, looks around). Everyone agree this is the best course of action? No one dissents. Callister picks up: CALLISTER (CONT'D) Mr. President, we have.a.51% identity match on Majid Al-Khoei. There is some possibility he's at a funeral, but we don't know. Regardless, counsel thinks we can claim 'Overriding Legal Authority.' Also, you should be aware we have an abort recommendation, but your cabinet, the Speaker, the Joint Chiefs urge a 'go.' THE PRESIDENT (V.0.) You left yourself out of the lineup. Callister pauses. AS THE MESSAGE ON THE MONITOR STARTS BLINKING: \"ABORT, ABORT, ABORT...\" CALLISTER Yessir... we gauge our strategy by two standards: the highest probability of success with the least amount of collateral damage. At 51% probability, we don't have either one. GENERAL THOMPSON And if it is Al-Khoei and he walks, Sir, we're putting our people at risk. There's a long silence as the President considers. 3/28/07 5. CONTINUED: ( 2) THE PRESIDENT (V.0.) I respect your caution, Geoff, but we won't get another chance like this... you have a green light. Callister's obviously opposed, but he bites his tongue: CALLISTER Understood. We're weapons free. And with deadly calm, Techies execute orders into-headsets: TECHIE TECHIE 2 -- Switching to Tac-2, -- MTS active, painting the acquisition's good -- target -- EXT. DESERT - FUNERAL - DAWN The women begin to SING the \"Nasheen,\" a.funeral song praising Allah. The beautiful VOICES grow until all other sound is GONE. DRONE POV: the feed from the CAMERA INSIDE THE NOSE-CONE as it LAUNCHES its missile -- it ZOOMS toward the funeral gathering -- The haunting, beautiful voices WAIL... in the moment before impact, we see: birds flying across the great plain... a herd of running gazelles... the DESERT WIND blankets a layer of sand over the shrouded body in the pit... a CHILD'S HAND grasping his mother's... A WHITE FLASH AS THE MISSILE HITS: HOLD IN WHITE: CREDIT SE UENCE: WORDS CLOSE UP... a digitized electronic scan, as if they're being analyzed by someone: \"We the people of the United States... more perfect union...\" Highlights of The Constitution, The. Declaration of Independence... We land on: \"...whenever any form of government becomes destructive...it is the right of the people to alter it or to abolish it...\" CLOSE IN on these last words: \"ABOLISH IT.\" WHITEWASH: INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT We're looking at a DIGITAL TIMER ticking down crucial seconds -- then a MAN's FACE, intense, focused on something below screen: this is JERRY SHAW, 30, handsome, roguish. Somewhere between an adult and a child -- under his breath: JERRY damnit... 3/28/07 6. CONTINUED: VOICE (O.S.) You gotta make a choice. You gotta move-- JERRY -- I know. VOICE (O.S.) Now. Who are you gonna be? So Jerry makes his move, which we see is SLAMMING down a PLAYING CARD representing a group of DWARVES. He sits across from KWAME, 17. They're playing a geeky role-playing CARD and DICE game, CASH on the table. JERRY KWAME there. Dwarves?: Bullshit -- Bullshit? I just blocked your ass and attacked with (checks card) Ancient Mastery points. --.dwarves don't have that -- -- read the oracle text, my friend. -- shit A thick-mascara/black lipstick BECKY enters, removing her SMOCK: BECKY You know what would be great? If you guys took a longer break. That'd be awesome. JERRY Hey, Becky? When're you going to start wearing makeup? Kwame laughs as Becky tosses her smock at Jerry: BECKY .The collator's broken. JERRY Dude: no its not. BECKY Oh yeah it is, dude! She heads out as Jerry collects the cash. Kwame puts on his own smock as Jerry offers him a quick lesson: JERRY Your first mistake? Underestimating dwarves. Power can come from anywhere -- tomorrow night I'll give you first roll and a bonus pack if y-- 3/28/07 7. CONTINUED: ( 2) KWAME I'm not gonna be here tomorrow, remember? I'm going to Cornell. And Jerry stops. A hit to the solar plexus. Wherever we are, this kid's off to a bright future. But not Jerry. JERRY That -- wow. Good for you. So it's your last night. You're gonna spend it collating. KWAME -- what? But she said the collator's broken. JERRY And that's why we have those rubber thimbles in the drawer --.congratulations on Cornell, though, that's huge! TRACK WITH HIM out to... A COUNTER AREA as, he pins on his NAMETAG: \"JERRY.\" Rows of COPY MACHINES and COMPUTER CUBICLES. He takes his place behind a register. Smiles, getting it up: JERRY (CONT'D) Welcome to Kinko's, how can I help you? The CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK sound of the machines gets louder and louder as they BECOME THE SOUND OF: INT. \"EL\" SUBWAY CAR - MORNING The KRAK-KRAK-KRACKING SUBWAY. We glimpse people looking at their BLACKBERRYS. Talking on CELL PHONES. Listening to IPODS and playing GAME BOYS. The NEWS plays on an LCD mounted on the train wall. A society lost in an \"electronic elsewhere.\" And JERRY, with a SKETCH PAD in his lap. A surprisingly good pencil rendering of the face of a LARGE DOG -- weird, but he's got talent. The TV disturbs his concentration -- news footage of BOMBED-OUT EMBASSIES, emergency vehicles, wounded victims: SHEPARD SMITH a heightened terror alert due to a series of suicide bombings, believed to be in retaliation for a deadly attack outside Abadan that killed forty people. Though the White House has denied involvement, Shia leaders have denounced the U.S. as responsible... AL-JAZEERA FOOTAGE: A SHIA SPOKESMAN is translated into ENGLISH: 3/28/07 8. CONTINUED: SPOKESMAN Your embassies were only the beginning! Our warriors are already within your borders. Until American leadership is removed from power, Allah's revenge is upon you! And during all this, Jerry notices something: people are glancing at each other aranoid. What a fucking world... EXT. ATM MACHINE - MORNING An ATM CARD gets slid into the slot. Jerry looks up. THE ATM CAMERA IS STARING RIGHT AT HIM. Then, a BEEP gets his attention: \"INSUFFICIENT FUNDS.\" He processes this a moment... his exhale doesn't just say, \"FUCK,\" it says \"FUCK 1 KNEW IT.\" INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY .-MORNING Saying it's a modest place would be kind. Jerry opens his mailbox. Just BILLS, some of which will:go unpaid this month. A BEAT as he shoves them back in and we HARD CUT TO: INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MORNING A DOOR OPENS: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI, Jerry's elderly Polish landlady. Pleased to see him, but painfully annoyed to know what's coming: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Jerry. JERRY Whatever are you cooking right now? Is the greatest thing I've ever smelled in my life, I swear to God -- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI is schab wieprzowy po polsku -- you have the rent, yes? JERRY -- here's some of it -- most of it -- but I've got something else for you... something special... Eyebrows bobbing. Mrs. Wierzbowsky knows exactly what it is. Sighs. Knows she can't resist him -- INT. KITCHEN - MRS. WIERZBOWSKI'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER CLOSE ON Jerry pushing a THUMB TAC into the dog sketch we saw him doing on the subway. PULL BACK to reveal about 25 other sketches on the wall. All of the same dog. The actual DOG, Johann, lies underneath the kitchen table. 9. 3/28/07 CONTINUED: JERRY So I think. No, I'm pretty sure that's the best one so far --- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Yes. Is good -- rent is better. She puts a bowl of STEW into Jerry's hands. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D) You are hungry, I am guessing. JERRY Oh, no, no. I couldn't -- Unless, you know, you insist. He sits at the table, starts eating. This is their routine. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI So where is girl? I don't see her? JERRY Oh, the redhead? No. She... that's over. She got smart. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Like the others. JERRY Well, womenareIpretty smart. I've discovered. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI You are like Johann. Jerry stops eating, mouth full. As Johann looks up. JERRY Your -- I'm like your dog? MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Look at him. Is big dog. Labrador. But he believe... he is terrier. So is Labrador... but no labrador. Somehow Jerry can't get his eyes off Johann. Quietly: JERRY why do you think that is? As she pours a drink into a plastic cup -- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Perhaps many things. When I rescue Johann from pound, they say he was abuse. (MC)RF ) 3/28/07 10. CONTINUED: (2) MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D) As puppy. They kick him when baby, make him feel not big. You need someone for rescuing you. Jerry looks at her, sad-smiles. Takes a sip and holy shit: JERRY This is -- vodka -- Jesus, its eight- thirty in the morning -- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI -- you cannot eat bigos without vodka. Adjusting to it, Jerry drinks again -- as his CELL PHONE RINGS. He looks at his phone, freezing. Mrs. Wierzbowski notices. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D) Is the girl? Answer. Tell her you'. are Labrador. Then ask if she give you money for rent. But we've PUSHED IN on Jerry, who stares at the name on the phone. Something's affecting him deeply. He says, quietly: JERRY its my mother. MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Is problem? JERRY is problem. INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER Jerry steps outside as the phone keeps RINGING, debating: WHAT TO DO. Finally, he answers, as if ready for punishment: JERRY Hey, mom... Jerry stands there in silhouette. LISTENING. Something is happening... .suddenly he loses his balance -- sinks to the floor, phone to his ear -- staring in pain -- EXT. CHURCH - DAY MOURNERS are gathering in their somber best, shaking hands. Across the street, we find Jerry, getting out of a taxi. Standing in a rumpled suit. Grim; the last thing he wants to do is enter that church. It's almost as if he can't. Finally, from somewhere, strength. He walks forward. 3/28/07 11. INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS Jerry heads down the aisle, painfully self-conscious. Most of the MOURNERS are in the pews, turning to look at him as he passes. When suddenly there's a SCREAM OF TERROR -- and Jerry BRACES as if he was expecting it -- looks over at a WOMAN pointing like he was a fucking bodysnatcher and she collapses -- Jerry holds up his hands as everyone turns to look at him-- JERRY -- no! I-- I'm not him! All eyes on him. His voice, sad, heartbroken: JERRY (CONT'D) It's okay! I'm not Paul! Locks eyes with his MOTHER and FATHER up in the front pew. Their eyes red from crying, withered shells. And Jerry gives a lame wave before heading reluctantly up to the COFFIN. Devastated, he leans in -- and we MOVE AROUND to see the body: And it's fucking HIM -- Jerry's very own face, but one that seems to have been RECONSTRUCTED after some kind of accident. Gruesome and handsome all at once. This was PAUL SHAW. Jerry's identical twin. Off the surreal moment... A reverbed TRUMPET PLAYS, the tune familiar. In fact, it's: INT. APARTMENT - DAY THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, booming from a trumpet played by an 8 year- old boy: KYLE HOLLOMAN. A WOMAN blurs into frame: RACHEL HOLLOMAN, searching for car keys. 28, smart, beautiful, but fiercely independent, she's a single mom who's taken life's knocks. Never as cool-headed as she wants to be, she's on a short fuse with everyone but Kyle, whom she adores: RACHEL Okayokay... okay: we came home, put down the leftovers, you turned on the TV, I went over, I said no TV-- She turns to the TV area and walks straight INTO a table. Stuns her, momentarily, but she doesn't break stride -- KYLE -- we're gonna be late, huh? RACHEL -- absolutely not -- I turned it off, came over here, checked messages, put the leftovers in the-- 3/28/07 12. CONTINUED: KYLE RACHEL --knocked over the phone-- --right, knocked over the phone, put it back, put the food in the fridge-- She opens the fridge: HER KEYS sit atop a Tupperware container. Kyle hits a high note and we SLAM TO: INT. RACHEL'S CAR - MORNING The KEY turning in the ignition of a crappy, old Honda. The engine CHOKES, SPUTTERS. Rachel's tense-- RACHEL we need to get a new car -- KYLE I like your car. We're gonna be late. The engine still SPLIT-SPUT-SPUTTERING.::.. a BUS. whizzes by, slows up ahead at a bus stop. Rachel gives up, jumps out: RACHEL No we're not: the bus. KYLE -- are you kidding? EXT. CITY STREET - DAY Rachel and Kyle HAUL ASS toward the bus stop, both struggling with Kyle's carry-on, a.garment bag, her purse, and a trumpet case marked with STICKERS (Green Bay Packers among them)-- RACHEL I put vitamins in your toiletry bag, don't forget to take two in the morning -- KYLE and one at night, I know -- RACHEL And your inhaler, which I may need to use now, is in the outside pocket -- wait! They rush back to a MAILBOX, she pulls bills from her purse: KYLE More bills? RACHEL Yup -- that's what happens when you have a kid on lay-away. They smile at each other. When SUDDENLY a BUS ROARS PAST the WIND GUSTS and the bills go FLYING into traffic: 3/28/07 13 CONTINUED: RACHEL (CONT'D) OH, SHIT! STAY HERE! Rachel waves her arms at oncoming cars, runs INTO TRAFFIC-- KYLE YOU SWORE!! As she chases the bills, SCREECHING and HONKING around her: RACHEL I KNOW, I'M SORRY! (Porsche HONKS as it PASSES) HEY, A LITTLE COMMON COURTESY, ASSHOLE! And she runs back to Kyle, THROWS the bills in the mailbox -- KYLE You swore again. Was that our bus? Rachel looks: PAN to across the street, the bus is now LEAVING THE BUS STOP. PAN back to Rachel: SHIT!! RACHEL: Okay, now were gonna.be late. She puts fingers in her mouth and WHISTLES HARD for a cab -- INT. TRAIN STATION - WISCONSIN - DAY A CLASS OF MUSIC STUDENTS boards and Amtrak train. Rachel and Kyle are RUNNING through the crowd toward them -- RACHEL Scuze us, coming through, sorry -- WAIT!! WAIT!! Finally they arrive. Kyle's teacher, MRS. MILLER, smiles: MRS. MILLER Under the wire -- RACHEL Hi -- sorry -- Rachel Holloman, we met-- MRS. MILLER -- of course, Barbara Miller. You should probably -- And Rachel's stomach drops. Knows they've been racing towards this moment all morning but still not willing to accept it. Turning Kyle to face her -- 3/28/07 14. CONTINUED: RACHEL Okay. Now. I want you to have an awesome time -- KYLE I will, mom -- RACHEL -- you can eat junk food, just remember to brush your teeth; and if you're gonna goof off, just be really smart about it; and try not to stay up past your bedtime, you get really cranky when you do that'-- He gets very contrarian if he doesn't get at least eight -- MRS. MILLER I'm afraid it's time to board, Mrs. Holloman. Tears springing to Rachel's eyes. She tries to hide them. Bending down to be eye to eye with her son. Sotto -- RACHEL You see all these kids? They're all calling their mothers. You just do it more -- KYLE It's only two days,: mom. Y'know... you could try and some have fun too, wouldn't kill ya.. RACHEL Fun? What's that? I love you so much, baby.You're my everything. Rock the house. KYLE -- love you too -- They separate -- she watches as Kyle boards with Mrs. Miller: RACHEL Call me! MRS. MILLER Your mom gonna be okay? KYLE It's unclear. As they head into the train, Rachel steels herself and GOES. Passing the BAGGAGE AREA... 3/28/07 15. CONTINUED: (2) We HOLD as the PORTER places Kyle's TRUMPET CASE on a conveyor belt. Oddly, it's ELECTRONICALLY REDIRECTED AWAY FROM THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS -- down a separate belt, where it emerges in a pick- up turnstile. Its lifted off the track by... A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN. Nervous. Really nervous. And the strangest thing -- he touches his ear and MURMURS something in Tajiki. To no one. Like a crazy person. What the hell? Walks to the curb where his white van idles. On the side is a decal: \"HASSAD DRY CLEANERS.\" Loads the trumpet inside as we: INT. SHAW HOME - AFTERNOON Solemn quiet. Mourners talking in hushed tones. A buffet. Old people. Children. And over these shots, WHISPERED VOICES: WOMAN #1 (V.O.) you didn't know either? WOMAN #2 (V.0.) No idea. WOMAN #3 (V.0.) I knew he had a brother. But not a twin, that was... WOMAN.#1 (V.0.) I know, I know... Four WOMEN sit together. Heartbroken, unsettled. One glances across into a sitting room, where Jerry sits alone on a sofa. We're CLOSE on Jerry now. Holding a glass, etched with hearts. Looking at it as if it means something. Somehow, his childhood. He looks up at the stairs, as if knowing he needs to go up there. So he does. We MOVE with him: WOMAN #1 (CCNT'D) when was the last time they saw him? WOMAN #2 Margaret said years... INT. SHAW HOUSE - PAUL AND JERRY'S ROOM - DAY TROPHIES. RIBBONS. All of them awarded to PAUL SHAW. TIGHT on Jerry's face as he scans the shelves of evidence. Evidence that he had a brother. A superior brother. Again and again we see: PAUL SHAW. PAUL SHAW. PAUL. PAUL. Then Jerry finds one framed CERTIFICATE. In the back. A Junior High ART PRIZE. Awarded to JERRY SHAW. He smiles at the fucking absurdity of it as a figure appears behind him... 3/28/07 16. CONTINUED: It's WILLIAM. Their father. The worst day of this man's life. Jerry composes himself quickly. They stare for a moment. WILLIAM Six months without a boo or a bah. JERRY Didn't realize it'd been that long. WILLIAM Your mom was worried. So where were you this time? JERRY Nowhere. Singapore. Alaska for a few weeks. got a job for a while. On a...fishing boat. Met some great p- WILLIAM -- that's nice. Looks like you're really seeing the world. JERRY I'm trying, you know, just to -- But William has just started crying.. Sobs of absolute loss. Jerry stands there, frozen, until William EMBRACES HIM. Jerry hugs him back -- tightly, grateful and starting to feel again. And just then, William says, quietly, through tears: WILLIAM You sound just like him. Jerry's eyes find a point in space. This is love by proxy. And now he hugs, his father in support, not unity. William pulls back. Takes his wallet from his pocket: WILLIAM (CONT'D) I want to give you some, uh... JERRY No. -- Dad, I'm okay. I'm doing really well. I promise. His father holds out some bills. North of two-hundred dollars. It's a stand-off. The question is: does Jerry have enough pride to reject the offer? And the answer is... EXT. CHICAGO STREET - ATM MACHINE - DAY CLOSE ON THE PIN NUMBER AGAIN, getting PUNCHED IN. Then FIND JERRY, exhausted from the funeral, slipping the money his father gave him into a deposit envelope. A glance at the SECURITY CAMERA. Then a BEEP makes him look at the screen. 3/28/07 17 CONTINUED: AND WE PUNCH IN TIGHTER ON JERRY, WHO STARES, STUNNED. The screen reads: \"BALANCE: $750,000.00\" What the HELL? Glances back to the people behind him, they want him to hurry. He hits \"Cancel.\" But the machine, as if disobeying, spits out five $100 bills-- JERRY -- whoa -- Jerry stabs cancel again. Now TEN MORE $100 bills-come out. He glances at the people in line, nervous-- JERRY (CONT'D) -- two seconds, sorry -- Eyes flick back to the ATM CAMERA. He covers it with his hand, pushes \"cancel\" again and again. But now.. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN $100 BILLS HAS COME OUT, getting JAMMED' in the slot. People start to PEER OVER as Jerry SCRAMBLES to keep the cash from flying everywhere. And finally. The machine stops. He stuffs all the money in his pocket. Everyone's staring. JERRY (CONT'D) Big date. So... fingers crossed. INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING.- HALLWAY - NIGHT Jerry enters, a little dazed -- heads for his apartment as Mrs. Wierzbowski steps from. hers, Johann hiding behind her: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Jerry! All day they make delivery! Jerry moves fast to her, a little out of breath -- shoves a thousand dollars into her hand: JERRY Here's the rest of the rent -- next month's, too -- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI -- where do you get this? JERRY Just take it -- it's okay, I owe you -- MRS. WIERZBOWSKI I had to open your apartment, too many packages come, they come for hours -- JERRY For me? 3/28/07 18. INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Jerry whips open his apartment door -- as far as he can: it's blocked by something. He reaches in, flips on the LIGHT: BOXES EVERYWHERE. Reeling, he picks one up, rips it open. Packing peanuts fly: a pair of night-vision binoculars. WHAT IS HAPPENING? Goes through more boxes in a flurry of CUTS: FALSE PASSPORTS; a POLICE SCANNER; BODY ARMOR; HAND GUNS; large BAGS OF FERTILIZER; strange CHEMICALS; 747 MANUALS. Jerry looks around, fear and confusion growing. His cell rings.,. startles him -- all the LCD says is: \"ANSWER NOW.\" JERRY -- hello? A WOMAN'S VOICE. We can't place why... but it's really creepy. WOMAN'S VOICE Look out your window. They're coming for you. JERRY -- what? Who is this? WOMAN'S VOICE Jerry. You have to run. JERRY Who the hell is this?! Rips back the curtain to see a SWAT VAN SCREECHING UP -- a flack- jacketed TEAM pours out, assault rifles ready. Jerry goes pale. WOMAN'S VOICE Leave your residence. Get to the Mathis train station. You have 4 minutes. JERRY Jesus Christ -- what's happening?! WOMAN'S VOICE Run, or you'll be captured and convicted -- go NOW. CLICK. POUNDING BOOTS AGAINST PAVEMENT OUTSIDE. Jerry whirls, goes out to the hall, hears THEM coming. Starts to run. But a TACTICAL TEAM STORMS THE HALL. ASSAULT RIFLES AIMED AT HIM: TEAM LEADER JERRY Hands behind your head! DOWN WHAT'S GOING ON? HEY! IS NOW! DOWN ON THE FLOOR OR WE THIS ABOUT THE--THE ATM?! I WILL FIRE! DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! Jerry's SLAMMED to the ground as we CUT TO -- 3/28/07 19. INT. DHS FIELD OFFICE - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT Jerry sits cuffed to a table. Frightened, confused, on the defensive. The door opens and AGENT THOMAS MORGAN enters: 40s, born to the job, never smiles. Takes a seat, opens a \"file: JERRY Look, man, I don't know what this is -- I don't know how all that shit got in my apartment, but unless you're my lawyer-- MORGAN My condolences. I understand you've had a tough day. JERRY it hasn't been ideal. MORGAN Your brother worked for the State Department. This was almost a question. And while it's obviously news to us, Jerry clearly knew... JERRY You tell me. MORGAN Were you close? JERRY Why? What am I doing here. I don't even know who you are. Morgan tosses his black leather BADGE WALLET onto the metal table. It lands open with a substantial CLUNG! MORGAN Tom Morgan, Special Agent attached to the National Counterterrorism Center. JERRY Counterterrorism Center? You think I'm -- MORGAN -- according to phone records, your brother called you twelve times in the last year. You never called him back. JERRY If you're asking if we were the kind of freaky twins you see at the mall wearing the same shirt, no. Listen, Paul traveled a lot, so we didn't -- 3/28/07 20. CONTINUED: MORGAN Oh. That's right. He stamped visas in Karachi for a year. Then was a junior FSO in Beirut. Interesting places. JERRY What're you... saying. MORGAN I'm just saying you didn't talk much. maybe you did. JERRY Am I getting a lawyer here? 'Cause didn't hear my rights read to me-- MORGAN You familiar with the slogan, \"Declare War on War?\" JERRY what? No, why? Morgan pulls out a SURVEILLANCE PHOTO: Jerry, college-age, at a STUDENT RALLY holding up a sign with an image of the Pentagon crossed out in red: \"DECLARE WAR ON WAR!\" MORGAN Because you painted it when you were part of the student activist group \"Project Underground\" at Berkley. JERRY Wait. Come on -- okay: her name was Julia, she was the smokinist girl I'd ever seen and she wanted me -- I would've gone to an \"Anti-Oxygen\" rally for her. I swear to God, dude-- MORGAN Don't \"dude\" me. I'm not your friend. I don't have friends... so: Jerry. Why'd you drop out of school? JERRY Why'd you stay in? I don't know, I didn't really see the point. MORGAN You haven't been able to hold a job JERRY Unless I've been fired from Kinko's, which is a statistical impossibility, I'm holding a job right now. 21. 3/28/07 CONTINUED: (2) MORGAN Construction work, bartender in Singapore, telemarketing, real estate office, messenger, supermarket sign painter, taxi driver, gas station in Florida, fishing boat in Alaska-- JERRY -- what can I say?

JERRY Well hasn't that been the question my whole life. You know how I know Paul wasn't a terrorist? Because if he had been, he would've been the best fucking terrorist in history: he wouldn't have gotten caught, the United States would be a crater -- he would've won awards for being a great terrorist.

RACHEL She's going to KILL YOU! 3/28/07 43. CONTINUED: (4) And just then, something TERRIFYING: an IMMENSE POWER SURGE -- HEARD, FELT -- and a SIX-STORY-HIGH COIL THE SIZE OF AN SUV EXPLODES IN SPARKS. CABLES BLAST FREE. Rachel SCREAMS. Jerry TACKLES HER TO SAFETY as the tree trunk cables SWING DOWN AND STRIKE THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN and he is SLAMMED OFF HIS FEET, the current making the cable STICK TO HIM LIKE GLUE. And he's ON FIRE INSTANTLY -- SMOKE EVERYWHERE as he's TOSSED BY THE HORRIFYING TENTACLE, POUNDED INTO THE GROUND, BACK INTO THE AIR, PUMMELLED DOWN AGAIN, BURNING... Jerry and Rachel watch this in horror -- until she looks away. Jerry holding her -- the two in shock, strangers, in each - other's arms. Having shared another moment, too real, horror - RACHEL (CONT'D) JERRY. Oh my God... Oh God... oh We--we have to do something, God... Oh God... we have to... figure out what to.. what... And then his PHONE RINGS. And they're both too afraid to answer it. Another RING. And another. Finally Jerry answers it, hand shaking slightly: JERRY You killed him... you killed that man... WOMAN'S VOICE It was unavoidable. Take the van. Drive to Indianapolis. 7002 West 56th Street. Arrive no later than eleven AM. Disobey and you die. CLICK. Rachel's eyes on Jerry. JERRY RACHEL she wants us to drive to Indianapolis.: , -- why? What's there, what? -- -- I don't know -- -- no, this can't keep happening! We have to go to the police, explain it -- explain what?! What're we -- I'm not doing it!! I'm not gonna tell them?! going anywhere! Jerry can see she's losing it. Grabs her by the shoulders: JERRY -- Rachel. She's watching us. Right now. You wanna die too? Your son? We have to go. Rachel looks right at him, still shaking, knows he's right. And nods. Okay. Okay. As our MUSIC BUILDS, LARGER THAN YOU MIGHT THINK -- AND AT THE HEIGHT OF AN UNRESOLVED CHORD, IT -- 3/28/07 44. EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY -- STOPS. Just the eerie, faint whistle of wind. We PAN a barren landscape. Scattered scorch marks. Then, a high-pitched TONE as the PAN continues and arrives at a parked military truck, which gives us scale to understand the SUDDEN COLOSSAL EXPLOSION THAT SHAKES OUR BEING -- HOLY FUCK THAT THING WAS HUGE AND AS DEBRIS IS STILL RIPPED INTO THE SKY, PIECES ARE COMING DOWN AND THERE WILL BE SMOKE FOR HOURS as a SUPER APPEARS: \"BRIAR POINT TEST RANGE -- ABERDEEN, MARYLAND. \"- And we hear CLAPPING -- PULL BACK, realizing that we are inside: INT. PROTECTIVE BARRACKS - DAY -- a high-tech bunker-like structure with six-inch LEXAN WINDOWS. A dozen MILITARY BRASS are here, applauding. Among them is Callister. He seems more thoughtful about this. Behind him, a British, DARK-SUITED WEAPONS';DEVELOPER speaks: WEAPONS DEVELOPER That blast was the result of one single crystal of Hexomethylne. For those of you who are new today, \"Rex\" is an isotope that leaves no chemical markers -- it's eighty times more powerful than C4. Odorless. Undetectable. COLONEL THOMPSON, also from our opening, gestures: COLONEL THOMPSON Talk about the detonating system... The Developer screws a METAL VALVE into what looks like a can of compressed air, saying: WEAPONS DEVELOPER Hex is triggered by an acoustic frequency undetectable to the human ear. For this test we made it audible -- that was the tone you heard before the explosion -- the tone was the trigger. CALLISTER What's the risk that another sound could accidentally detonate it? A song on a radio? A howling dog? WEAPONS DEVELOPER No: the pitch is uniquely programmed and impossible to reproduce. 3/28/07 45 CONTINUED: COLONEL THOMPSON Fine job. WEAPONS DEVELOPER Thank you, sir. We're proud of this ordnance -- all of us at Halloway-Smith. And while we still HEAR HIM SPEAKING, we CUT TO: INT.

The arms package each into separate . containers, fit them with shipping labels marked: \"PENTAGON DIRECT.\" WEAPONS DEVELOPER (V.0.) (CONT'D) And we're hoping this moves us into the next scheduled phase... shipping the product into the field. Drift toward an unmanned computer. The screen FLICKERS: \"OVERRIDE IN PROGRESS,. CHANGE SHIPPING DESTINATION.\" Robot arms grab a wrapped package off the line. A new label's printed: \"ASHLAND & SONS CIO JERRY SHAW.\" INT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - DAY Latesha walking down a hallway. Endless miles of shiny marble and military paintings. Her CELL RINGS. It's Morgan: MORGAN (V.O.) Whaddya got? LATESHA Those funny things underneath my not-so- stylish pantsuit? They brought me all the way to the Pentagon. Paul Shaw wasn't State -- EXT. SKIES ABOVE CHICAGO - DAY A chopper ROARS over skyscrapers.

DOWN THE HALLWAY a PHALANX of GENERALS, MILITARY PERSONNEL and SCURRYING ASSISTANTS heading towards a set of DOUBLE-DOORS. Some very big meeting about to happen - LATESHA That's the point. No one'll tell me. I cross-reffed the SCI database, talked to the Intel committee, NSA gave me..nothing. Krebs doesn't want me to ruffle any feathers. I've been up and down all the ladders and everyone just thinks I'm a -- WHEN an MP suddenly appears and grabs her by the arm. Stopping her. He towers over her -- MP Interns aren't allowed on this floor, miss. You'll have to -- When Latesha wearily flashes him her I.D. I've got clearance, pal. He looks at it. Lets her arm go.

A HUGE:PAINTING of the battle of EL-ALAMEIN looming behind her. Shelooks..back down the hallway as all the BRASS heading into the MEETING ROOM and catches sight of -- CALLISTER amongst them. Latesha hesitates. For just a second. Shit. Shit. This is it. Before suddenly rushing forward and calling out -- LATESHA Secretary Callister!.: He looks behind him briefly before being shuffled into the meeting room. And SLAM.. The doors close in Latesha's face. LATESHA (CONT'D) Well, shit. INT. DRY CLEANING VAN - CITY STREETS - INDIANAPOLIS - DAY The van speeds down a highway, passing a sign: \"WELCOME TO INDIANAPOLIS: YOUR HOME TOWN!\" Jerry drives, pensive. Rachel stares out the-window, the shock of what she's seen only fueling her rage at the whole situation. JERRY how old is he? Your son. RACHEL Kyle. He's nine. JERRY What's he doing on a train? She really doesn't want to talk. BUT: 3/28/07 48. CONTINUED: RACHEL He goes to a music magnet. His school's on a tour of Washington. They're playing at the Kennedy Center. JERRY wow. And you. Hm.

RACHEL Then what's with the qualified nod? JERRY I'm not allowed to nod? RACHEL Not if you're iudging me.-- JERRY. Judging?! I'm just making conversation. RACHEL You think I should have gone with him anyway. JERRY I'm just thinking, sounds like a big deal, especially for a 9-year-old -- playing at the Kennedy Center -- I'd just think at least one parent might wanna be there to see it. RACHEL Yeah? How do you know Kyle's dad isn't there? JERRY Well, you're not wearing a ring and you haven't mentioned anyone but your son is on that train. Even the most pissed off ex-wife -- which I'm not saying you aren't -- would've mentioned it if her ex's life was threatened -- and if Kyle was going to meet his dad in DC? You would've tried to call him, too. So where is he? Kyle's dad? 3/28/07 49. CONTINUED: (2) RACHEL As if it's any of your business -- you know what you are --? JERRY Insightful? Intuitive? A better driver than you --? RACHEL -- you're one of those \"thirties are the new twenties\" man-children.

Jerry YANKS the wheel hard, PEELING across four lanes of traffic. SKIDS to a stop by a curb, pops open the door. RACHEL JESUS!--WHAT'RE YOU D--?'. Jerry gets out, SLAMS his door shut -- 3/28/07 50. CONTINUED: (3) RACHEL (CONT'D) You can't leave me! JERRY Why not? My brother's a terrorist, and I'm a loser right? He starts to walk away. Rachel desperately opening her door RACHEL Don't walk away! JERRY I'm done. RACHEL Please! JERRY You're on your own. Rachel starts running after him,panicked, leadin : RACHEL Please! PLEASE! I..i need you! Jerrystops short. Turning around. Cupping his ear. JERRY I'm sorry? What'd you just say? RACHEL I can't do this without you. JERRY You mean without the \"man-child?\" Rachel's reserves crumble. RACHEL Its the first time we've been apart, me and Kyle. Since the day he was born. And I let him get on that train-- -- I let him get on. Jerry sees all the panic and horror and guilt in this woman's eyes. They're both in pain. Points his finger right at her. JERRY No more accusing my brother of shit you know nothing about, is that understood? Rachel looks at him. Nods. Finding her voice again -- 3/28/07 51. CONTINUED: (4) RACHEL Yes. And so. They turn around. And get back in the van. EXT. TOWER 108 - DAY THE CHARRED FACE OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN, FROZEN IN A SCREAM. Morgan runs towards it, the SHERIFF and a POWER WORKER trying to keep up. Chopper in B.G. Police officers work the scene. POWER WORKER Never seen anything like it. Power blew out from Franklin High School down to the river club. I can't explain it - They arrive at the body. Contorted, blackened, teeth bared. SHERIFF No I.D. We know he's male, though. Probably in his 20's. Tire treads entering and leaving the scene over three. Three sets of shoe prints. MORGAN And we're about 4 miles from the river -- Just then we see Agent Grant running towards them, stumbling on some rocks. Just finishing-.up a cell call: AGENT GRANT Agent Morgan!\" Just got off with HQ. The fake fax from Justice that got Shaw his phone call? Came from inside Justice. MORGAN Inside?! You absolutely sure on that? AGENT GRANT Yes, s-- Yes I am. MEDICAL EXAMINER Got something -- As the M.E. pulls something out of Middle Eastern Man's ear: a small, charred GIZMO. Small WIRE sticking out. Lifts it up for them to see. Morgan takes the TWEEZERS -- GRANT Looks like a bone mic, military grade. 3/28/07 52. CONTINUED: MORGAN Can't even get these things on the black market. Someone was talking to him. Something's rotten in Denmark. No, something's rotten everywhere. Morgan turns abruptly and starts back for the chopper. The Sheriff helplessly calls after him: SHERIFF We'll be needing that for evidence! EXT. 56TH STREET - DAY Jerry and Rachel's van pulls up to THE FEDERAL BANK OF INDIANAPOLIS. Across the way is a STADIUM for the COLTS. The parking lot's full, mid-game. They stare;.steeling themselves for the inevitable... RACHEL a Federal bank? JERRY Could be worse. Could.be.a Federal Prison. INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE -;LOBBY - DAY A wall-mounted clock ticks to \"11:00\"--WHIP TO Jerry and Rachel entering. Security cams everywhere. As they nervously cross the floor, they pass TWO ARMED BRINKS COURIERS entering an elevator. A BANK MANAGER APPROACHES: MANAGER Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? I'm Mr. Bids. I understand you're in a hurry, why don't I show you to your box. JERRY yes, thank you, we'd... like that. The manager walks them across to a secure elevator with a THERMOGRAPHIC SCANNER. The manager looks at Jerry expectantly, waiting for him to place his hand on it. He does: a flash of light, identifying him as: \"SAXON, CARL.\" Jerry's eyes: this is madness. The elevator doors OPEN. INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - VAULT - DAY They exit the elevator, the manager leads them to a DEPOSIT BOX. He pulls out a metal key, identical to the one the Middle Eastern Man gave Jerry: 3/28/07 53. CONTINUED: MANAGER Your key? Jerry takes out his key, it fits perfectly. They turn; the box slides out, the manager lays it on a steel table. LEAVES to give them privacy. Jerry and Rachel stare at the box. RACHEL You gonna open it? JERRY Maybe it's not gonna be so bad. RACHEL Yeah... maybe it's something good.. They meet eyes. Tentatively, he raises the lid to find TWO GLOCK PISTOLS and the same BONE MIC we saw.the.M.E. pull out of the Middle Eastern Man's ear. A note.: \"EAR:MIC. NOW.\" JERRY RACHEL Oh, shit -- it's bad -- They look at each other. Jerry puts the..mic in his ear: WOMAN'S VOICE OVER MIC Both guns are loaded, safety's off. In sixty seconds,':two,men Will exit the adjacent vault carrying a briefcase. Take it -- by force if necessary -- then exit the building.. Jerry can't fucking believe this. Rachel dying to know: RACHEL -- what?! JERRY -- I don't suppose -- there's any easier way to`get whatever the hell it is you want -- is there? Miss? But she's not answering. JERRY (CONT'D) Excellent. RACHEL What now -- what are we? BUT THE VAULT NEXT DOOR OPENS, FOOTSTEPS-- 3/28/07 54.

The footsteps come CLOSER as two MEN appear... the.-BRINKS COURIERS from the lobby; one of them's carrying a METALLIC BRIEFCASE cuffed to his wrist -- the other spots Jerry's gun and REACTS, going for his gun: JERRY Don't! The men freeze -- Jerry holds his gun awkwardly -- JERRY (CONT'D) Uh... hi. How's it going. Put. it on the floor. The briefcase. We don't wanna hurt you guys, we like you guys -- just -- we need the case. COURIER #1 You're bringing a shitstorm on your heads, you know that. JERRY I think we're already mid-shitstorm. Do it. The men exchange glances. Reluctantly, Courier #1 punches a combination into the case's padlock, the cuff POPS free from his wrist. He slides it over to Jerry, who reaches for it... AND COURIER #2 MAKES A MOVE -- SMASHING Jerry back, knocking the gun out of his hand.. Jerry CRASHES to the ground, the BONE MIC falling out of his ear... he turns, shit! Sees it skitter under the table. The Courier sees it too and grabs his chance: snatches up the case and RUNS for the elevator -- Rachel rushes him, trips him -- he falls, dazed -- Jerry leaps up but Courier #2 effortlessly FLIPS him on top of the steel table, SLAMS Jerry's head into the counter, unholsters a back-up GUN from his ankle -- brings the barrel up as: BAM! A GUNSHOT! The Couriers spin to see RACHEL, holding the gun that was kicked across the floor: RACHEL DROP THE GUN ASSHOLE! Courier #2 drops it; Jerry rises, wipes blood from his lip. Rachel is fucking on fire, she's so tough. AKA: a mother. 3/28/07 55. CONTINUED: (3) RACHEL (CONT'D) Gimme the case. Now. They do -- and Jerry and Rachel back into the elevator with it. JERRY RACHEL impressive. Thanks. The door closes on them, and we CUT INTO: INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - ELEVATOR - DAY Alone in the elevator, Jerry looks down at the.. case, adrenaline coursing, sees a ribbon-thin DIGITAL TIMER near the handle: \"01:12:36. 01:12:35.\" RACHEL JERRY -- whoa--what is that? -- a timer -- it's counting down-- -- they do.that -- what's it mean?! -- I dunno, the only things with timers I can think of are microwaves and... -- and bombs, you were gonna say bombs -- some coffee makers have timers.. .and egg timers... -- yeah, Jerry, it's an egg timer -- What is SHE saying about it --? I dunno, I -- -- What do you mean you. don't know?! WOMAN'S VOICE You lost the mic, Jerry. That's not optimum. JESUS CHRIST! Her voice is in the elevator now: JERRY Would you stop doing that?! WOMAN'S VOICE There will thirty five seconds of disconnect, during which you need to get yourselves across the street to the stadium's VIP parking area unexposed. JERRY Is this a bomb?! 'Cause I am not walking out with a bomb! Hey! You! But she's done talking. As the elevator DOORS SLIDE OPEN-- 3/28/07 56 INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - DAY TWO MORE BRINKS COURIERS wait by an armored truck. Jerry and Rachel exit, trying to look casual. Hearts POUNDING -- RACHEL How do I look? JERRY Like you got into a fight. Me? RACHEL Like you lost one. AN ALARM SOUNDS. The men race into the bank as Jerry and Rachel walk RIGHT PAST them, starting across the street toward the stadium. No one in sight except a COLTS PARAPHERNALIA VENDOR. SQUAD CARS SCREECH in around the bank. COPS jump out drawing their weapons. Rachel tensing. JERRY Just keep walking Jerry looks at the CLOCK above the-stadium. Then over his shoulder at the BANK. Steers Rachel over towards the VENDOR. Trying to stay calm. JERRY (CONT'D) Two jerseys and two hats, please -- VENDOR Peyton or Vinatieri? JERRY I don't know what that means -- RACHEL Jerry... JERRY Uh... both. The two COURIERS running out of the bank. POINTING RIGHT AT JERRY AND RACHEL ACROSS THE STREET. Everyone starts RUNNING TOWARD THEM. Jerry shoves a jersey and hat at Rachel-- JERRY (CONT'D) Put these on -- RACHEL JER-- JERRY Do it! 3/28/07 57 CONTINUED: They put on the hats and jerseys, hurrying towards the stadium. Cops screaming at them to stop, the Vendor screaming that they didn't pay. The cops fan out. Cars SCREECH to a stop. Jerry, sweating. Flicks another look at the stadium clock: 3.. 2.. 1: WHEN WHAM! THE STADIUM DOORS FLY OPEN AS THOUSANDS OF JOYOUS COLTS FANS POUR OUT WEARING IDENTICAL BLUE HATS AND JERSEYS. The game's over. And in an instant, Jerry and Rachel are lost in a sea of blue and white -- it's impossible to spot them. Pushed back by the throng the COPS lose sight of them -- Jerry takes Rachel's arm, working against the current towards the VIP parking area. A LIMO WAITING THERE. The CHAUFFEUR sees them, hurriedly puts down his paper. Opening the door -- CHAUFFEUR Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? Hope you-enjoyed the game. JERRY Thanks, uh, we're in kind of a hurry -- CHAUFFEUR I bet. Jerry reacts, confused by the.chauffeur's libidinous tone as he closes the back door. They vanish behind tinted windows as cops and agents pass right by them. And as the limo pulls out, we reveal, etched across the rear: \"JUST MARRIED.\" EXT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - DAY Latesha sits next to the DOUBLE DOORS. Laptop open, typing madly. She's been waiting a long, long time -- WHEN SUDDENLY they burst open and she SNAPS to her feet. Standing expectantly as GENERAL after GENERAL files out of the situation room. Each as tall and broad as the next -- LATESHA Afternoon... afternoon, sir... afternoon... afternoon, General... Pretty intimidating. Finally CALLISTER walks out, flanked by ADVISORS. The weight of the world's on his shoulders. LATESHA (CONT'D) Secretary Callister? He looks back, preoccupied. She catches up, holding her ID: LATESHA (CONT'D) Latesha Simms, DHS, level 2 clearance. I need to ask you a question, sir -- 3/28/07 58. CONTINUED: CALLISTER Not now, you can direct it to my office. LATESHA It'll only take a minute, sir, thirty seconds -- B-36? Can you tell me what it is? 'Cause its not -- CALLISTER -- you don't have clearance, Agent Simms, and I don't have thirty seconds. LATESHA So should I assume it has something to. do with the four CVN class 21 aircraft carriers you and the president just ordered to the Strait of Hormuz -? He looks at her, stunned. How the hell--? LATESHA (CONT'D) I just checked the intel, sir, we have some of the same indexes -- CALLISTER You need to stop assuming. And he moves on. Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling like a mouse in cage filled with lions. Until she ROARS: LATESHA Secretary Callister. Voice echoing down the hail. Callister stops short, stunned by the gall and volume of this woman. She weaves through the GENERALS, planting herself in front of him: LATESHA (CONT'D) My Department's tracking a home-grown terrorist on the loose as we speak who may be connected to a cell with ties inside this building. Now seeing as you just had a meeting back there with more brass than the Navy Marching Band and with the terror threat rising every three hours, I'm going to just have to assume you're in the middle of a very delicate dance to stave off World War Three... so with all due respect, you either give me my thirty seconds and tell me what the hell B-36 is, or this world just fell into an even bigger heap of trouble. Sir. Callister looks down at her, completely struck dumb. She's hit a chord deep inside him. It's called balls. SLAM TO: 3/28/07 59. INT. LOBBY - FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - DAY As Jerry and Rachel enter the POSH LOBBY of the FOUR SEASONS, an obsequious BELLHOP approaches -- he's been waiting for them: BELLHOP Mr. and Mrs. Saxon?

PENTAGON - ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY Latesha dumps her things on a tray, moves through a scanner -- among her items is a set of KEYS with aMINI.SWISS ARMY KNIFE.

The \"DING\" of an arriving elevator MATCHES US BACK TO: INT. PENTAGON ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS THE LEVEL INDICATOR, having just arrived at floor \"B-35.\" Latesha, wedged between two PENTAGON GUARDS, watches nervously as one of them uses a KEY to open a PANEL revealing: A BIOMETRIC SENSOR. The other guard holds his thumb to the scanner -- yet another PANEL OPENS, with a RED BUTTON marked \"B- 36.\" It hits Latesha: B-36 is a secret level in the Pentagon. The elevator DESCENDS to the final level and OPENS, revealing: 3/28/07 60. INT. HALLWAY - LEVEL B-36 - CONTINUOUS 12-foot concrete walls. High-tech ventilation and surveillance system. Standing there waiting is SCOTT BOWMAN, early thirties, hasn't seen daylight in a while: SCOTT Agent Simms? Scott Bowman: Welcome to B- 36. If you'll follow me? INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - FOUR SEASONS - CONTINUOUS The Bellhop dramatically opens the door -- BELLHOP Welcome to paradise. Palatial HONEYMOON SUITE. Picture windows, rose petals on the bed...

On screen, a narrated \"virtual tour\".of the hotel: TV VOICE dedicated to the highest standards of luxury and comfort... BELLHOP Robes behind the door, jacuzzi with eighteen nozzles that hit in all the right places, if you'll pardon my French. .Need anything, just dial zero, I'm here t2. serve, I'm here to please... And he stands by the door, waiting for a tip. Jerry's still looking aroundwhen Rachel catches his eye. Well? Oh. Jerry digs into his pocket and pulls out TWO NICKELS. JERRY Knock yourself out. The Bellhop is still looking down at his palm when Jerry SHUTS THE DOOR on him. RACHEL This is nice and everything, but what the hell are we doing here? 3/28/07 61. CONTINUED: JERRY Nice? One night in this place is more than one of my paychecks; and that's before taxes -- He heads over to the minibar. Starts rooting through it, pulling out those tiny bottles of alcohol... RACHEL What're you doing? JERRY If we're going down, I'm gonna go down singing. Hey! Chocolate covered almonds, I love these! RACHEL Can you stop eating for a second? A KNOCK at the door and they stop arguing immediately. WOMAN'S VOICE Answer it. They TURN hearing the voice: it's.coming from the T.V. The FOUR SEASONS GRAPHIC still dancing on screen. WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) There are items you will need for the next step. KNOCK! KNOCK! A small nod from Rachel and Jerry opens the door. A DELIVERY BOY stands there with a BAG: DELIVERY BOY There y'go, Mr. Saxon. Have a nice day? Jerry takes the bag -- the kid puts out his hand for a tip just as Jerry closes the door on him, dazed. Starts pulling things from the bag: hair. dye, clothes... WOMAN'S VOICE The limousine is waiting for you `downstairs. You have 30 minutes to change your appearance. RACHEL Where are we going now?

Furious, he moves to.the WINDOW -- JERRY (:CONT'D) Fine, have it your way,.Lady -- I'm gonna scream bloody murder out this window 'til every cop in a fifty mile radius comes running and I'm gonna tell them everything even if they think I'm a crazy sonofabitch 'cause at least I won't have to listen to you any more! RACHEL -- JERRY -- He YANKS the window up -- WOMAN'S VOICE STOP. He does. The..FOUR SEASONS GRAPHIC in TV snaps to BLACK -- then DIGITAL STATIC -- a channel RE-ROUTING through some distant computer-controlled network. And now: IMAGES -- FILE FOOTAGE -- a DEFENSE DEPARTMENT LAB, TECHNICIANS assembling computer components, putting together a strange- looking SPHERE -- WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) My name... is Aria.

FLICKERING SHADOWS play across her face-- SCOTT (O.S.) It stands for 'Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Analyst'... And we reveal \"THE TANK.\" A glassed-in wall containing TONS of water. AN AWESOME STEEL SPHERE IN THE WATER, suspended by a claw-like apparatus. The \"brain\" of a com uter network. The very same image Jerry and Rachel just saw on the TV. SCOTT (CONT'D) Twenty-two hundred tons of super-cooled water keeps her from overheating -- that's ninety-two thousand processors, the equivalent of a hundred.millionhuman brains working together as:,.one...\"' LATESHA an electronic espionage system. SCOTT No, that was Echelon, eavesdropping off satellites. This goes.;. much farther. INT.

I have access to track the economies, populations, and military development of every country in the world, as well as intercept all global communications -- from satellites to cell phones to credit card transactions. Jerry and Rachel look at each other -- a computer?! INT. MAINFRAME TANK - LEVEL B-36 - CONTINUOUS SCOTT After 911, our problem wasn't collecting data, it was interpreting it fast enough. Ergo: quantum rocessin 3/28/07 64. CONTINUED: SCOTT (CONT'D) Today there are more microchips than people, and they can all be data-mined, either via direct connectivity or wireless signals --let's say we're chasing someone with a suitcase nuke in L.A., we can order Aria to shut down mass transit, track the perp through traffic cameras... and if given the order, she could even turn a TV into a bomb to take him out. LATESHA (what we're all THINKING) But what if -- SCOTT -- she can't act without authorization. See, she's bound not to countermand our laws -- even the Declaration of Independence is woven into her source code. Her primary role's pre-emptive -- running simulations, identifying threats before they become real... INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - CONTINUOUS JERRY Wait, you think we're a.threat? ARIA (V.0.) No. You're a means to an end. On TV, CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS -- ZOOM to words in CLOSE UP: ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) Under National Security Directive 359, Sub-Section 72 -- \"when units are needed for the national defense, civilians shall be ordered to active Federal service...\" JERRY you're drafting us? RACHEL The guy you killed in the desert -- last time I checked, murder wasn't legal. ARIA In fact, it is. Chapter 802 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice states desertion is punishable by death. So matter-of-fact, its chilling. And what Jerry wants to know, more than anything, is... 3/28/07 65. CONTINUED: JERRY what'd my brother have to do with this? A picture of PAUL SHAW'S DEFENSE I.D. pops on screen: ARIA We were colleagues. Rachel staring at the picture on the screen, then back at Jerry. Can see the blood draining from his face. JERRY No, he worked for the State Department..: ARIA Everyone in deep operations has a cover. Your brother was a Horseman. JERRY What's the hell is a 'Horseman'? INT. MAINFRAME TANK - CONTINUOUS SCOTT You know, clever allegory -- of the apocalypse'--`except we're here to prevent it. Scott taps the console, ID PHOTOS APPEAR of our four \"Horsemen\": PAUL SHAW, SCOTT, and two men we'll call LOWELL and JIMMY. SCOTT (CONT'D) Officially, we don't exist, but we monitor Aria's network 24/7. There were :four of us... til Paul died. He was smarter than all of us put together. LATESHA Working here must be pretty tough -- all the security, the pressure, long hours... As in: \"Did you notice him acting strangely?\" SCOTT Yeah, but you could set your watch by Paul. Except... LATESHA Except what? 3/28/07 66 CONTINUED: SCOTT The night he died? He left his shift three minutes early. Which you don't do. Which he wouldn't do. Latesha's suddenly locked in on a clue -- PRELAP: ARIA (V.0.) Paul and I had a disagreement before he expired... INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - CONTINUOUS Jerry sinks to the edge of the bed, runs hands: through his hair: ARIA To amend it, I need Jerry to perform a task. Simple. JERRY (V.0.) Expired?! You mean died.. That's what we call it, we humans, we call it dying-- RACHEL What's the task? ARIA (V.0.) To insure the national security of the United States. RACHEL What d'you need me for then? ARIA (V.0.) That is not your concern right now. RACHEL Are you kidding me? JERRY Alright, this is bullshit. I'm not doing this --- and you're a computer, you don't know a goddamn thing about my brother. ARIA (V.0.) I know all about him, Jerry. And you. The screen snaps to a SLIDE SHOW of PAUL SHAW'S accomplishments: childhood birthday parties, sports teams, surrounded by friends, beautiful girlfriends, high school graduation, Yale graduation, standing with their dad, William's arm over his shoulder. Jerry almost GASPS at Aria's reaching into his subconscious: ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) Your brother succeeded in everything he did. 3/28/07 67. CONTINUED: ARIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Before he was a year old, he walked. Something that took you eighteen months to accomplish. He was highly gifted, intelligent and principled -- in fact, the only Horseman ever to challenge me. But you, Jerry -- The slide show CHANGES to SECURITY FOOTAGE of Jerry at KINKO'S, slaving away. Playing cards with Kwame, slacking off. His stomach drops. Seeing himself like this. Looking so pathetic. The heart has just been cut out of him. Rachel sees it -- ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) You are similar to Paul in DNA only. Historically you have succeeded in nothing. Initiated nothing. Excelled in nothing. You will perform the task because it is your nature to follow. And because you've seen what happens to deserters. RACHEL -- Jesus, ENOUGH! The screen goes BLACK. ARIA (V.0.:) You have 23 minutes to prepare. There's an adjoining suite with a second bathroom. The DOOR to the adjoining SUITE clicks open. ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) Use it. And she's gone, replaced by the hotel's promotional prattle -- TV VOICE The Four Seasons prides itself on excellent service Jerry stares, overcome. Rachel watches him an emotional beat... RACHEL Jerry? Without answering, he grabs the bag. Walks into the other room without a word. Closes the door. She stares, feeling his shame... then her eyes go to the BRIEFCASE TIMER counting down: \"01:08:43.. 01:08:42... 01:08:41...\" 3/28/07 68.

INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - DAY The bank's roped off and labelled \"CRIME AREA.\" Morgan questions the Couriers, studies their transport manifest: MORGAN Biotech? The chemical company? BRINKS COURIER #2 When they make a new compound, they, hold it in a vault for clinical trials. MORGAN Why'd the HAZMAT office issue a special permit for the case? BRINKS COURIER #1 You'd have to ask -- could be` anything from a boner pill to a bioweapon, they never tell us. BRINKS COURIER #2 Tell you one thing, though... the guy never handled a gun before. That LANDS with Morgan. He nods to an agent, dismissing the couriers. Grant approaches: AGENT GRANT We pulled video... nothing. No good angles on Shaw or the girl. MORGAN There.are 14 visible cameras in the lobby! \" 8 hidden no one can see! AGENT GRANT Gotta be a hacker, someone keeping them ahead of us. MORGAN It's a Federal bank; encryption doesn't get more secure.., from now on assume our air's been compromised, too.

CONTINUED: AGENT GRANT I'm on it -- also: they found this upstairs, but the trace signal's dead -- Holds up an evidence bag with Jerry's BONE MIC inside. MORGAN Do not tell me that is what I think it is. Goddamnit, who's leading these people around?! Someone's behind the Wizard of Oz! He turns and spots something: A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in the window of a 7-11. Starts MOVING toward it.-- INT. BATHROOM - FOUR SEASONS - DAY Rachel's face WHIPS UP INTO FRAME, her hair now DYED BLONDE.

RACHEL -- sweetie, where areou, are you -- But she's INTERRUPTED as she realizes, oddly, it's a VOICEMAIL -- her heart SINKS: KYLE (V.O.) Got your message, the train's awesome -- Brian tried to burp the alphabet but gagged when he got to \"M.\" I'll call when we hit D.C. Bye, ma -- Rachel holding the phone like it's some kind of life-line to her son. When there's a strange BEEP then the voice of ARIA: ARIA Your son left that message sixty seconds ago. RACHEL I'll do whatever you want -- don't hurt him, please -- I'm begging you. Listen - you're trying to protect something too, right? You'll do whatever it takes. Well that's what it's like to be a mother -- can you understand that? 3/28/07 70. CONTINUED: ARIA There were over 52,000 vocal tone options for my program; I chose this one precisely because it sounds so maternal. People tend to do what you ask when you sound like their mother. RACHEL Jesus... ARIA You'll see your son again soon. Bute there's something I require from you first... EXT. BATHROOM - SAME Jerry approaches the door, hair now BROWN. Beat. He knocks: JERRY Rachel? We gotta go INTERCUT: Rachel in the bathroom, her face betraying the horror of what she's just heard, what Aria's just told her to do -- RACHEL What? No way, I can't just -- ARIA -- when the time comes I'll instruct you to stepaway:fromJerry. Once you hear those words, you'll have thirty seconds. JERRY (V.0.) Rachel? You in there? ARIA Answer Jerry, please. INTERCUT:;Jerry still standing outside the door. Rachel's VOICE,\"mustering strength through the door: RACHEL (V.0.) COMING) Steeling herself, she steps out.

Girl's gotta groom. INT. 7-11 - BACK ROOM - DAY Morgan's on the other end, Grant and the Clerk run through a playback of the CCTV FEEDS looking out onto the street in front of 7-11. Good old-fashioned VCR. MORGAN -- you're shitting me INT.

You're breaking up -- WITH LATESHA -- her cell LCD says: \"Call lost.\" No bars. Muttering \"dainnit,\" she tries to call Morgan back. No dice.

Do you want me to head over there? -- but Morgan's only half-listening now as he sees. something on the CCTV feeds: MORGAN Wait -- go back, freeze that - WHAT HE SEES: A STILL of Jerry and Rachel getting in the limo, faces obscured. MORGAN (CONT.':D) Punch up the plate The image enhances, revealing a PLATE NUMBER, its frame bearing the company name: \"ICON LIMOUSINE SERVICES.\" MORGAN (CONT'D) Find that car! Simms, gotta jump, sit tight 'til I call. LATESHA Yes, sir. Morgan, preoccupied, is about to hang up. But stops: did she just call me sir? INT. MAINFRAME TANK - B-36 - DAY Latesha returns to the NETWORK MONITORING HUB to find Scott typing at.the console. A MACHINE ARM drops down from above, spider-like.: The device animates as a CRANIAL SCANNER opens: SCOTT Aria's system uses biometric security to identify us, so only Horsemen can access her core programming. Suddenly his head's ensconced in a LASER GRID that scans every inch of his features: \"PROCESSING FOR MATCH... HORSEMAN IDENT CONFIRMED: BOWMAN, SCOTT.\" Latesha watches somewhat dumbstruck as the machine arm retreats upward. SCOTT (CONT'D) Aria, go voice active, please. 3/26/07 73 CONTINUED: ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) Hello, Scott. How may I assist you? LATESHA It talks? ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.)

Aria, I'd like to:bring,up all the log feeds the night Paul died -- when he left the building. ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) Of course. Scott types on the console and after a BEAT grainy black-and- white SURVEILLANCE FEED springs up onto the big MONITOR. Several different angles Of PAUL SHAW exiting the mainframe tank, moving down corridors, getting in the elevator. Weird to see this TINTYPE of Jerry. Same eyes, same hair, same walk. Flicks a quick look up at the camera -- LATESHA There's no feed from inside here? SCOTT No need for cameras in here, we've got Aria. Latesha looks through a glass divider at Aria floating in the tank. Creeped out. The FOOTAGE JUMPING as Paul rounds the corner for the elevator. Presses his THUMB to the panel. SCOTT (V.0.) (CONT'D) So weird... no overt body language, he's even casual. Leaving like it's any other day. 3/28/07 74. CONTINUED: (2) LATESHA Except three minutes early... ON THE MONITOR: the elevator doors open and Paul steps inside. Latesha studies the feed. Something's not right. Then... her eyes NARROW: the way Paul's facing the button panel. Like he's deliberately pivoting away from the camera. LATESHA (CONT'D) Wait, in the reflection, did you see that? Scott rewinds the FOOTAGE, ZOOMS IN. Paul stepping into the elevator and facing the button panel. CLOSE ON HIS FACE in the panel's REFLECTIVE SURFACE -- SCOTT Is he... blinking? Yes. Erratically, deliberately. Fucking weird. Scott and Latesha share a look. Suddenly, the image on the monitor starts to FLICKER and JUMP -- ARIA. OVER SPEAKER (V.O.) I'm experiencing interference in network 7752B, please allow me to shut down and analyze. SCOTT Negative, I'm prioritizing this. ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) I'll note my protest in the data log. This is getting weirder by the second -- PAUL'S DISTORTED REFLECTION in the panel, his eyes definitely blinking weirdly: LATESHA It's like he's trying to say something... SCOTT A code. He's blinking code LATESHA It's not Morse, but there's a sequence to it -- SCOTT Oh, that sonofabitch... He grabs a piece of paper and starts WRITING MADLY, scribbling numbers, scratching some out, then converting them to LETTERS -- F... I. 3/28/07 75 CONTINUED: (3) SCOTT (CONT'D) It's a code -- Hexadecimal -- a number system that can be converted to letters the first computer used it as a programming language back in the 50's. Latesha watches, rapt: R... E. E... X... T. .\" ON THE FEED: the elevator door OPENS and Paul steps out. That's all they get. They stare, trying to make sense of the letters: \"F.. I. R... E... E.. X... T.. .\" SCOTT (CONT'D The hell is that? Staring, minds spinning -- and suddenly.she puts.a FINGER between the two \"E's.\" Dividing words.. And GETS IT: EXT. CORRIDOR - SECONDS LATER MOVING FAST together down the same corridor Paul went down. They turn a corner... and STOP DEAD:- A FIRE EXTINGUISHER is mounted on the wall. Latesha sees the placement of the CAMERAS caddy-corner to the intersecting hallways... and knows what Paul was doing: LATESHA It's the only spot in the hallway not covered by .the cameras. (LOW):: He was hiding something from her. A SHIFT to ARIA CAM confirms it: she can't see exactly what they're doin Latesha moves urgently to the extinguisher, starts examining it for something, anything... but finds NOTHING. LATESHA (CONT'D) I don't get it. He had to be saying 'Fire Extinguisher.' Scott pulls a MAINTENANCE SHEET off the wall. Scans -- SCOTT Maintenance replaced it yesterday. This isn't right... they weren't supposed to do it til June. They lock eyes. 3/28/07 76. CONTINUED: LATESHA She read the code too... where's 'Recyling'? EXT. LIMO - DAY The limo glides through traffic. In back, Rachel's nodded off. Jerry watches her from across the limo, sketching something on a cocktail napkin... RACHEL'S FACE. It's a perfect, beautiful rendering. And we sense something in his look too-- something's changed. As Rachel wakes with a start -- RACHEL Hey -- sorry, I didn't mean to -- am I drooling? I bet I'm drooling. You didn't sleep? JERRY Night shifts. I'm used to. Rachel sits up, sees the napkin. Grins, surprised. RACHEL Wow, is that me? JERRY One of my only party tricks. RACHEL It's really good. Jerry looks down at it, not used to having his work appreciated. Rachel, can see how deeply affected he was by what Aria said. It seems to make her feel uuiilty somehow... kinder... RACHEL (CONT'D) About what Aria said... I'm sorry. They're;starting to connect. He glances out the window... JERRY You have to understand, I wasn't his twin, I was more like his... little brother. Always trying to catch up. And you wouldn't believe how... nice he was to me. Teaching me things when we were kids, telling me how great I was. He was the only one who ever did. Of course he was involved in some super secret National Security project. He was a superstar. He had a rocket strapped to his back. I'm the fuck-up. 3/28/07 77. CONTINUED: JERRY (CONT'D) I wear it like a medal, like it actually means something... but the funny thing is? This is probably the most important thing I'll ever do. This. Right now. This completely insane journey or whatever it is. I'm actually needed in something, me. Jerry Shaw is required. But what am I thinking? I'll probably fuck this up, too -- RACHEL You're being too hard on yourself-- JERRY No. I'm not being hard enough. That's been the problem. They look at each other. A real moment for Jerry. A seismic shift in his life perspective. But then something catches his eye -- his look DARKENS. Out the window, a highway sign: \"DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.\" The driver's.tinted divider window lowers, he offers a folder. CHAUFFEUR Your passports and itinerary. Now Rachel's seen the airport. sign, too. Looks at Jerry... JERRY Uh... could you give us a minute? The Chauffeur nods, the window RISES again. Heart pounding, Jerry grabs the briefcase and slides back the timer sheath to check the countdown: \"00:15:36...00:15:35...\" RACHEL You don't think -- JERRY -- we know what she can do, she doesn't need us to crash a plane -- RACHEL -- what if it's not about just one plane? They look at each other. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What to do. When Rachel grabs the briefcase as the limo pulls curbside. RACHEL (CONT'D) I have more to lose in this. If anything happens to Kyle then my life's over anyway -- But Jerry grabs her hand, taking the case. 3/28/07 78. CONTINUED: (2) JERRY Rachel -- til we met, I had nothing to lose. We do this together. A LONG LOOK BETWEEN THEM. As they realize, this could be it. INT. DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS We FEEL the heightened state of alert. NATIONAL GUARDSMEN with M-16's scan the crowd. Jerry and Rachel enter, adrenaline pumping -- he opens the envelope to reveal two PASSPORTS with their photos, but the names \"MARK and ALLISON ACKERMAN.\" JUST THEN Aria's VOICE comes over the P.A.: ARIA OVER P.A. Allison Ackerman, please pick up the white courtesy phone -- They stop, hearing her. Rachel TENSES in this moment moves to the RINGING courtesy phone, answers: ARIA (V.0.)

Jerry nervously sets it on the conveyor belt, they pull off their shoes... watch the case move toward the mouth of the machine, then pass through the metal detector, catching a GLIMPSE of the X-RAY SCREEN... the briefcase glides into view... A STRANGE GLITCH as the screen fritzes, then normalizes revealing the contents: A HAIR DRYER AND DIRTY CLOTHES?! They notice the surveillance cam watching: RACHEL she changed the screen... The case comes off the conveyor, the TSA agent hands it back: TSA AGENT Can't be too careful. JERRY You're doing a great job.

They leap onto the SLIDEWALK which starts ACCELERATING as they run -- travellers gawk as Jerry and Rachel race by -- they reach the end but are going so fast.that they're JETTISONED off the conveyor, TUMBLING into passengers. Agents run onto the slidewalk but it SUDDENLY BRAKES, JERKING them off their feet -- they're LAUNCHED into the air, a domino- effect of crashing people.` Jerry and Rachel pull themselves up and run toward gate 17-C, another screen CHANGES: TAKE THE EMERGENCY EXIT. Above a door, the \"EXIT\" sign FLASHES UNNATURALLY -- the door automatically UNLOCKS -- they push through -- Morgan runs up, too late; the door's shut again.

PENTAGON - MAINTENANCE AREA - DAY DEAFENING NOISE: blow torches, steam pipes, radios, and a huge CRUSHING SOUND coming from an INDUSTRIAL TRASH COMPACTOR as Pentagon detritus gets recycled. Latesha and Scott hurry in -- MOVING through quickly -- scanning -- when they SEE it: a forklift whirring towards the. compactor carrying a huge bin filled with old fire extinguishers. Hundreds of them, stem valves removed, ready to be.dumped. Scott and Latesha break into a RUN, skittering down stairs to the main floor. Running towards the forklift, waving wildly: LATESHA SCOTT Stop!! STOP! STOP!! But the forklift Operator can't hear them with the bright orange EARPLUGS in his ears. Speeds the forklift to the mouth of the compactor and dumps the extinguishers inside just as Scott and Latesha catch up and see the HUGE CRUSHING ARM of the compactor rumbling down to flatten everything'- The compactor Operator looks over as Scott and Latesha wave their IDS furiously and he punches a button to STOP the arm just three feet shy of crushing everything. LATESHA We have to look in there! Latesha starts climbing INTO the compactor COMPACTOR OPERATOR Lady, you can't do that! LATESHA The hell I can't! Come on! Shit. Scott has no choice but to follow her and climbs in, ducking low, the ARM frozen just feet above them. The compactor's foul, inches of industrial grease and crap and God- knows-what. They start wading through the extinguishers, turning them over, shaking them, looking inside-- SCOTT Shit, there're hundreds of them... LATESHA keep looking, it's here... 3/28/07 87 CONTINUED: WHEN THE ARM. Moves. Just a fraction. The operator looks at the console: the hell? Latesha and Scott keep ploughing through the tanks as...

Grabs Latesha by the jacket and tumbles out of the COMPACTOR but not before Latesha sees something on an extinguisher and reaches back-- SCOTT Latesha! -- grabbing the extinguisher as CRASH!! The ARM CRUSHES down as she snaps her hand back just in time. Turns the tank over and palms something, unnoticed by everyone. As the operator runs up to her, beside himself -- OPERATOR I don't know what happened! It wouldn't stop! Latesha catches her breath, livid,a chill ripping through her. SCOTT -- you okay? Jesus (but her eyes are LOCKED on the Cameras) Latesha? LATESHA yeah. I need to get out of here. SCOTT Yes. Yes. Good idea. Come on -- As they start walking out. Workers parting to let them through. As they head towards the exit, Latesha suddenly pulls Scott into THE-- BATHROOM: slams the door and locks it. LATESHA Your girlfriend can't see us in here -- Gimme your phone -- SCOTT What --?! My phone? What're you -- When Latesha opens her hand and Scott sees a CELL SIM CARD: LATESHA He hid it under the valve. This is what Paul Shaw left for us -- 3/28/07 88.
