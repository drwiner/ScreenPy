I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They\n\nlive on the Moons of Iego I thimk. They are the most beautiful creatures in\n\nthe universe.

Everyone looks at him. He turns a\n\nlittle brighter red.\n\nSHMI : All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.\n\nANAKIN : I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no\n\nluck.\n\nSHMI : Any attempt to escape...\n\nANAKIN : ...and they blow you up...poof!\n\nPADME and JAR JAR are horrified.\n\nJAR JAR : How wude.\n\nPADME : I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The\n\nRepublic's anti-slavery laws...\n\nSHMI : The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.\n\nAn awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment.\n\nANAKIN : Have you ever seen a Podrace?\n\nPADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR JAR snatches\n\nsome food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue.\n\nQUI-GON gives him a dirty look.\n\nQUI-GON : They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.\n\nANAKIN : I'm the only human who can do it.\n\nSHMI looks askance at her son.\n\nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's\n\nnever heard of a human doing it.\n\nQUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.\n\nANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl\n\nwith his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and\n\nforefinger. JAR JAR is startled.\n\nQUI-GON : (Cont'd) Don't do that again.\n\nJAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of\n\nthe tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth.\n\nANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something...\n\nQUI-GON : What?\n\nANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?\n\nQUI-GON : What makes you think that?\n\nANAKIN : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.\n\nQUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.\n\nQUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.\n\nANAKIN : I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.\n\nQUI-GON : I wish that were so...\n\nANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the\n\nslaves...have you come to free us?\n\nQUI-GON : No, I'm afraid not...\n\nANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here?\n\nQUI-GON thinks for a moment.\n\nQUI-GON : I can see there's no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn't\n\nlet anyone know about us...we're on our way to Coruscant, the central\n\nsystem in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept\n\nsecret.\n\nANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?\n\nPADME : Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair\n\nit.\n\nANAKIN : I can help! I can fix anything!\n\nQUI-GON : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we\n\nneed...\n\nJAR JAR : Wit no-nutten mula to trade.\n\nPADME : These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.\n\nSHMI : Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful\n\nraces.\n\nQUI-GON : Podracing... Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it's used\n\nproperly.\n\nANAKIN : I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race\n\ntomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...\n\nSHMI : Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you...\n\nANAKIN : Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him\n\nthink it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.\n\nQUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.\n\nSHMI : I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful. I die every time Watto\n\nmakes you do it.\n\nANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The\n\nprize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina\n\npitty bad goo.\n\nGUI-GON : Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who\n\nmight be able to help us?\n\nSHMI shakes her head no.\n\nANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in\n\nthe universe is no one helps each other...\n\nSHMI : Anakin, don't...\n\nJAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat.\n\nPADME : I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will\n\nfind another way...\n\nSHMI : No, Annie's right, there is no other way... I may not like it, but\n\nhe can help you...he was meant to help you.\n\nANAKIN : Is that a yes? That is a yes!\n\nThe storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel.",

DARTH MAUL\n\ntakes off his cape, and ignites his laser sword. Both ends of the sword\n\nlight up.\n\nAt the far end of the hanger, SIX WHEEL DROIDS roll in and transform into\n\ntheir battle position. ARTOO calls ANAKIN's attention to the DROIDS.

Suddenly, the ship's systems go on, and the ship\n\nbegins to levitate.\n\nANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right, thanks Artoo! Great idea! I'll take over.\n\nLet's see...\n\nANAKIN steers the ship toward the DROIDS. He pushes a button, and the ship\n\nbegins to shake.\n\nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Where's the trigger? Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one....\n\nANAKIN pushes a second button, and the lasers begin to fire, wiping out\n\nseveral DESTROYER DROIDS. ARTOO whistles a cheer.\n\nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Yeah, all right. \"Droid blaster.\" Yeah!\n\nThe JEDI are engaged in a fierce sword fight with DARTH MAUL. They have\n\nmoved into the center of the hanger. While the WHEEL DROIDS are momentarily\n\ndistracted by ANAKIN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS exit into a\n\npalace hallway.\n\nThe WHEEL DROIDS start firing at ANAKIN. There are EXPLOSIONS all around\n\nhim.\n\nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops...shield up! Always on the right...shields always on\n\nthe right.\n\nANAKIN flips several switches, and the after-burner ignites.\n\nANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're moving. I'll shut the energy drive down.\n\nThe fighter rockets out of the hanger. ARTOO and ANAKIN hold on for dear\n\nlife.\n\nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops!!
