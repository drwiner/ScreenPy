The woman's face begins to\n\n\ttwitch, as though she is having a bad dream. She moans slightly\n\n\tand her expression grows more desperate.\n\n\tA mix of subtle sounds begin to fade in. As they get louder, we\n\n\tcan discern what sounds like a busy office area. It is actually\n\n\ta frantic television studio with the hum of panic in a national\n\n\temergency.\n\n\tThe woman's moans get louder and more desperate as the\n\n\tbackground sounds reach full volume and the credits stop. The\n\n\twoman sits up, snapping awake.\n\n2\tShe lurches forwards into the arms of a strong young man. She is\n\n\tFrancine, twenty three years old and very attractive, although\n\n\tshe is gritty with dirt. Her hair is hanging, dishevelled and\n\n\tsweaty. Her jeans and blouse have been worn for several days.\n\n\tShe is sitting on the floor, where she has slept the last\n\n\tseveral hours, covered by an old overcoat.\n\n\tTony:\tYOU OK?\n\n\tFran stares at the young man. She is shaking. She doesn't speak.\n\n\tTony:\tTHE SHIT'S REALLY HITTING THE FAN.\n\n\tThe girl tries to clear her head as the young man moves on to\n\n\twhere others sleep on the floor. He wakes them up one at a time.\n\n\tWe begin to hear voices over the busy hum of the studio. They\n\n\thave an electronic tinniness, as broadcast over a monitor. Fran\n\n\tlooks about. She is still shaken from her dream.\n\n3\tWe see the television studio. Reporters buzz about madly.\n\n\tEverybody looks dishevelled and exhausted. Technicians man\n\n\tmonitors, and we see people on the little screens, arguing\n\n\temotionally.\n\n4\tVoice:\tWHAT'S MAKING IT HAPPEN? WHAT THE HELL",

He is trapped at the side of the machine. He doesn't\n\n\thave his rifle. He fumbles with the snap on his hand-gun\n\n\tholster.\n\n\tSuddenly, the blank face of the Zombie turns red as the top of\n\n\tits head seems to disintegrate into a bloody pulp. The creature\n\n\thas walked into the spinning chopper blade. Its body staggers\n\n\tforward another step or two, then the thing collapses in a heap.\n\n134\tStephen and Fran have reached the chopper. Steve let's go of the\n\n\twoman's hand and he drops his bloody sledge to the ground. He\n\n\tlunges into the cockpit and snatches up his rifle, ducking in\n\n\tthe propeller draft.\n\n135\tThe Zombie which is stumbling up the grade from the hangars\n\n\talmost loses its footing, but it regains its balance and\n\n\tadvances steadily toward the helicopter.",

It is a huge,\n\n\tsuburban shopping mall. The outer walls are all concrete, and\n\n\ttheir clean lines stretch upward for more than two storeys. The\n\n\tbuilding looks like a giant domino lying flat on the ground.\n\n\tThere are only four entrances, and the shops which are housed\n\n\twithin have no windows opening onto the surrounding lot.\n\n158\tIn the immense area around the building, lanes and stalls are\n\n\tpainted for automobile parking. What few cars now dot the area\n\n\tare parked randomly, some with their doors open wide.\n\n159\tWe hear the sound of the helicopter engine fading in, then we\n\n\tsee the little machine as it approaches and eases down onto the\n\n\troof of the building.\n\n160\tIn the parking lot, walking among the abandoned vehicles, we see\n\n\tseveral of the living dead.  They look almost like normal\n\n\tshoppers at the mall for morning chores, but their lumbering\twalk is unmistakably stiff.\n\n161\tAt one of the mall entrances, we see a revolving door flanked\n\n\tby several regularly hinged doors, all made of glass and\n\n\tsurrounded by large windows. A few of the Zombies manage to\tnegotiate the hinged doors and enter the building. Others bounce\n\n\toff windows and claw the transparent glass in confusion. One\n\n\tcreature walks around in the revolving door endlessly.\n\n\tThere are a good many of the creatures, but they are spread out\n\n\tand far between. They move with no seeming purpose.\n\n\tWe do not yet see the mall interior.  The Zombies pay no\tattention to the sound of the chopper engine stopping overhead.\n\n162\tOn the roof, even as the blades of the helicopter still spin,\n\n\tthe humans are out and moving to the edge of the building. They\n\n\tlook down at the creatures which dot the parking lot.\n\n\tFran:\tOH MY GOD!\n\n\tStephen:\tNO CHANCE.

He\n\n\tstares through one of them and can see into the mall below.\n\n\tRoger trots up and peers through another of the bubbles.\n\n\tPeter:\tMOST OF THE GATES ARE DOWN. I DON'T THINK\t\t\tTHEY CAN GET INTO THE STORES.164\tThe vantage point only reveals a small aspect of the interior,\n\n\ta square plaza with a garden beneath the sunroof of transparent\n\n\tbubbles. The space is open all the way down to the garden, which\n\n\tis two storeys below. Around the garden on the bottom floor can\n\n\tbe seen the entrances to several shops. All but one have heavy\n\n\tmetal cage gates down and locked into position.\n\n\tOne or two Zombies are seen wandering about. They cannot enter\n\n\tthe stores, except for the one which is un-gated.\n\n\tHalfway up the walls can be seen a balcony railing which rings\n\n\tthe entire plaza, it is a second storey of shops. The same cage-\n\n\tgates seal off the visible store entrances, but none of the dead\n\n\tcreatures are evident on the balcony.\n\n165\tFran and Stephen come trotting up to the bubbles.\n\n\tRoger:\tI HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM UP ON THE SECOND",

Then the big man brings his rifle\n\n\tbutt down against the glass and the shattered pane crashes to\n\n\tthe floor below.\n\n177\tInside - the vast space is impressive. It is quite dark but for\n\n\trays of sunlight which drift through the occasional skylights.\n\n\tWe see an enormous quantity of food cartons and water drums, it\n\n\tis very quiet. The space is barren except for the stacks of\n\n\tCivil Defence supplies.\n\n178\tSuddenly, a figure drops out of one of the skylights, landing on\n\n\tits feet in the sunray. It is Peter.\tInstantly he readies his rifle, looking this way and that across\n\n\tthe large room. Silence.\n\n\tPeter:\tOK.\n\n\tHe steps aside and Roger climbs in. He too drops cat-like to the\n\n\tfloor.179\tThe two men instantly sling their rifles and move to the food\n\n\tcartons as by pre-arranged plan. They carry the big boxes\n\n\tquickly, one at a time, to the spot under the open skylight.\tIn a moment, they have built a pyramid out of the cartons. It\n\n\tcreates a kind of stairway for a quick escape through the window\n\n\tabove.\n\n180\tNow Fran lowers herself into the room and is able to climb down\n\n\tthe cartons holding onto Roger's hand. She is followed by an\n\n\tanxious Stephen.181\tPeter has already wandered off. There are only two doors in the\n\n\tenormous room, one at either end. The big Trooper moves up to\n\n\tone of them as Roger comes up behind him, gun ready.\tPeter's hand turns the doorknob. It is unlocked, and the big man\n\n\tgives Roger a familiar nod. Roger stands several feet back, his\n\n\trifle aimed directly at the door and ready to fire. Then, with a\n\n\tsudden, commando-like motion. Peter throws the door open and\n\n\tducks away flat against the wall. Roger stiffens, his finger all\n\n\tbut pulling his trigger, but there is no apparent danger.\n\n182\tThe door opens onto another vast room, equivalent to the one the\n\n\tpeople are in. It also has stacks of C.D. supplies.\n\n\tThe Troopers cautiously move into the area through the door. The\n\n\troom is empty. The same sunrays pierce the darkness through\n\n\tskylights. All is dead quiet. This room has no doors at all, but\n\n\tfor the one Peter opened.\n\n\tRoger:\tDOUBLE DAMN! LOOKS LIKE A FREE LUNCH, BUDDY.183\tIn the first room Stephen has started to rip open one of the\n\n\tcartons.\n\n\tFran:\tSPAM!\n\n\tRoger walks back into the room.\n\n\tRoger:\tYOU BRING A CAN OPENER?\n\n\tFran:\tOH.\n\n\tRoger:\tTHEN DON'T KNOCK SPAM. IT'S GOT IT'S OWN KEY.\n\n\tThe woman flips over the can in her hand and finds the little\n\n\tkey.\n\n\tPeter has walked right past the group.  He is moving quickly\n\n\ttoward the still-unknown door at the other end of the room.\n\n\tAgain, Roger follows.\n\n184\tAt the door, the two Troopers go through the same S.W.A.T.\n\n\tprocedure. The door swings open, this time onto a very small\n\n\tspace. Again no immediate danger.\n\n185\tAs the men enter, they discover that they are on the top landing\n\n\tof a concrete and metal firestair. There are no windows, and the\n\n\tair is musty. There is one bare light bulb lit in the ceiling,\n\n\tbut down the stairs at the next landing it is quite dark, and\n\n\tthere the stairs wind even further down; they recede into\n\n\tblackness.\n\n\tRoger:\tWHATD'YA THINK?\n\n\tThe Black man just stares, first down into the darkness then\n\n\tback into the storage area.\n\n\tRoger:\tTHIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP HERE.

Directly across from them are two open\n\n\tsupply rooms, one containing a stationery sink and a toilet.\n\n\tBoth rooms are filled with cleaning supplies.193\tDown along the hall can be seen a dozen or so doorways. Some\n\n\tdoors are open, some are closed. Along the opposite wall there\n\n\tis nothing.\tThe far end of the hall, about a hundred yards away, opens out\n\n\tonto the second story of the mall proper.194\tThe men look at one another and slowly move down the corridor.\n\n\tThey try the first two doors, which are locked. The third is\n\n\twide open.\n\n195\tRoger ducks quickly into the room with his rifle raised. It is\n\n\ta large administrative office, with rows of desks which are\n\n\tfully equipped for a staff of secretaries and accountants.196\tThe next room has a closed door, but it is unlocked. Peter\tswings the door open and silently jumps into the room. This is\n\n\ta much more spartan area, with two metal desks and a few chairs.\n\n\tThere are several phones. It is a maintenance office. On one\n\n\twall is a large map of the mall, with pin flags and scribbling\n\n\tover an acetate which covers the drawing. At the other end of\n\n\tthe space is a huge electrical panel with circuit breakers and\n\n\tan entire series of master controls all keyed by a number code\n\n\tto another map of the mall showing electrical installations.\tOn the wall behind Peter is a large blackboard and two metal\n\n\tcabinets. One is open. It contains all sorts of tools, manual\n\n\tand electric. There are circuit testers, walkie talkie units and\n\n\tthere are several enormous rings containing hundreds of keys,\n\n\talso colour and number coded. Peter grabs up one of the rings\n\n\tand Roger steps up behind him.\tRoger:\tTHE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.197\tBack in the hallway, Roger's hand tries another doorknob and\tthrows the door open. This opens onto beautifully plush offices,\n\n\tobviously the executive headquarters.\tThe rooms interconnect, and while Peter walks from door to door\n\n\tin the corridor, Roger moves through the inner doors, meeting\n\n\tPeter at each room. One office is more elegant than the next,\n\n\twith the latest in designer furniture and expensive decorations.198\tThe Troopers finally reach a room on which both the interior and\n\n\tcorridor doors are closed and locked. The brass nameplate on the\n\n\tinterior door reads C.J. Porter - President.199\tRoger moves out to the corridor where he joins Peter. They move\n\n\tinto the exterior corridor. They are very near the end of the\n\n\thall, and the brightly lit shopping area is close at hand. They\n\n\tcan only see a small section.200\tThe balcony on their side is railed off against the open drop\n\n\tdown to the first floor, and across the great cavity they see\n\n\tthe opposite balcony. On the far side only two store fronts can\n\n\tbe seen. They are both gated and shut.\n\n201\tThe two realise what dangers might face them in the mall proper.\n\n\tThey look at each other and move forward, each clinging to\n\n\topposite walls in the corridor.202\tAs they reach the mall proper they slowly and carefully peer\n\n\taround their respective corners.\n\n203\tThe upper balcony totally surrounds the vast interior of the\n\n\tbuilding, and at several points bridges across from one side to\n\n\tthe other. Little shops of all types run along the entire length\n\n\tof the balcony, and at each far end, stands the entrance arches\n\n\tfor a large department store.\tMost of the stores are gated, but several seem open. The big\n\n\tdepartment stores are gated and locked. Here and there tall\n\n\ttrees grow up from the ground floor and reach up into view of\n\n\tthe second storey. There are none of the living dead evident on\n\n\tthe balcony.204\tThe two troopers move slowly and quietly to the railing. The\n\n\tcrouch and peer down through the bars of the rail. Below, the\n\n\tsight is even more spectacular.205\tStores of every type offer gaudy displays of consumer items.\tEverything from clothing to appliances. Photo equipment; audio\n\n\tand video outlets; sporting goods and weaponry; gourmet foods\n\n\tand natural organic foods. There is a Book Store, a Record\n\n\tStore, a Real Estate Agency and a Bank; A Novelty Shop, a Gift\n\n\tShop; all with the absolute latest in American consumer items.\n\n\tAnd at either end of the concourse like the main Altars at each\n\n\tend of a Cathedral, stand the mammoth two storey Department\n\n\tStores; great symbols of a consumer society.\n\n\tDown the centre of the ground floor, along with the gardens and\n\n\tpark benches, are little stalls.

The men drag it to a point just at the\n\n\tside of the open arch, and Peter instantly jumps up on the top\n\n\tof it. At that instant, a Zombie rounds the corner and grabs at\n\n\tPeter's legs. The big man kicks, startled, and the motion causes\n\n\thim to fall off the little counter. He lands on his feet, but\n\n\tout on the balcony beyond the arch. Roger brings his rifle butt\n\n\taround against the creature's head and the Zombie falls back,\n\n\tbut is not dead.\n\n\tOther creatures are only a few feet from Peter, whose gun sits\n\n\ton the little counter inside the store. Roger levels off his\n\n\trifle but cannot fire as Peter is in the line. Peter makes a\n\n\tmove and, like a football player, jukes to the left, then to the\n\n\tright. He dives right at one of the creatures carrying it into\n\n\tthe store.\tNow Roger fires, dropping one, then another. Peter jumps back up\ton the counter.\tPeter:\tBEHIND YOU...BEHIND YOU...\n\n\tThe creature in the store has crashed against a cosmetics\n\n\tdisplay and is regaining its footing. Roger turns and fires. The\tcreature falls. Peter grabs the lip of the roll gate and starts\n\n\tto bring it down.\n\n\tThere are several creatures right in the archway, now they\n\n\tclutch with their hands. One blocks the downward progress of the\tgate. Roger fires point blank and the Zombie flies back. The\n\n\tgate lowers but is stopped by the clutching hands of other\n\n\tcreatures. Roger grabs the cage now and helps to pull it down.\n\n\tPeter, still gripping the lip, jumps off the counter to get more\n\n\tleverage.\tThe bottom of the gate is now four feet from the floor. The two\n\n\tmen are able to move it steadily downward. The Zombies are very\n\n\tweak, but more creatures appear making it more difficult. Then\n\n\tone Zombie tries to crawl under the gate. Its torso just gets\n\n\tthrough as the gate slams down against its chest. Its arms grab\n\n\tfor Peter's legs and its mouth is gasping. Its body is\n\n\tpreventing the gate from engaging in the floor mechanisms.\tRoger lets go the cage as Peter tries to hold it against the\n\n\tcreatures outside. Grabbing his rifle, Roger brings the butt\n\n\tstraight down on the clutching Zombie's skull. The Zombie goes\n\n\tlimp. Then Roger tries to push the creature clear of the gate,\n\n\tbut the pressure is too great.\n\n\tRoger:\tLET UP A LITTLE...LET UP A LITTLE...\n\n\tThe gate rises a few inches. More Zombies appear outside. Their\n\n\thands clutch at the roll gate. The openings in the grid are only\n\n\tbig enough for their fingers, their hands can't reach through,\n\n\tbut they are pushing the gate higher and higher...more than\n\n\tPeter intended to clear the obstructing corpse.\tWith his rifle butt, Roger manages to push the dead Zombie clear\n\n\texcept for one of its arms. From outside, a creature's hand\n\n\tsuddenly grabs Roger's weapon. For a moment its like a Tug-O-War.\n\n\tPeter is having a harder time holding the gate. It is inching\n\n\tupward.\tPeter:\tCOME ON...COME ON...\tRoger lets go his gun barrel and the weapon is snatched away by\n\n\tthe creature in the crowd. Roger grabs for the gate.\tPeter:\tTHE ARM...THAT ARM'S IN THE WAY.\tRoger squats again and manages to throw the dead Zombie's arm\tclear. Then he grabs the gate again. Now it starts to move down\n\n\tmore steadily.\tAt the last moment, another clutching arm juts into the store,\n\n\tbut when the gate hits it, it withdraws, and the big cage clicks\n\n\tsolidly into place.\n\n\tThe two Troopers step back from the gate. The creatures still\n\n\tmoan and gurgle, slamming against the gate, their fingers\n\n\tclutching at the grid, but they are unable to budge it.\n\n\tThere are ten or twelve Zombies trying to get into the\n\n\tDepartment Store and several others are making their way along\n\n\tthe balcony. At least six lie dead along the floor.\tRoger:\tWELL...WE'RE IN...NOW, HOW THE HELL WE GONNA\t\t\tGET BACK?\tPeter:\tLET'S GO SHOPPIN' FIRST.\n\n\tThe two men back into the aisles of the store. The creatures\n\n\toutside still push and claw at the gate. The one with Roger's\n\n\trifle uses it as a bludgeon, but it has no effect.\n\n249\tStephen opens the door into the Administration corridor.\n\n250\tFrom his perspective, the hall is inactive. He observes the\n\n\twashrooms and the long row of doors to the various offices.\n\n251\tHe starts into the corridor, letting the firestair door close.\n\n252\tAt the top of the firestair, Fran can see the beam of light from\n\n\tthe open door below. As the door closes, the beam narrows, then\n\n\tit blinks out with a click as the door closes.\tFran:\tSTEPHEN...JESUS GOD...\n\n\tShe is very frightened.  She backs into the storage area.253\tShe moves quickly to the pyramid of cartons which lead to the\troof. She sits on the bottom carton biting her fingers.254\tIn the Department Store, Roger is riding down an escalator. He\n\n\thas found a back pack, and it is obviously already filled with\n\n\tgoods. As he steps off the moving stairs on the ground floor,\n\n\tthe surroundings are eerily quiet.255\tHe moves through a clothing department. We see the dead looking\n\n\tfaces of store mannequins. Roger runs into one and is greatly\n\n\tstartled. He snatches up a lined windbreaker and ties it around\n\n\this waist by its arms, then he trots off down another aisle,\n\n\twhere he finds Peter.\n\n256\tThe big Trooper has a radio under his arm and he is snatching up\n\n\ta small television.\n\n\tRoger:\tHEY MAN, WE CAN'T CARRY ALL THIS SHIT...\n\n257\tPeter turns a corner and dumps the articles into something\n\n\twhich we cannot yet see. As Roger trots up, he sees that Peter\n\n\thas a big gardening cart already heaped with goods.\n\n\tRoger:\tOH...WE'RE GONNA JUST WHEEL RIGHT BY 'EM, RIGHT?\tPeter:\tWE GONNA TRY, BROTHER. WE AIN'T DOIN' THIS",

Electrical cables, flashlights, batteries. They scoop\n\n\tthings up like contestants on a game-show who have five minutes\n\n\tin a store to grab whatever they can.259\tStephen is in the Maintenance office. He examines the maps and\telectrical equipment, then rummages through a desk.260\tAt the open end of the corridor leading to the second storey\n\n\tbalcony, Zombies wander past as they head for the Store entrance\n\n\twhere many creature still claw at the roll gate.261\tThe Zombies move randomly. Some are leaving the gate as their\tprey is now out of sight. They begin to wander here and there.\n\n262\tThree of the creatures turn into the administrative corridor and\n\n\tstart toward the offices.\n\n263\tStephen has found a large binder in the desk. It contains all\n\n\tthe plans for the mall, duplicating the charts on the walls and\n\n\tmany others. It is a complete maintenance manual revealing all\n\n\tthe workings and layout of the huge structure.264\tElevator doors slide open with a loud whoosh. The two Troopers\n\n\tappear in the car, wheeling their barrow out onto the second\n\n\tstorey aisles of the big store.265\tNow, they can see the roll gate and the creatures pushing at it\n\n\tineffectively. They roll their barrow very close to the gate.\n\n\tWhen the Zombies catch sight of the humans, their efforts are\n\n\trenewed. They moan and push harder at the gate.266\tThey Troopers leave the barrow, disappearing back to the aisles.\tThey run onto the interior escalator, bounding down faster than\n\n\tthe moving steps, then they run across the first floor until\n\n\tthey see the lower level-roll gate.267\tThere are creatures wandering the concourse, but none of them\tare at the gate.\tPeter:\tLET'S GO BROTHER...THE OLD OKEY DOKE!\n\n\tThe men move up to the roll gate. A Zombie lumbers past. Roger\n\n\tspeaks to the creature.\n\n\tRoger:\tHEY, UGLY!\n\n\tThe creature turns instantly. Registers. Then dives for the\n\n\tgate with a moaning roar. Its mouth opens and its hands clutch.\n\n\tThe gate pops forward from the creature's thrust, but it holds\n\n\ttightly. The action causes Roger to jump even though there is no\n\n\timmediate danger.\tPeter:\tLET'S RAISE SOME HELL...HEY...HEY...\n\n\t\t\t(he is shouting)\n\n\tRoger:\tOVER HERE...LET'S GO OVER HERE...\n\n268\tOther creatures along the concourse turn toward the Department\n\n\tStore. They lumber along attracted by the sounds.\n\n269\tAt the gate, several Zombies push at the metal grids. The\n\n\tTroopers back away, but stay in sight of the creatures.\n\n\tPeter:\tJUST GIVE IT TIME ...GIVE IT TIME.\n\n270\tUpstairs, the Zombies at the upper gate are attracted by the\n\n\tcommotion below. They begin to move away from the gate and\n\n\tlumber along the balcony to the stairways and escalators.\n\n271\tIn the maintenance office, Stephen still rummages. He finds a\n\n\tloaded hand gun and stuffs it in his belt. He moves to the large\n\n\tcabinets containing the walkie talkies and the keys.272\tIn the corridor, the stray Zombies move in and out of the\n\n\texecutive offices as they draw nearer to the Maintenance room.273\tSeveral creatures fall over one another as they try to move down\n\n\tthe up escalator. The down escalator push others onto the first\n\n\tfloor. They scramble to their feet and move toward the\n\n\tDepartment Store.\n\n274\tIn the concourse, many creatures are moving toward the gate.\n\n\tAlready there are a dozen or so clutching and pushing at the\n\n\tmetal grid. Through the crowd. Peter can see several other\n\n\tcreatures lumbering down the stationary steps.\n\n275\tPeter:\tOK...THEY 'RE COMIN'...\n\n\tThe big man readies his walkie talkie, pulling the antenna out.\tPeter:\tGO ON UP...STAY OUTTA SIGHT BUT LEMME KNOW\t\t\tWHEN ITS CLEAR ENOUGH.\tRoger, clutching his walkie talkie, disappears among the aisles\n\n\tas he runs, crouching, into the store.

She throws herself against it, but can't plant her\n\n\tfeet well because of the carton of the floor. The door moves an\n\n\tinch at a time. The creature's hand reaches into the room. It\n\n\tclutches at the edge of the door.\n\n354\tFran panics and runs back towards the escape pyramid, where she\n\n\tturns and faces the door.\n\n355\tThe creature is straining against the weight of the carton. Now,\n\n\tnow both its hands clutch the door edge. The carton moves\n\n\tanother inch...and another. Now, the creature's head can be seen\n\n\tas it strains to get through the widening space.\n\n356\tFran's eyes are wide, almost hypnotised. She looks for something\n\n\tto use as a weapon. The room is bare but for the cartons and\n\n\twater drums. She is about to opt for the skylight, when she\n\n\tglimpses Roger's knap-sack in the shadows. She runs for it as\n\n\tthe creature finally breaks into the big room.\n\n357\tThe woman's hands tremble as she rummages through the cloth\n\n\tsack. Nothing appropriate. She dumps the contents out:\n\n\tammunition, mace cans, batteries, flares...flares! She\n\n\tnervously grabs one of the cylinders and her shaking hands try\n\n\tto deal with the paper wrapping.\n\n358\tThe Zombie moans as it draws closer. It is approaching the\n\n\tpyramid of cartons.\n\n359\tFran manages to free the wrapping, and snaps the cylinder in two\n\n\tat the mark.\n\n360\tNow the Zombie is between her and the pyramid, cutting off her\n\n\timmediate route. It is very near. Fran backs away a few steps as\n\n\tshe tries to strike the flare head on the small striker on the\n\n\tcylinder cap. It doesn't fire...she tries again...and again.\n\n\tNow, the Zombie has reached the knap-sack. It kicks through the\n\n\titems and knocks and rolls the other flares.\n\n\tFran's flare finally catches with a great whoosh, the bright\n\n\tflame startling the woman as well as the Zombie. The creature's\n\n\teyes go wide and it brings its arms up to avoid the brightness.\n\n\tThe intense white flame casts an eerie light over the creature\n\n\tand throws the Zombie's enormous shadow against the cartons and\n\n\twall. The creature backs away a few steps almost tripping over\n\n\tthe articles on the floor.\n\n\tFran manages to advance close enough to snatch two extra\n\n\tcylinders and skirt around the Zombie in a wide arc. The\n\n\tcreature swats the air, keeping distance, but threatening.\n\n\tFran considers the firestair door, but decides on the pyramid.\n\n\tShe circles around to a point where she can climb up from\n\n\tbehind the moaning Zombie. She rushes for the cartons and\n\n\tclimbs, but loses her footing while trying to hold the flares\n\n\tand crashes into the topmost carton. It starts to slide off\n\n\tthe pyramid and tumbles to the floor almost crashing into the\n\n\tZombie. The creature starts to clutch at the pyramid.\n\n\tThe stack of cartons is now too short and Fran can reach the\n\n\tskylight but can't pull herself up. She accidentally drops\n\n\ttwo flares, including the lit one. It tumbles to the floor\n\n\tbehind the pyramid where it no longer offends the Zombie's\n\n\teye's. Now the creature tries to climb to the woman.\n\n\tFran grabs the last flare in her mouth and reaches with both\n\n\thands for the skylight. She lifts with all her might and her\n\n\tfeet come off the cartons but she cannot pull herself up. As she\n\n\ttries to lower her feet back to the cartons, the pyramid shakes\n\n\tand wobbles from the Zombie. The creature is making progress;\n\n\tits hands can almost touch Fran's foot.\n\n361\tPeter drops out of a ceiling grid into a plush office. Roger's\n\n\tlegs appear through the grid and he too swings down, holding on\n\n\twith his hands to soften his landing.\n\n\tSuddenly, we are aware of a third person on the room in the\n\n\tlarge chair at the desk.

They pull\n\n\tacross the little loading lot and out a ramp toward the\n\n\troadway. Stephen hovers overhead in the chopper, following\n\n\tthe trucks as closely as he can.\n\n403\tOn the roof of the mall, Fran clutches her rifle. She sees the\n\n\tbig trucks roar up over the hill, the helicopter just above\n\n\tthem. It is a strange looking convoy as it speeds toward the\n\n\ttrucks as closely as it can.\n\n404\tAlong the road, several Zombies try to stagger after the trucks\n\n\tbut they are left in the dust of the speeding vehicles. The\n\n\tcreatures lumber along slowly behind.\n\n405\tThe vehicles pull into the little grade which loads into the\n\n\tmall's parking lot. They roar right toward the building.\n\n406\tAt one of the building entrances, a cluster of Zombies is\n\n\tmoving in and lot of the main doors. Others wander nearby in the\n\n\tparking lot. Attracted by the sounds of the engines, the\n\n\tcreatures turn and face the trucks.\n\n\tAs Peter pulls his vehicle in a wide arc, Roger drives his right\n\n\tup to the side of the building and roars toward the entrance\n\n\tdoors. Then he skips his right wheels up onto the curb, and with\n\n\ta great, scraping crunch, the big truck pulls directly abreast\n\n\tof the building, flush with the entrance. The huge vehicle\n\n\tcrushes several of the helpless creatures and knocks other\n\n\tflying back.\n\n407\tThe trailer of the truck has totally blocked off the mall\n\n\tentrance. Several Zombies trapped inside try to push the glass\n\n\tdoors open. The doors move, but cannot be opened wide enough\n\n\tfor the creatures to get out.\n\n408\tThe few creatures immediately around the truck begin clambering\n\n\tat its sides. Roger shuts off the engine and grabs his gun as\n\n\tother Zombies begin clutching at the windows of the cab.\n\n409\tOverhead, the whirlybird hovers very close by. Now Peter's big\n\n\ttruck pulls up alongside so that Peter's passenger door is\n\n\tdirectly abreast of the free door on Roger's cab.\n\n\tPeter's truck also crushes one or two of the creatures, but\n\n\tthere are still several in the immediate vicinity of the cab.\n\n410\tAs Roger opens his door and scrambles into the other truck, one\n\n\tof the Zombies grabs hold. Roger just manages to kick the\n\n\tcreature off as the big truck pulls out and roars across the\n\n\tlot.\n\n411\tThe helicopter flies straight up and directly over the roof of\n\n\tthe big shopping centre, where Fran has been watching the\n\n\taction. She now runs to the other side of the roof, the wind\n\n\tfrom the chopper whipping her hair.\n\n412\tThe chopper turns and waits for the big truck to move up under\n\n\tit, then the whirlybird escorts the trailer back to the warehouse\n\n\tdown the road.\n\n413\tRoger is whooping and hollering like a cowboy as the big rig\n\n\tpulls up beside another of the parked vans.\n\n\tPeter:\tCOME ON, COME ON... THREE MORE BABY.\n\n\tRoger:\tLIKE A CHARM, HUH? LIKE A FUCKING CHARM!\n\n\tRoger grabs his knapsack and climbs into the new cab where he\n\n\timmediately goes to work on jumping the engine cables.\n\n414\tFrom the helicopter overhead, Stephen spots something moving\n\n\taround the warehouse. He jockeys the chopper slightly for a\n\n\tbetter look and he sees a small group of Zombies wandering out\n\n\tof the big garage directly toward Roger's truck.\n\n415\tIn the meantime, Peter's truck pulls away from the cab Roger is\n\n\tin. The big vehicle rolls into the large paved area behind the\n\n\twarehouse where Peter can turn it around easily.\n\n416\tStephen swoops down with the big bird. He buzzes as close as he\n\n\tcan to Roger's truck, trying to signal the man.\n\n417\tRoger continues to work on the cables, still whooping like a\n\n\tchild. The Zombies are very close at hand. They have just\n\n\tabout reached the cab. Stephen buzzes again. Roger doesn't\n\n\tnotice.\n\n418\tPeter has now backed up into a position which enables him to\n\n\tpull out. He looks up to see the helicopter heading straight\n\n\tfor him.\n\n419\tThe big chopper buzzes right over Peter's cab then spins around\n\n\theading back for Roger.\n\n420\tPeter looks toward the other truck. He can now see the lumbering\n\n\tcreatures.

Before she fires,\n\n\tPeter's rig slides next to Roger's, cabs abreast.\n\n450\tPeter's truck knocks over several of the clutching creatures.\n\n\tOne Zombie, caught directly under the front wheels, is still\n\n\talive and clutching at the air. Several creatures jump at\n\n\tPeter's driver side window.\n\n451\tRoger, grabbing his gun, moves to leave his truck on Peter's\n\n\tside, but the trucks are too close. His door won't open\n\n\tenough to get out. He rolls down his window. Peter has noticed\n\n\tRoger's door won't open, and the Trooper fumbles with the gear\n\n\tshift in order to pull away, but he hears Roger shouting:\n\n\tRoger:\tTHE WINDOWS...OPEN YOUR WINDOW...YOUR WINDOW...\n\n\tPeter dives across the cab and rolls down the passenger window.\n\n\tRoger leans out his open window, trying to get his weapon into\n\n\tfiring position. One or two Zombies are squeezing through the\n\n\tnarrow space between the truck. They are just about to reach\n\n\tRoger when he fires, killing the lead ghoul. More Zombies move\n\n\taround Roger's cab, moments away from him.\n\n452\tThe helicopter buzzes the area as Stephen watches the Zombies\n\n\tconverge on the cab.\n\n453\tFran, her hair blowing front he chopper, tries to aim her rifle\n\n\tinto the pack of creatures. Her hair covers her eyes and she\n\n\tbrushes it away with irritation.\n\n\tFran:\tROGER...IN FRONT, ROGER...IN FRONT, ROGER...\n\n\tShe shouts over the engine noises, getting very excited.\n\n454\tRoger fires again and again down the narrow space between the\n\n\trigs. Another Zombie falls.\n\n\tPeter:\tFOR CHRISSAKE COME ON!\n\n\tRoger is still emotionally crazed. He leans out of his window in\n\n\ta very vulnerable position. He is whooping like a child again as",

It disarms the\n\n\tZombie for a moment, Stephen thrashes his body back knocking\n\n\tthe think off balance. Then he quickly slides the keys under\n\n\tthe gate which he can lift just high enough with the single\n\n\tlock undone.\n\n\tAnother ghoul grabs Steve from behind. This time Steve's torch\n\n\tis knocked flying and rolls away. Fran is desperate. She tries\n\n\tto aim her pistol but cannot shoot through the grill. She holds\n\n\ther torch high.\n\n\tSteve kicks and scrambles, rolling on the floor. The Zombies\n\n\tare on him. He manages to knock one or two of them to the\n\n\tfloor. Then he fires with his pistol, killing another, He\n\n\tcrawls to the torch and grabs it, the creatures clutching and\n\n\ttugging at his pants and shirt.\n\n\tHe brings the flame up and flashes it at the Zombies. They back\n\n\taway enough for him to crawl to an open space. Then he scrambles\n\n\tto his feet and charges down the concourse toward the car.\n\n525\tAt the exhibit, Peter stops the cart. There are two of the\n\n\tlumbering creatures close at hand. The big trooper raises his\n\n\trifle. Roger, using all his strength, manages to pull himself up\n\n\tout of the cart. He lips to the exhibit as Peter fires at the\n\n\toncoming ghouls. The super-gun scores two perfect hits.\n\n526\tAs Roger tries to step onto the spinning platform, he falls and\n\n\trolls against the car. The turntable carries him around toward\n\n\tanother creature. He is struggling in pain toward the driver's\n\n\tdoor of the vehicle.\n\n527\tSteve, who is approaching at a run, sees the action.\n\n\tSteve:\tWATCH IS ROGER...ROGER!\n\n528\tRoger turns his head and sees the ghoul just before the creature\n\n\tgrabs him. The things hands clutch at the wrapped wound, which\n\n\tis already leaking blood through its dressing. Roger screams\n\n\tloudly.\n\n529\tPeter jumps up onto the spinning turntable, leans across the\n\n\thood of the car. His super-gun drills a hole through the\n\n\tcreature's skull. It falls off the exhibit.\n\n530\tPeter hurriedly comes around to Roger's side. In extreme pain,\n\n\tthe Trooper is desperately trying to open the driver door. Peter\n\n\thelps him. The door opens and Peter eases his friend into the\n\n\tseat. Roger immediately goes to work under the dash.\n\n531\tZombies are advancing now from all over the concourse.\n\n532\tPeter:\tGET IN!\n\n\tHe is shouting at Stephen who is just rushing up to the\n\n\tplatform. He and the Trooper scramble into opposite sides of the\n\n\tback seat. They slam the doors and make sure that all buttons\n\n\tare locked. Roger works as quickly as he can.\n\n533\tSeveral of the lead creatures reach the turntable. Some fall\n\n\ttrying to step onto the moving disc, but others manage to\n\n\tstruggle over to the car. They smash the windows with their\n\n\thands. It is a nightmarish scene as the men huddle in the\n\n\tshiny, new car which spins very slowly in circles.\n\n534\tFran has relocked the one open gate mechanism, and she stands\n\n\tnow trying to see the action, but it is out of her line of\n\n\tvision. She can only hear the moaning of the creatures, and\n\n\tpounding on the car. She turns the valve on her propane nozzle\n\n\textinguishing the flame.\n\n535\tThe car's engine roars as Roger is able to jump the wires.\n\n\tSteve:\tI'LL DRIVE IT...\n\n\tRoger:\tI GOT IT.\n\n\tThe Trooper's face contorts in agony as he moves himself into\n\n\tposition behind the wheel. He is shaking, but he bites his lip\n\n\tand slams the car into gear. There are at least eight creatures\n\n\tcrawling over the car, more approach. The platform spins. Roger\n\n\twaits until the car is aimed directly down the concourse. The\n\n\tmen in the back seats are alert to the Zombies which pound at\n\n\tthe windows. The ugly and distorted faces press close against\n\n\tthe safety glass.\n\n536\tNow the car pulls out quickly. It rolls of the edge of the\n\n\tspinning display, knocking several of the creatures aside. The\n\n\tfront wheels move off the platform and bounce onto the floor,\n\n\tbut the frame of the car scrapes the top of the disc and is\n\n\tstuck for a moment. The disc spins on carrying the rear of the\n\n\tcar with it. Then Roger gives it more gas. The rear wheels spin\n\n\tand finally catch.\n\n537\tThe car shoots out onto the mall floor. Some of the Zombies\n\n\tcling for a moment, but they fall away quickly, scrambling to\n\n\tregain their footing and follow.\n\n538\tThe car swerves and for an instant seems as though it will\n\n\tcrash against the columns on the concourse. Roger manages to\n\n\tcontrol it, and the shiny vehicle zooms ahead with tremendous\n\n\tenergy.\n\n539\tOne of the stray creatures in the concourse tries to intercept\n\n\tthe speeding auto, but the car knocks him mercilessly aside as\n\n\tthough he were a bowling pin.\n\n540\tFran sees the car as it rounds the corner, heads directly for\n\n\tthe main entrance which she can see from her position.\n\n541\tThe Zombies at the entrance already started back into the mall\n\n\tattracted by the commotion. The car zooms down the concourse\n\n\teasily breaking their ranks.\n\n542\tRoger throws the manoeuvrable vehicle into a screeching\n\n\ttailspin, stopping just at the doors.\n\n543\tThe big trailer blocks the entrance effectively. There are some\n\n\tcreatures inside the doors. Under the van, several Zombies are\n\n\tstruggling with the doors. one is just pushing in and seems as\n\n\tthough it will be able to enter.\n\n544\tPeter and Stephen slam against the door. Stephen aims his torch\n\n\tdirectly at the crawling creatures. The one in front withdraws\n\n\tits arm. The grotesque things writhe, kick under the truck. The\n\n\tdoor slams and Peter produces another set of master keys. They\n\n\tare all coded. he falls on the lock mechanism.\n\n\tPeter:\tTHAT'S NOT 100%, BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'LL GET",

His leg is swollen, almost all black. His arm, which\n\n\twas also bitten, is wrapped but oozing.\n\n\tSteve:\tGET MORE VALIUM IN HIM...\n\n\tFran fumbles with one of the hypodermics, but she drops the vial\n\n\tof serum and it shatters on the floor.\n\n\tSteve:\tGET ANOTHER ONE...COME ON...\n\n\tRoger is throwing himself about wildly. Steve barely manages to\n\n\thold on. Fran rushes into the other room.\n\n592\tThe space is starting to look like living quarters. There is\n\n\tfurniture. There are sectioned off areas with things still\n\n\tpacked in cartons, but it is beginning to look like home.\n\n593\tThe woman rushes to the medical supply area which is now more\n\n\torganised with little cabinets and a small refrigerator. She\n\n\ttakes a new vial of serum from the freezer.\n\n594\tDownstairs, Peter is checking the covering at the floor base of\n\n\tthe fake wall. He hears the violent screaming from above.\n\n595\tHe climbs up a rope ladder in the ceiling, scrambles through the\n\n\tgrill in the ceiling, enters the duct. Then he pulls up the\n\n\tladder and closes the grill.\n\n596\tHe crawls through the tight space for a few feet, and drops out\n\n\tof another grill into the washroom.\n\n597\tHe moves through the internal corridor and into the firestair. \n\n598\tAll the while, Roger's screaming can be heard. Peter tramps up\n\n\tthe stairs several at a time.\n\n599\tHe rushes through the living space in the direction of the\n\n\tscreams.\n\n600\tFran is withdrawing a hypodermic from Roger's good arm. The man\n\n\tstill thrashes wildly. Steve is struggling to hold him. Peter\n\n\trushes in and helps. Fran drifts out of the room.\n\n\tAfter a short time Roger relaxes somewhat.\n\n\tPeter:\t(to Steve) GO ON...I'LL STAY WITH HIM.\n\n\tSteve leaves the area.\n\n601\tIn the living spaces, Fran is sitting in a chair. It is the\n\n\tinflatable kind, which can be collapsed like a balloon. Steve\n\n\tcomes up to her and puts his arms around her neck from behind.\n\n\tShe cups his hands with hers and holds them tightly. She stares\n\n\toff across the room.\n\n602\tRoger catches his breath and looks up at Peter. He licks his\n\n\tlips and tries to speak coherently.\n\n\tRoger:\tYOU...YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME, RIGHT, PETER?",
