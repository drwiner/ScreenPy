In CLOSE F.G. is.the back part of a sign. NARRATOR To most of America in 1913, the Age of Innocence had arrived and the stories of the Indian Wars and the Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters had become either barroom ballyhoo or front-porch remiraiscences... .But on both sides of the $io Grande men still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70's and 1 80's -- unchanged. men in a changing land. THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY.. The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are regulation. PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain... Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes in himself and those around him. Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside and against society because he believes in that way of life and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man' according to the righteous... To them he is totally bad, and he wouldn't have it any other way. Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant. Dutch is bigaz good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and regulations. He can sing,. has more than his share of charm, but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one. Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH, dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot tempered and sudden. They work together, eat together and CONTINUED 2. 2 CONTINUED sometimes sleep together with the same whore. Brutal, vicious in a fight, illiterate,. they are always pressing for an advantage and once they get it -- they never let go. They are without loyalty or honor, to anyone except each other and that is limited. A fifth man wears the single stripe of a PFC. This is. AL'GEL. Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle 20's who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not with Villa or Obregon, his was a one-man revolution against them all. He believes in his family, his village and the inherent dignity of. man (some men at least). \" He is faster than his companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he can't. laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride -- Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him, but if it does,. he will have no regrets. REACHING THE SIGN THE MEN STOP. Witut.speaking they, begin to brush off their clothing and get their uniforms in order. 4 THE SIGN READS IN RAILROAD LETTERS: SAN RAFAEL, TEXAS And underneath, someone has printed: Wi12LCO ME TO SAN RAFAEL THE SEVENTH OLDEST TOWN IN SOUTH TEXAS FOUNDED 1703, POPULATION 5 1914, POPULATION 2682 STAY ON AND GROW WITH OUR COMMUNITY PIKE' AND ' DUTCH STARE FOR A MOMENT AT THE SIGN, slightly bemused. _ DUTCH Make you feel welcome? PIKE It helps.. TEC TOR What's it say? ANGEL It invites us to stay with the community and grow. It is here, perhaps with time and small miracle -- that you could be taught to read. CONTINUED 3. 5 CONTINUED Tector looks at Angel for a long moment, then turns to Pike. TECTOR I never enlisted to serve with no smart-mouthed kid. ANGEL Nor I with dogs. DUTCH ITd like to transfer to another unit -- there seems to be dissension in the ranks. PIKE Itll transfer both of you -- just one more word. They look at him silently. He means it. Finally Tike spurs his horse and the group sta'ts for town, CAMERA PANNING. THEM PAST. THE STATt.ON Ai12M BOXCARS into a side street. EXT.. MAIN SQUARE OF SAN RAFAEL DAY THE SQUARE. SHOWS THE MEXICAN/SPANISH INFLUENCE AND.IS CROWDED with weekend visitors. Men,. women and children are. milling about, shopping and idly trading gossip.. The town.has the look of turn of the century Americana along with its.Spanisn heritage. The group of soldiers enter almost unnoticed.- Riding downethe street they pass: A LARGE TENT IN FRONT OF WHICH IS A BANNER ANNOUNCING a W.C.T.U. meeting, which, according to the SOUNDS of the bass drum and a sermon denouncing rum, is presently going on inside. SPEAKER (OS) Leviticus. 10.9. Do not drink wine or strong drink thou,nor thy sons with thee least ye die. It shall be a statute forever. Look. not though. upon. the. wine when it. is red when it giveth his color in the cup when it moveth itself aright at the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder. CONTINUED CONTINUED SPEAKER (OS) (CONTID) That is in the good book.. but here in this town, it is five cents a glass. Five cents a glass, does anyone think that that is really the price of a ----drink? The price of a drink let him decide who has lost his courage and his pride and who lies a govelling heap of clay not far removed from a beast today.- CONGREGATION (OS) I hereby solemnly procaise, God helping me, to abstain from all di stilled, fer- mented and malt ligi34rs3 including wine, beer and cider, and to employ all proper means to discourage the Ilse of and. traffic in the same. AS THE GROUP RIDES AROUND THE SQUARE,. THREE. SOLDIERS, ABE,. PHIL AND BURT, at the hitching rail on one side of the street,. turn and keep pace with the group on horseback. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE THREE OTHER SOLDIERS, BUCK, FRANK AND CRAZY LEE, DO THE SAME. 10 PIKE AND HIS GROUP RIDE PAST THE GENERAL STORE AND THE SALOON. AT Ti12- END OF THE STREET, THEY DISMOUNT ACROSS FROM THE YELLOW AND BROWN RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION BUILDING. As they swing out of the saddle the other ' soldiers' join them. 1l.' PIKE AND HIS COMPANIONS REMOVE EMPTY SADDLE BAGS FROM their horses and step onto the boardwalk or sidewalk that surrounds the'square. Some passersby look curiously. PIKE (after a moment, a little AWKWARDLY) Fall in -- and follow me. The men,. with the 'exception of Tector, Phil and Abe, shuffle into a ragged column of twos. CHANGE 2/12/68 5. 12. PIKE MOVES DOWN THE FILE, looks around. BUCK Real quiet, 'sir.' Pike looks at the horses, then at: 13, THE SIGN OVER THE ENTRANCE OF A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET It reads: PECOS AND SOUTH TEXAS R.R. 14. PIKE PAUSES. FOR A MINUTE and behind him the men surreptitious- ly touch their holstered forty-five automatics. Pike leaves the boardwalk, crossing toward. the railroad office. Tector and Phil stay with the horses. PIKE AND DUTCH, LOOKING AROUND AS THEY LEAVE. THE BOARDWALK, ACCIDENTALLY BUMP INTO A LADY SHOPPER, WHO DROPS HER PACIKAGE. PIKE Beg pardon, Ma'am. DUTCH Let. me, Ma'am. Dutch picks up the package, Pike offers the lady his arm. She hesitates, accepts. Pike and Dutch, followed by the others, lead her across the 'street. 16. ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING OPPOSITE THE RAILROAD OFFICE ARE TEN. MEN STRETCHED OUT BEHIND THE FALSE FRONT T_DLY WATCHING THE CROWD BELOW, THEIR RIFLES AT THEIR SIDES Behind them. on the flat of the roof are open bedrolls, and the remains of at least three meals. It is hot., they have been there a -long time, and they are tired. 17., PAT HARRIGAN, A DAPPER, SELF-IMPORTANT, BACK=SHOOTING RAIL- ROAD EXECUTIVE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MEN -- ALL RAGGED HARDCASES -- frowns a little as he watches the soldiers in the street below. It is. hotter than hell on the tin roof and he is sweating heavily. He turns, edges forward, then nudges: 18, DEKE THORNTON SITTING NEXT TO HIM, his back against the wall, Thornton is a hard-bodied, quiet-spoken man, with a lined face and the embittered manner of someone who has changed sides to stay alive and while part of his life has gone out of him with the change, the personal integrity by which he has lived is still. intact. CONTINUED CHANGE 2/27/68 6. 18 CONTINUED' HARRIGAN The soldiers sit up -- take a look! Thornton straightens, turns slowly, looks -- stiffens a little. HARRIGAN Pike? THORN TON He's there. The bounty hunters react and prepare to fire. Over this shot is the sound of Pike calling to Thornton -- from the past. 19 PIKE REACHES THE DOOR AND WITHOUT PAUSING, murmurs 'goodbye' to the lady and enters, followed by the others, 20 ON THE ROOF, HARRIGAN WHIRLS ON HIS MEN as they begin aim- aing, ready to fire.. HARRIGAN Hold your fire; -- We wait till they come out -- catch them in the act. Then.you kill him or go back to Yuma; Thornton turns toward him, his.face white, remembering- INT. PRISON CELL - DAY AND NIGHT - (MONTAGE EFFECT) JAIL DOORS CLANGING SHUT 20A THORNTON, WRISTS LASHED TO THE BARS OF THE CELL'S window, is being whipped by a guard. 20B THORNTON on the rock pile is making little ones of big ones. EXT. SAN RAFAEL - ROOF TOP DAY 21 T.C. & COFFER, TWO OF THE MEN, POINT TOWARD TECTOR.AND PHIL .standing by the horses. COFFER.& T.C. I can nail himl THORNTON He said wait. T.C. What if they go.out back? COFFER It's covered, you two-bit rednecked peckerwood. The men settle slightly. Thornton remains tense -- then turns as: 7. 22 THE W.C.T.U. BAND AND PARADE START UP AT THE END OF THE STREET ACROSS THE SQUARE. HARR IGAN That's all we needed: INT. PAY OFFICE - DAY 23 THE PAYMASTER IS REPRIMANDING A CLERK. PAYMASTER What -you meant to do does not interest me What you did -- Then, seeing: 24 PIES AND THE OTHERS waiting, he steps to the ody window, smiling with the thought that their visit means. military business for the railroad. His mood. changes as the men draw their\\guns and Pike steps towards him. PAYMASTER What is it?...What do you want? 25 DUTCH., LYLE AND THE. OTHER MEN SWIFTLY MOVE behind the counter. Pike ignores the paymaster and turns to: 26 CRAZY LEE STRINGFELLOW,. a young, compulsive killer with just enough sense to. pour piss out of a boot (if the instructions were printed on the heel: (the instructions are -- to pour, tip!) PIKE If they move, kill them. C.L. grins happily and squats on the floor, his 12 gauge pump shotgun angled up at: 27 THE TERRIFIED PAYMASTER, HIS TWO ASSISTANTS AND MARGARET, A HATCHET-FACED HARRIDAN IN HER FIFTIES i,iho enters the office carrying. a.wrapped package and is instantly shoved into. a corner with the other prisoners. 28 ON THE STREET -- THE W.C.T.U. BASS DRUM BOOMS CLOSER as the parade picks up kids and other scoffing supporters as it moves around the square. . People and their children are crowding through the trees to the boardwalk to watch the band. and group of believers following the_,. in a formation that is almost as rigid as. their song and their faces. 8. 29 ON THE ROOF TOP -- HARRIGAN AND THORNTON NERVOUSLY WATCH THE BAND.. THE OTHER MEN EQUALLY TENSE KEEP THEIR RIFLES TRAINED ON THE DOOR. EARRIGAN Damn them! The parade moves toward the saloon. THO RNTO N They should have been told: HARRI GAN Told-what!? Sus t how. long do you think anyone in this manure pile can keep his mouth shut? Before Thornton can answer: 30 T..C.. SHIFTS TO CHANGE POSITION and his hand. touches the tin roof, ,causing him to.yelp with pain.. The others snap a look in his. direction, then freeze as: 31 'VECTOR ON THE BOARDWALK. LOOKS UP,. SEES NOTHING, leans back against a rail watching the horses and the hymn singers. After a moment, he smiles a little, beating time,. as he remembers some forgotten march he watched from his daddy's shoulders. 32 IN THE PAY OFFICE -- ANGEL CROSSES TO THE WINDOW AS THE NOISE FROM THE PARADE GROWS LOUDER. He looks out Behind hi:: 3.3 PIKE AND THE OTHERS ARE LOADING SACKS OF SILVER into their saddle bags. They are almost ready to. leave. The paymaster, his assistants and the customer, their hands still up, watch C.L. MARGARET Trash -- Filthy trash! C.L. You just. hush now -- ANGEL People marching and singing coming down the street -- going to pass near the horses. CONTINUED 33 CONTINUED C PIKE Well, we'll just join in. Angel, turning away, hesitates, looking up through the window AT: 34 SUNLIGHT GLEAMING OFF THE BARREL OF A GUN ON THE ROOF ACROSS THE STREET ANGEL Rifles -- one -- no three,. maybe more, on the roof. 35 PIKE QUICKLY CROSSES TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKS OUT. PIKE Waiting for us Son of a bitch He turns and crosses quickly to the back door. Dutch follows. Pike opens it a little, looks ou.t at. EXT. REAR OF OFFICE'- DAY 36 FRA?

PIKE How in hell do I know? DUTCH Where do we go? -PIKE Out front -- that's where the horses are.. He shuts the door, crosses toward the paymaster. CONTINUED 10. 37 CONTINTJED C.L. We go ing..out back, Mr. Bishop? PIKE No, son -- we got company there too -- -Besides, when I travel, I like my feet to dangle. C.L. I kill 'em-now? PIKE No. You just hold them here and wait as long as you can -- after the shooting starts. C.L. 111-1 hold 'am till hell freezes over or you say different ! Pike, pushing the frightened paymaster in front of him, hesitates., looks. at C.L., then continues to . the door, grabs the handle, looks back again. 38 C.L.\"IS CROUCHED IN FRONT OF THE TWO ASSISTANTS AND MARGARET., singing to himself, happy as a clam. 39 DUTCH, ANGEL AND THE OTHERS look at Pike. They are ready. 40 PIKE JERKS OPEN THE DOOR,. KICKS THE terrified paymaster out into the street. ON THE ROOF -- THE BOUNTY HUNTERS OPEN FIRE AS THE DOOR FLIES OPEN AND THE PAYMASTER STUMBLES OUT INTO THE STREET INTO THE MIDST OF THE BAND,. screaming as the gunfire cuts him down. The marchers are frozen for a brief instant, then scatter in terror as: 42 PIKE AND THE OTHERS BURST OUT THE DOOR, FIRING AT THE MEN ON THE ROOF. -- RTJNNING TO THEIR HORSES. through the' screaming, terrified marchers. .11 11. IN THE OFFICE -- C.L. WATCHES THE ASSISTANTS AND MARGARET,. IGNORING THE RIFLE SLUGS THAT SMASH THROUGH. THE BUILDING AND INTO THE OFFICE. The sound of the band is drowned out by gunfire and screams. C.L. frowns a little. C.L. They was playing \"Gather at the River.\" You know that one? Then sing it Z AND THEY DO, ALL OF THEM, THEIR VOICES RISING. WITH FERVOR and C.L. joins them, marching up and down,. waving the shotgun in time to the music. A SERIES OF ANGLES THE STREET IS A CONFUSED MELEE AS THE BANDITS RUN FOR THEIR HORSES, TRADING FIRE WITH THE BOUNTY HUNTERS. MEN AND WOMEN, MARCHERS, BANDSMEN AND SPECTATORS RUN FOR COVER, some collide with the bandits,. some hit by the cross- fire fall wounded in the dusty road.

FOLLOWING BEHIND, SWINGS DOWN AND PICKS UP THE BAG, then spurs through the crowd, past Frank and into the tent. Horse, man and tent go down in a cloud of dust and canvas. Then, the horse,.

LAUGHS, FALLS FLATS ROLLS AND BEGINS TO PUMP THE SHOTGUN and everybody dives for cover and opens fire, riddling him with bullets. 84 BUT HE TAKES THE MARSHAL, the deputy and one bounty hunter with him before he is cut to pieces. 85 HARRIGAN AND THORNTON LOOKING DOWN at the shambles in the room, turn as: 86 WAINSCOAT, THE MAYOR, ENTER, FOLLOWED BY A GROUP OF SHOCKED AND IRATE TOWNSPEOPLE. BENSON, a beefy redneck rancher, curses bitterly as he crosses to Harrigan. BENSON We're holding you -- your whole damned rail- road responsible for this carnage -- HARRIGAN Mr. Benson...o WAINSCOAT Innocent people are dead ...women mangled -- dying --because you used our town as a battlefield; You're going to pay, sir -- your-railroad is going to pay for our blood; HARRIGAN Without the railroad this place would still be a lousy little pueblo, so don't make any threats to me; BENSON You can't ambush innocent people. on our street!

HARRIGAN (OS) I can. assure you that there won't be any more trouble... . My men will follow -- BENSON (OS) Your men enter this town again and they will be shot on sight; Thornton ignores them, slowly rolling a cigarette, looking after Pike. Harrigan exits, crosses to Thornton. HARRIGAN I pulled. you out of jail to get- that bunch -- and you failed -- THORNTON . You gave the ordersl If you want the job done right -- you keep the hell out of it next time - You and the rest of your railroad trash\" I'll do it -- but my way. - - HARRIGAN What.makes you think there'll be a next time for you? What makes you think you're not going back behind bars for twenty more years? Thornton's face twists as he hears again the clanging of cell doors and the whimpering of prisoners.. THORNTON Because I'm all you've got Because I know him. Because you know I'll get him -- I'll kill him rather than go-back. CONTINUED 18. 88 CONTINUED HARRI GAN Twice .he' s made a fool of me - He never will again. You know why you're here -- (before Thornton can ANSWER) Not because you're good -- because I want him dead -- at your hands -- the hands of his old friend, his partner -- THO RNTON IT 11 get him -- you have my word. EXT. DRY ARROYO - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON EFFECT) 89 THE WILD BUNCH RIDES DOWN A STEEP TRAIL INTO A DRY ARROYO They are weary, but determined. Buck, last in line, covered with blood, is swaying in the saddle. Although severely wounded, he still clutches the bags of silver. 90 REACHING THE BOTTOM OF THE ARROYO THE MEN SPUR their horses across the d r y stream bed and up the steep bank on. t he other side. 91 DUTCH AND PIKE ARE IN THE LEAD. BEHIND THEM THE OTHERS LUNGE UP IN SINGLE FILE. Angel, second to last, reaches the top, turns as: 92 BUCK, NOW COMPLETELY BLIND, FALLS BACKWARD OVER THE REAR OF HIS HORSE, HITS THE GROUND AND SOMERSAULTS BACKWARDS TO THE BOTTOM, still clutching the saddle bags. 93 ANGEL PULLS UP and calls to Pike. ANGEL Fijate. 94 BUCK, ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES, MOANS WITH PAIN as he attempts to crawl up the slope. 95 PIKE RIDES DOWN TO HIM,. SWINGS OFF EIS HORSE and stands looking down. CHANGE 2/12/68 19. 96 THE BLIND MAN, HEARING HIM,, gropes in his direction. 97 PIKE GENTLY TAKES THE BAGS OF SILVER. OUT OF BUCK'S HAND. Buck lurches forward, grabbing at Pike who steps back, Pike crosses to his horse, and painfully climbs into the saddle. BUCK (dying, almost incoherent with pain) I kin still -ride...I can't see, but I kin ride... - (then) No, I can't -- Finish it, Mr. Bishop. 98 PIKE. DRAWS HIS GUN P41 D FIRES 99 BUCK, ON HIS KNEES, a IS CAUGHT SQUARE BY THE. SHO T AND HURLED OVER BACKWARDS. He slides several feet over the smooth, round pebbles of the wash, then is still. Pike turns his horse and spurs it . up the slope. 100 THE MEN WATCH SILENTLY AS PIKE RIDES UP. and halts. They don't move, all looking down-at-Buck. PIKE (after a. long moment, trying to cover the loss) You boys want to move on -- or stay here and give him a 'decent burial'.? TECTOR Well,. he was a good man -- PIKE He's dead! And he's got a 'lot of 'good men? back there to keep him company. LYLE Too damn many. DUTCH I'd like. to say a. few kind words for all the departed -- then perhaps a hymn or two would be in order -- followed by a' church supper with a choir. CONTINTED 20. 100 CONTINUED LYLE Crazy bastards -- both of you l Tector follows his brother, cursing.. 101 PIKE AND DUTCH LOOK AT EACH OTHER silently -- try to grin -- finally make it -- then follow. The bunch is attentive, but now certain that they are not being closely followed, they can relax a little.. Pike and Dutch are side by side.

Lyle.and-Tector,. then they move up the village street.. 465 FOUR MEN IN LINE AND THE AIR OF IMPENDING VIOLENCE IS SO STRONG around them that as they pass through the celebrating soldiers, the song and the laughter begin to die. INT. RUINED HACIENDA - NIGHT 466 MAPACHE, THE GERMANS, ZAMORRA, HERRERA AND SIX OR SEVEN of their officers and a handful of women are seated-at a long center table.. Food and liquor bottles are spilled every- where, the mariachi band plays for: 466A CHITA, A SCARED, NOT UNATTRACTIVE GIRL who is trying to please the general by dancing on the table. At other tables are more officers and perhaps thirty or so enlisted men. The machine gun mounted on its tripod is in a far corner.. 467 ANGEL LIES ON THE FLOOR, nearly unconscious, almost unrecog- nizable from. the beating he has taken.. CONTINUED CHANGE 2/12/68 121. 467 CONTINUED F Mapache watches the dancer, then angrily kicks her off the table.

ZAMORRA Hey, this Dog lost those gringos you wanted - but.we kill 'em tomorrow -- naw. you go on and get out of here; PIKE We want Angel; Mapache stares at them without answering. ZAMORRA. You are very stupid...very stupid! 464 SUDDENLY MAPACHE LURCHES UP FROM THE TABLE, CROSSES TO ANGEL AND LIFTS HIM TO HIS FEET. Half dragging him, he steps in front' of the Americans. Around him many of the soldiers are rising. - 470 PIKE WATCHES UNMOVING AS MAPACHE PROPS up Angel from behind, grins at them. MAPACHE You want him..,? He takes a knife and cuts the rope binding. Angel's hands. 471. ANGEL-BARELY ABLE TO STAND, REACTS with disbelief.. 472 PIKE AND DJTCH WATCH without a movement, without a sound. MAPACHE Take him... 473 TECTOR AND LYLE IGNORE MAPACHE, THEIR eyes drifting over the Mexicans who are slowly edging forward,some beginning to grin. 122. 474 ZAMORRA, STILL SEATED at the table pours himself a drink, the clink of the glass against the bottle loud in the silence. Beside him the.Germans rise slowly. Mapache, still holding Angel from behind, leans over his shoulder and whispers in his ear: MAPACHE Vete, Angelito:..te esperan. los. gringitos... 475 ANGEL STANDS FAST, then curiously he takes a step forward. 476 PIKE. AND THE OTHERS REMAIN MOTIONLESS 477 ANGEL'S FACE BEGINS to brighten with hope and he takes another step,. then: 478 MAPACHE GRABS HIM.BY THE HAIR and his other hand flashes across the boy's throat as he shoves Angel-into the Americans, the blood splattering them from his severed throat. .479 AS PIKE STEPS BACK TO AVOID-Angel's falling body, he draws his forty-five automatic and fires twice into Mapache. 480 THE BULLETS DOUBLE HIM AND HURL HIM INTO.HIS MEN. As he CRUMPLES: 481 DUTCH.FIRES INTO THE TOP OF HIS. HEAD, then the room explodes with gunfire. ,482 ZAMORRA AND TWO OF THE OTHERS scramble for cover while drawing. Mohr runs for the machine gun. Ri12fle fire erupts from the courtyard as the soldiers rush forward and die as: 483 ONE OF DUTCH'S GRENADES explodes amongst them. 484 PIKE, FIRING WITH AMAZING rapidity empties his ,45, shoves it in his belt, cocks the lever on the rifle, moving slowly but steadily into the shadowed corners of the room -- kill- ing men, firing, being shot at and hit in return. CHANGE 2/12/68 123. 485 DUTCH EMPTYING his .44, throwing another grenade, is hit, draws his .45, continues firing, moving with Pike, covering his back. 486 THE SOLDIES HUNT COVER and die -- more pour in from the courtyard and die caught in the cross fire. 487 TECTOR AND LYLE YELLING with the lust of battle charge toward the table, emptying their guns. 488 MOHR.REACHES THE MACHINE GUN, begins firing. Kills a number of soldiers as it gets away from him. 489 PIKE KILLS HIM with his last two rifle shots and the German dies with his finger locked. on the trigger. 490 THE GUN SWINGS, cutting a swath of death across the room, killing s.ix soldiers,wzunding Dutch. 491 PIKE: THROWS THE RIFLE. as he slips a. now clip in the .45, whirls as: .492 ZAMORRA PUTS three rounds into Dutch. 493 PIKE KILLS ZAMORRA AND HERRERA, then a soldier has driven a bayonet through his gut and into the wall. 494 DUTCH, ON THE FLOOR, KILLS THE SOLDIER 495' MEXICANS CONTINUE FIRING AT THE AMERICANS from all sides and the Gorch brothers, badly wounded,. but still on their feet still are blasting away at them from the middle of the room, then Tector, laughing, picks up. the screaming, terrified Chita and, rushes the crowd, using the woman for a shield. She tosses her head and dies as bullets slam into her soft body, then he is.hit again and goes down on one knee. 496 A SOLDIER, UNSEEN BY.TECTOR', steps into a doorway. He aims at Tecto'r with a revolver and fires Into him from several feet away. The bullets tear into Tector and he drops the woman and dances out into the room. As he is hit. from all sides, he whirls around, seeing: CHANGE 2/12/68 12th. 497 THE MAN IN THE DOORWAY, he fires his last shot into the man's body. The man plunges forward screaming. Tector stands up straight as bullets pour into him. Finally, he crumples fast and falls, :; 498 LYLE., HIT SEVERAL TIMES, SCREAMING WITH RAGE, standing over Tector is wild-eyed, firing madly into the crowd. A bullet splashes into his cheek and he runs..at. the nearest of his attackers, firing, scattering them, killing most, 499 TECTOR RISES, CLICKS HIS EMPTY pistol at. the mob. A soldier rushes him from behind with a machete and the cross fire of his own men kills him as he swings the weapon into TectorPs back. Tector falls to the floor,. writhing in pain, cursing, pulling down a soldier, strangling him as he dies, 500 LYLE STAGGERS, BULLETS PUMPING into him, then falls - dead before he hits the ground. The soldiers continue to fire into. his body, 501 DUTCH LIFTS A SOLDIER AND TOSSES him against the wall, then falls as bullets cut into him. He rolls, then.crawls under the tables dragging the useless lower half'of his body. Al- thotgh in pain, he is grinning strangely. He removes a car- bine from a dead soldier and. props himself on a bench. Taking careful aim,, he fires and a 'soldier drops screaming-.and. kicking. Methodically he aims and fires again, and again and again, a man dying each time he pulls the trigger.. 502. PIKE WATCHES AS HE TENSES, FINALLY JERKS THE BAYONET out of his body, runs firing at five of the soldiers. who are rushing the room -- kills two,. reaches the machine gun, pulls Mohr away from the gun, ,jerks back the bolt. and staggers as a soldier empties his pistol into him from behind, Pike him- self turns and dies, 503 DUTCH SWINGS THE RIFLE, firing, crippling the soldier, then: 504 ANOTHER SOLDIER, HIS UNIFORM STAINED WITH BLOOD, draws his knife and hardly able to move, falls on Dutch -- the weight of the.fall-burying the weapon deep into Dutch's back. Crumpled together, both.men die, EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT 505 FOR A FEW SECONDS THERE IS STILL sporadic gunfire as the re- maining soldiers fire into the bodies of the wild bunch.. CONTINUED CHANGE 2/12/68 125. 505 CONTINUED Then it stops. A mortally. wounded man suddenly screams in agony and writhes on the floor and dies. Another, pistol in hand, rises, staggers to the gateway, teeters for a moment, then falls, firing blindly into the. dust. Somewhere outside the wall, a cur yelps and runs away into the night, DISSOLVE TO: EXT. AGUA VERDE - GATE..- DAY 505A THE BOUNTY HUNTERS led by Thornton, ride through. It appears deserted, _ EXT. HACIENDA COURTYARD - DAY 506 IN THE COURTYARD A SMALL GROUP OF WOMEN wrapped in. black robosas are burning candles and moving. among the dead bodies. that spill out of the large room of the hacienda and into the yard. It is a scene of carnage, blood now black in.the sun, a million flies and the walls lined with waiting vultures. There is no sign of soldiers anywhere.. A few of the bodies have been dragged into the courtyard. Most, including Pike, Dutch and the others, including Mapache, lie where they fell. 507 THE BOUNTY HUNTERS, LED BY THORNTON, RIDE UP TO THE ARCHES AND DISMOUNT, their horses snorting nervously at the smell of blood and the stench of death. At-the end of the courtyard where five corpses are heaped in a small Di13, a lone vulture stands. patiently near them. As the bounty hunters approach and the-.bird labors reluctantly into flight, the men dismount. Thornton, looking in through the broken wall, turns away. Coffer and T.C. enter, whistle softly.. COFFER It's them. THORNTON You'd have.one hell of a time proving that.a week from now, in Texas. -COFFER. We could try...Hell, a pelt's a pelt, it don't matter what condition it's in. T.C.

In CLOSE F.G. is.the back part of a sign. NARRATOR To most of America in 1913, the Age of Innocence had arrived and the stories of the Indian Wars and the Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters had become either barroom ballyhoo or front-porch remiraiscences... .But on both sides of the $io Grande men still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70's and 1 80's -- unchanged. men in a changing land. THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY.. The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are regulation. PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain... Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes in himself and those around him. Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside and against society because he believes in that way of life and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man' according to the righteous... To them he is totally bad, and he wouldn't have it any other way. Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant. Dutch is bigaz good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and regulations. He can sing,. has more than his share of charm, but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one. Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH, dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot tempered and sudden. They work together, eat together and CONTINUED 2. 2 CONTINUED sometimes sleep together with the same whore. Brutal, vicious in a fight, illiterate,. they are always pressing for an advantage and once they get it -- they never let go. They are without loyalty or honor, to anyone except each other and that is limited. A fifth man wears the single stripe of a PFC. This is. AL'GEL. Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle 20's who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not with Villa or Obregon, his was a one-man revolution against them all. He believes in his family, his village and the inherent dignity of. man (some men at least). \" He is faster than his companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he can't. laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride -- Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him, but if it does,. he will have no regrets. REACHING THE SIGN THE MEN STOP. Witut.speaking they, begin to brush off their clothing and get their uniforms in order. 4 THE SIGN READS IN RAILROAD LETTERS: SAN RAFAEL, TEXAS And underneath, someone has printed: Wi12LCO ME TO SAN RAFAEL THE SEVENTH OLDEST TOWN IN SOUTH TEXAS FOUNDED 1703, POPULATION 5 1914, POPULATION 2682 STAY ON AND GROW WITH OUR COMMUNITY PIKE' AND ' DUTCH STARE FOR A MOMENT AT THE SIGN, slightly bemused. _ DUTCH Make you feel welcome? PIKE It helps.. TEC TOR What's it say? ANGEL It invites us to stay with the community and grow. It is here, perhaps with time and small miracle -- that you could be taught to read. CONTINUED 3. 5 CONTINUED Tector looks at Angel for a long moment, then turns to Pike. TECTOR I never enlisted to serve with no smart-mouthed kid. ANGEL Nor I with dogs. DUTCH ITd like to transfer to another unit -- there seems to be dissension in the ranks. PIKE Itll transfer both of you -- just one more word. They look at him silently. He means it. Finally Tike spurs his horse and the group sta'ts for town, CAMERA PANNING. THEM PAST. THE STATt.ON Ai12M BOXCARS into a side street. EXT.. MAIN SQUARE OF SAN RAFAEL DAY THE SQUARE. SHOWS THE MEXICAN/SPANISH INFLUENCE AND.IS CROWDED with weekend visitors. Men,. women and children are. milling about, shopping and idly trading gossip.. The town.has the look of turn of the century Americana along with its.Spanisn heritage. The group of soldiers enter almost unnoticed.- Riding downethe street they pass: A LARGE TENT IN FRONT OF WHICH IS A BANNER ANNOUNCING a W.C.T.U. meeting, which, according to the SOUNDS of the bass drum and a sermon denouncing rum, is presently going on inside. SPEAKER (OS) Leviticus. 10.9. Do not drink wine or strong drink thou,nor thy sons with thee least ye die. It shall be a statute forever. Look. not though. upon. the. wine when it. is red when it giveth his color in the cup when it moveth itself aright at the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder. CONTINUED CONTINUED SPEAKER (OS) (CONTID) That is in the good book.. but here in this town, it is five cents a glass. Five cents a glass, does anyone think that that is really the price of a ----drink? The price of a drink let him decide who has lost his courage and his pride and who lies a govelling heap of clay not far removed from a beast today.- CONGREGATION (OS) I hereby solemnly procaise, God helping me, to abstain from all di stilled, fer- mented and malt ligi34rs3 including wine, beer and cider, and to employ all proper means to discourage the Ilse of and. traffic in the same.

PIKE AND HIS COMPANIONS REMOVE EMPTY SADDLE BAGS FROM their horses and step onto the boardwalk or sidewalk that surrounds the'square. Some passersby look curiously. PIKE (after a moment, a little AWKWARDLY) Fall in -- and follow me. The men,. with the 'exception of Tector, Phil and Abe, shuffle into a ragged column of twos. CHANGE 2/12/68 5. 12.

FOR A MINUTE and behind him the men surreptitious- ly touch their holstered forty-five automatics. Pike leaves the boardwalk, crossing toward. the railroad office. Tector and Phil stay with the horses. PIKE AND DUTCH, LOOKING AROUND AS THEY LEAVE. THE BOARDWALK, ACCIDENTALLY BUMP INTO A LADY SHOPPER, WHO DROPS HER PACIKAGE. PIKE Beg pardon, Ma'am. DUTCH Let. me, Ma'am. Dutch picks up the package, Pike offers the lady his arm. She hesitates, accepts. Pike and Dutch, followed by the others, lead her across the 'street. 16. ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING OPPOSITE THE RAILROAD OFFICE ARE TEN. MEN STRETCHED OUT BEHIND THE FALSE FRONT T_DLY WATCHING THE CROWD BELOW, THEIR RIFLES AT THEIR SIDES Behind them. on the flat of the roof are open bedrolls, and the remains of at least three meals. It is hot., they have been there a -long time, and they are tired. 17., PAT HARRIGAN, A DAPPER, SELF-IMPORTANT, BACK=SHOOTING RAIL- ROAD EXECUTIVE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MEN -- ALL RAGGED HARDCASES -- frowns a little as he watches the soldiers in the street below. It is. hotter than hell on the tin roof and he is sweating heavily. He turns, edges forward, then nudges: 18, DEKE THORNTON SITTING NEXT TO HIM, his back against the wall, Thornton is a hard-bodied, quiet-spoken man, with a lined face and the embittered manner of someone who has changed sides to stay alive and while part of his life has gone out of him with the change, the personal integrity by which he has lived is still. intact. CONTINUED CHANGE 2/27/68 6. 18 CONTINUED' HARRIGAN The soldiers sit up -- take a look! Thornton straightens, turns slowly, looks -- stiffens a little. HARRIGAN Pike? THORN TON He's there. The bounty hunters react and prepare to fire. Over this shot is the sound of Pike calling to Thornton -- from the past. 19 PIKE REACHES THE DOOR AND WITHOUT PAUSING, murmurs 'goodbye' to the lady and enters, followed by the others, 20 ON THE ROOF, HARRIGAN WHIRLS ON HIS MEN as they begin aim- aing, ready to fire.. HARRIGAN Hold your fire; -- We wait till they come out -- catch them in the act. Then.you kill him or go back to Yuma; Thornton turns toward him, his.face white, remembering- INT.

BAND AND PARADE START UP AT THE END OF THE STREET ACROSS THE SQUARE. HARR IGAN That's all we needed: INT. PAY OFFICE - DAY 23 THE PAYMASTER IS REPRIMANDING A CLERK. PAYMASTER What -you meant to do does not interest me What you did -- Then, seeing: 24 PIES AND THE OTHERS waiting, he steps to the ody window, smiling with the thought that their visit means. military business for the railroad. His mood. changes as the men draw their\\guns and Pike steps towards him. PAYMASTER What is it?...What do you want? 25 DUTCH., LYLE AND THE. OTHER MEN SWIFTLY MOVE behind the counter. Pike ignores the paymaster and turns to: 26 CRAZY LEE STRINGFELLOW,. a young, compulsive killer with just enough sense to. pour piss out of a boot (if the instructions were printed on the heel: (the instructions are -- to pour, tip!) PIKE If they move, kill them.

BASS DRUM BOOMS CLOSER as the parade picks up kids and other scoffing supporters as it moves around the square. . People and their children are crowding through the trees to the boardwalk to watch the band. and group of believers following the_,. in a formation that is almost as rigid as. their song and their faces. 8. 29 ON THE ROOF TOP -- HARRIGAN AND THORNTON NERVOUSLY WATCH THE BAND.. THE OTHER MEN EQUALLY TENSE KEEP THEIR RIFLES TRAINED ON THE DOOR. EARRIGAN Damn them! The parade moves toward the saloon. THO RNTO N They should have been told: HARRI GAN Told-what!?
