      "content": "FADE IN: 1 NEW YORK CITY - PARK AVENUE - NIGHT - 1982 1 A TAXI pulls over to a curb where an ELDERLY MAN waits with his MIDDLE-AGED SON in THE RAIN. MIDDLE-AGED SON 23rd and Lex. The CABBIE grunts a reply. MIDDLE-AGED SON (CONT'D) How ya doin', Papa, you doin' alright? ELDERLY MAN Fine, fine... MIDDLE-AGED SON This is just a check-up, okay? Doctor Katz says you'll outlive us all. Traffic isn't bad. We should be back in time to watch the Mets. He notices his father is STARING, wide-eyed, at the cabby's HACK LICENSE. We glimpse only the last name...\"Bielski.\" MIDDLE-AGED SON (CONT'D) Papa? .Papa, what is it? IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR, the old man catches the furtive eyes of the cabby. ELDERLY MAN ...You. Can it be? The eyes in the mirror look away. And then back. ELDERLY MAN (CONT'D) Bielski. Can it possibly be? As we PUSH IN on the eyes in the mirror, we HEAR THE DESPERATE RASPING SOUND OF PANTING. CUT TO: 2 A MAN RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE THROUGH THE WOODS. 2 Bombs EXPLODE all around as he passes dead bodies and BURNT- OUT VEHICLES. Without slowing he discards a WW II Red Army helmet, a field jacket, a heavy pack, anything that might impede his flight. He glances back up over his shoulder. The sky is filled with BOMBERS. He runs on. SALMON Revision - 8-18-07 2. 3 OMITTED 3 4 THE VILLAGE OF NALIBOKI 4 A typical Eastern European shtetl. LOCAL POLICE help German Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing squads, round up Jews. PEASANTS beat them with sticks as they are herded into lines. One man tries to run and is beaten. Others look on, or look away with indifference as they are loaded onto waiting trucks. 5 TWO MEN HIDE IN THE NEARBY WOODS (ZUS & ASAEL BIELSKI) 5 We study their faces: a turbulent portrait of impotent rage, terrible fear, overwhelming grief, and secret relief. ASAEL Where are they taking them? ZUS --Shveig! Shveig! ASAEL BUT-- ZUS Just shut up! Please... 6 AN ALLEY WAY IN NOVAGRUDOK 6 The man we last saw in flight (TUVIA BIELSKI) wearing the remnants of his uniform, slips down a cobble-stoned street. He ducks into a doorway as A PATROL passes by. 6A A REMOTE FARM 6A Zus and Asael move warily through a barnyard. A tethered dog BARKS furiously. A farmer challenges them. WALENCKI WHAT DO YOU WANT? Walencki brandishes a pitchfork. ASAEL Some food...? WALENCKI They are looking for you people. The two brothers glance nervously around. WALENCKI (CONT'D) Get away from here! GO! ZUS, the older of the two brothers, takes a menacing step toward the farmer but his younger brother holds him back. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 3. 6A CONTINUED: 6A ASAEL Zus. Let's go. As they retreat toward the woods, Zus warns the farmer. ZUS We'll be back. 7 A BOURGEOIS APARTMENT -- DAY 7 Tuvia is getting dressed as AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN -- his wife, RIFKA -- stands by the window, smoking a cigarette. TUVIA And no news of my brothers? RIFKA They are used to trouble, they'll be all right. TUVIA If you stay, you'll have to go to the ghetto. RIFKA I can get false papers and pass as a gentile. So can you. Tuvia shakes his head, no. He finishes dressing. Theirs is a relationship long past passion. RIFKA (CONT'D) Will you at least stay tonight? TUVIA I need to see to my family. Will you come? RIFKA To the country? No. CUT TO: 8 A MODEST MILL - LATER THAT DAY 8 A PAIR OF LEGS lie motionless behind a trough. Beyond, A MAN'S TORSO. Zus and Asael stare in mute horror. ASAEL Papa-- Gottenyu... Flies buzz about dead LIVESTOCK. A WOMAN'S BODY lies nearby. 9 IN THE HOUSE 9 A still portrait of a life interrupted. DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 4. 9 CONTINUED: 9 A table set for dinner. Candles lit. An open book. A NOISE from a cupboard. Zus grabs a hatchet. From the root cellar, a YOUNG BOY, 14, appears. His face is dirty and tear-streaked. They go to embrace him. ASAEL Aron. The boy (ARON) recoils. He is disoriented and WILL NOT SPEAK. 9A EXT. MODEST MILL - MOMENTS LATER 9A Loaded down with possessions, Asael hurries back to the woods. Zus pauses long enough to pry the mezuzah from the door. CUT TO: 10 THE FOREST AT DUSK 10 Aron stares mutely straight ahead. Asael is shaking uncontrollably and crying. Zus is at a loss what to do. ZUS Stop it... But Asael is lost in a confusion of grief and panic. ZUS (CONT'D) Stop it. STOP IT! Finally Zus grabs him in a gesture halfway between violence and comfort...and holds him as Asael rocks back and forth. CUT TO: 11 THE NALIBOKI FOREST AT DAWN - VIEWED FROM ABOVE 11 A million acres of dense, impenetrable woods and swamps. 12 ASAEL AND ARON SLEEP HUDDLED ON THE GROUND 12 The sound of a FOOTSTEP. They sit up in terror. TUVIA If I was a German you are dead. ASAEL Tuvia! Asael leaps up to embrace him as if he were salvation itself. ASAEL (CONT'D) Papa and Mama. They killed them. TAN Revision - 9-10-07 5. 12 CONTINUED: 12 Asael clings to him. Even Aron allows himself to be held. Tuvia hold them silently. Zus appears, hatchet in hand. ZUS Big brother returns. Tuvia and Zus look at each other warily. ZUS (CONT'D) You saw them? Yes. Tuvia saw them. Zus takes the mezuzah from his pocket, tosses it to Tuvia. ZUS (CONT'D) Welcome home. 13 LATER - THE NALIBOCKI FOREST - A LOAF OF STALE BREAD 13 is torn apart by filthy hands as they move through the trees. ASAEL Are you going back to the army? TUVIA There is no more army. Asael worships his big brother. ZUS Hope at least you killed a few. Tuvia just stares at him. ASAEL What is it like? To be in a war? TUVIA It wasn't war. It was something else. Zus eyes him carefully. TUVIA (CONT'D) Where is Sonia and the baby? ZUS Horodysze. Hiding in a cellar. I'll bring her when it is safe. Where is Rifka? TUVIA In Novgrudok. She wouldn't leave. ZUS You are still separated? TUVIA She is still my wife. YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 6. 13 CONTINUED: 13 ZUS Your rich wife. Zus chews with the open-mouthed relish of a peasant. ZUS (CONT'D) So why exactly have you come back? Tuvia just stares at him. The reason is obvious as he holds his younger brothers. ZUS (CONT'D) You have a plan? TUVIA No. Do you? CUT TO: 14 POURING RAIN - A NEW HIDE-OUT (CAMP #1) 14 Shivering and miserable, they are trying to start a fire. Asael's few remaining matches are sodden. TUVIA Is there anything left to eat? Only a few potatoes in Asael's bag. WORMS writhe among them. ASAEL Zus finished the last of the sausage. Tuvia glares at Zus, who glares back. Sibling rivals. ZUS Stankowicz' farm is closest. ASAEL He has dogs. ZUS Fuck the dogs. Wilencki then. TUVIA You think Wilencki is going to give us food? ZUS No. We take it. TUVIA How? ZUS We...Take...It. SALMON Revision - 8-18-07 7. 14 CONTINUED: 14 TUVIA And he tells the police. ZUS I have run from the police my whole life. Do you really think it's a good time to stop? A moment of decision. Who holds the balance of power? ASAEL We know these woods. They'll never find us in here. Tuvia looks at his brothers. He has been outvoted. CUT TO: 15 THE SMALL FARMHOUSE 15 where Zus and Asael first tried to get food. Asael waits outside, anxiously on guard. 16 INSIDE 16 The farmer (WALENCKI) who threatened them with the pitchfork sits eating a simple dinner. Zus and Tuvia burst in. Zus brandishes a hoe. ZUS We want food. Be quick about it! WALENCKI You again! ZUS NOW! WALENCKI Sure, sure. Take what you want... Tuvia begins to stuff provisions into a sack. ZUS Where is your gun, farmer? WALENCKI I have no gun. Zus grabs a dinner plate and SMASHES IT IN THE FARMER'S FACE. ZUS WHERE IS YOUR GUN? Holding his bloody face, the farmer cowers in fear. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 8. 16 CONTINUED: 16 WALENCKI Please... Zus kicks him. WALENCKI (CONT'D) I beg you... TUVIA ZUS-- ZUS He's lying. He kicks him again. The farmer begins to weep. ZUS (CONT'D) You're lying! Zus dumps the remains of the farmer's dinner onto him. ZUS (CONT'D) If I hit you once more, you will shit your pants. Twice and you will never shit again. The farmer knows Zus won't hesitate. WALENCKI Up there... Zus kicks the man aside. Above the stove is an old rifle. Zus grabs it, points it at the farmer. ZUS We were never here. CUT TO: 17 THE BROTHERS 17 running through the woods. Zus raises the rifle in triumph. TUVIA He was willing to help us. ZUS He's lucky I didn't crush his head. TAN Revision - 9-10-07 9. 17 CONTINUED: 17 ZUS (CONT'D) Fucking Polack. I've eaten shit from these people long enough! TUVIA This is your plan? To terrorize every anti-Semite in Belorussia? ZUS No. Some I will kill. CUT TO: 18 ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST 18 Aron has been left alone. He holds a STICK which he \"shoots\" like a gun -- kachew -- as he creeps from tree to tree. Aron freezes. SOMETHING is moving in the trees. He crouches. A dark blur. An animal? It moves off. He follows. The shape appears again. It's a SMALL GIRL, roughly Aron's age. Aron waves at her. The girl stares, then runs off. Aron hurries after her into a wooded grove, then stops short. A PILE OF NAKED CORPSES. Overflows a newly-dug trench. The small girl runs to A MIDDLE-AGED MAN with a crude Star-of-David sewn to his tattered coat. He holds an OLDER GIRL, 14, in his arms. Nearby, three or four OTHERS emerge from hiding. Starved, in tatters, the living waiting to die. CUT TO: 19 A CLEARING (CAMP #1) - LATER 19 where the three brothers gorge themselves on stolen food. Someone FARTS loudly. ZUS Ah... ASAEL You know what Papa would do when you did that at table... Tuvia smacks Zus on the head, taking on a gruff voice. TUVIA Peasant. TAN Revision - 9-10-07 10. 19 CONTINUED: 19 Tuvia imitates his father's criticism of Zus. Asael laughs. Zus can't help but laugh as well. Even in grief there is laughter. A glimpse of ties that bind them. ASAEL I can't believe Papa's dead. ZUS Bernicki. ASAEL The police captain? TUVIA We don't know he did it. ZUS He always had it in for Papa. TUVIA We don't know he did it. ZUS So we will go and ask him if he did. ASAEL Koscik has a pistol. He showed it to me once. ZUS One pistol isn't enough. We need rifles. Machine guns. TUVIA Machine guns? You're going to take on the whole German army? ZUS Just because you didn't... The SOUND of footsteps. Zus jumps up cocking the rifle. ARON emerges from the trees. And then, behind him, THE SURVIVORS he discovered among the corpses. THE MIDDLE-AGED MAN holds a teenage GIRL by one hand and carries his younger daughter. MIDDLE-AGED MAN The child is hurt. The brothers stare at him. Wary and unwelcoming. TUVIA Set her down. The man lowers the child to the ground. She isn't moving. MIDDLE-AGED MAN I am Avram Rubinski. This is my daughter. She-- The Germans-- GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 11. 19 CONTINUED: (2) 19 He cannot bring himself to say the words. OTHERS shuffle forward, still in shock, barely able to speak their gratitude as Tuvia offers chunks of bread and cheese. The man tries to feed his daughter. She is barely alive. Asael turns to Aron. Gently. ASAEL Where did you find them? Aron still won't speak. Asael addresses the other girl. ASAEL (CONT'D) Your sister is sick? LITTLE GIRL (RACHEL) They kept her for a week. We fill in the rest. ZUS (O.S.) TUVIA-- Zus has moved out of earshot. Tuvia joins him. ZUS (CONT'D) We cannot feed them. TUVIA I'll go ask Koscik for food. ZUS And the pistol. TUVIA And the pistol. Without another word, he starts off. ZUS Remember to say please. CUT TO: 20 A RUSSIAN-MADE MAHKAROV REVOLVER. 20 Koscik, a rotund, florid-faced Pole, hands it to Tuvia. KOSCIK I have only four bullets. BLUE Revision - 6-26-07 12. 20 CONTINUED: 20 TUVIA I cannot thank you enough. They sit in Koscik's warmly-lit kitchen. Koscik's WIFE stands silently by the stove, glaring at Tuvia. KOSCIK Your father was a good man. TUVIA He said the same of you. Tuvia can't help but notice Koscik's wife giving him the evil eye. Koscik produces a bottle of vodka. KOSCIK Ignore the bitch. To the dead. God rest their souls. Bitch-- Do you want vodka? His wife just glares at him. KOSCIK (CONT'D) I live with this, can you imagine? HEADLIGHTS sweep over the window. A CAR is fast approaching. KOSCIK (CONT'D) Hide yourself. ...The barn. 21 TUVIA HURRIES ACROSS THE COURTYARD AND INTO THE BARN. 21 22 IN THE LOFT 22 He climbs a ladder and is startled to find FIVE MORE MEN AND WOMEN in hiding. They stare in mute terror. 23 OUTSIDE THE BARN 23 Koscik greets A BELARUSSIAN POLICE CAPTAIN and his SONS as they exit the car. They speak in Russian, with subtitles: KOSCIK Working late, boys. POLICE CAPTAIN Hunting Jews. Our new bosses are very organized. Koscik offers the bottle. KOSCIK Hunting can work up a thirst. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 13. 23 CONTINUED: 23 POLICE CAPTAIN Fifteen in one day. The council is offering a year's free tax for every one you turn in. - KOSCIK A Jew is worth that much? Do you pay more for a fat one? They laugh appreciatively. 24 IN THE LOFT 24 A man COUGHS then shrugs an apology. Tuvia glares at him. 25 BACK TO THE COURTYARD 25 POLICE CAPTAIN Caught five of them hiding in a ditch. Smelled so bad I was afraid the Germans wouldn't want them. KOSCIK Maybe for a reduced price. More laughter. More vodka. POLICE CAPTAIN You know the Bielski's? KOSCIK Sure. POLICE CAPTAIN We missed two when we visited the parents. 26 IN THE LOFT 26 Tuvia listens to this casual talk of his parent's death. 27 BACK IN THE COURTYARD 27 POLICE CAPTAIN Anybody caught helping them is in for it. You know this, Koscik? KOSCIK Do I look like an idiot? Don't answer so quickly... More laughter. The Police Captain looks at his watch. Yawns. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 14. 27 CONTINUED: 27 POLICE CAPTAIN Been at it since dawn. The wife doesn't like these long nights. He tries to hand back the bottle to Koscik. KOSCIK Keep it. POLICE CAPTAIN Bribing an officer of the law? Maybe you have more of this black market vodka hidden in the barn? KOSCIK Take a look. And clean out the cow shit while you're back there. The policeman laughs and climbs back into the car. POLICE CAPTAIN You'll keep your eyes open, yes? KOSCIK Good hunting. 28 MOMENTS LATER - IN THE BARN 28 Koscik and Tuvia speak in harsh whispers. KOSCIK --If the laborers find them tomorrow, I will be denounced-- TUVIA What am I supposed to do with-- KOSCIK Take them into the forest-- TUVIA --And feed them how? I can't care for my own family. Behind them, several of the REFUGEES have emerged from their hiding place. They stare at Tuvia balefully. 29 MOMENTS LATER - BY THE ROADSIDE 29 The refugees are loaded with provisions. A young man, PINCHAS ZUCKERMAN, has a tethered GOAT. Another man carries a violin case. Koscik hands Tuvia another bottle of vodka. TUVIA Those men? They were the ones who killed my parents? GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 15. 29 CONTINUED: 29 Koscik doesn't want to tell him. Finally he nods, yes. KOSCIK You people. Why is it so fucking hard to be friends with a Jew? They embrace. TUVIA Imagine being one. Tuvia leads his motley band toward the woods. CUT TO: 30 A FOREST TRAIL - DAY 30 Tuvia leads them. He notices an OLD MAN staring at him. OLD MAN You sat in back. Tuvia just looks at him. OLD MAN (CONT'D) In school. I am Shimon H'aretz. TUVIA I thought you were dead. SHIMON I am at least half-dead. I heard them speaking of your parents. I am very sorry. Tuvia shakes his head. SHIMON (CONT'D) And the other brothers? What was his name, the wild one? TUVIA Zus. He's with the other two. SHIMON You are hiding here? In the forest? Tuvia nods. SHIMON (CONT'D) There has been trouble before maybe? With the police? Tuvia doesn't answer. DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 16. 30 CONTINUED: 30 SHIMON (CONT'D) So now you go to the forest. A wise choice. TUVIA For a dumb schoolboy, you mean. SHIMON My whole life I presumed to teach others the right way to live. I had no doubt: this is God's way, this isn't. You'll forgive me if recent events have somewhat shaken my resolve. TUVIA It is just like school, I don't know what you're talking about. Teacher...Come... Come. (gesturing to the FOLLOWERS) Please. CUT TO: 31 OMITTED 31 32 THE CLEARING - LATER THAT DAY 32 The new arrivals squat by a fire where potatoes are cooking in the ashes. Everyone shares from the soup pot. There aren't enough spoons to go around. Shimon offers Aron something to eat. SHIMON Here... You're not hungry? Aron doesn't respond. SHIMON (CONT'D) The little one does not talk? ASAEL He saw. Things. TUVIA, MEANWHILE stares fixedly as Avram digs his daughter's grave. The gun is still in his belt. Zus is constructing a shelter. ZUS I send you for food and you bring more mouths to feed. TUVIA You send me? ZUS Did you at least get the gun? DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 16A. 32 CONTINUED: 32 Tuvia shows him. TUVIA Only four bullets. ZUS Then we'll have to make them count. Zus heads for the food. Asael is trying to start a fire but the kindling is wet. SHIMON Here... Shimon takes a book from his coat, rips out pages covered in Hebrew and crumples them into the fire. They burst into flame. SHIMON (CONT'D) The Psalms have many uses. ZUS SITS AMONG THE NEWCOMERS watching as they eat hungrily. Tuvia stops near Avram DIGGING a grave before heading out of the camp. We realize Avram's daughter has died while Tuvia was away. THE SOUND OF DISTANT THUNDER. DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 17. 33 A LONE FARMHOUSE - DUSK 33 Tuvia stands in the driving rain, shaking. He stares at the lit windows. 34 INSIDE THE HOUSE 34 The POLICE CAPTAIN we saw earlier eats dinner with his WIFE and TWO SONS. They speak in Russian. WIFE You worked late. The man nods, his mouth full of food. WIFE (CONT'D) Tomorrow is Sunday. You have a day off, yes? POLICE CAPTAIN ...Fucking SS never sleeps... The door OPENS slowly. They all look up. YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 18. 34 CONTINUED: 34 Tuvia stands on the threshold, dripping wet, a spectral figure. He holds the pistol at his side. TUVIA You know who I am? The policeman says nothing. His wife is instantly terrified. One of the SONS stands. Tuvia turns the gun on him. TUVIA (CONT'D) Sit. The son obeys. The SOUND of the rain on the tin roof is deafening. Tuvia turns back to the Police Captain. TUVIA (CONT'D) And you know why I am here. POLICE CAPTAIN ...what are you talking about? TUVIA You have no idea what I'm talking about... POLICE CAPTAIN If they say find someone, I find him. It's my job. TUVIA To find Jews. POLICE CAPTAIN Or lose my job. TUVIA And it's a good job, isn't it? You like your job. POLICEMAN I was always fair with your family. ...Everyone knew you were smuggling this and that. But I looked the other way. ...Ask your father. TUVIA My father? You don't talk about my father... Tuvia places the pistol against the man's forehead. TUVIA (CONT'D) Down on your knees. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 19. 34 CONTINUED: (2) 34 TUVIA (CONT'D) ON...YOUR...KNEES...PIG! The policeman begins to weep. TUVIA (CONT'D) For my parents, David and Beila Bielski... for my brothers and all the others-- POLICE CAPTAIN Please.... I beg you... One of the man's SONS makes a move toward Tuvia. Tuvia SHOOTS him in the chest. His mother SCREAMS. The Policeman suddenly starts to stand. Tuvia backs away, shoots him. And then the other son. It is all over in seconds. 35 OMITTED 35 36 TUVIA STANDS THERE, FROZEN 36 The police captain's wife is prostrate and KEENING over her dead family in Russian. WIFE Kill me, too! Tuvia should indeed kill her, too. To avoid being identified. TUVIA Tell them who did this. CUT TO: 36A EXT. POLICE CAPTAIN'S HOUSE - DUSK 36A The rain still pours down on the house as Tuvia runs away. 37 A FOREST TRAIL - STILL RAINING 37 Tuvia pushes through dense forest. Branches rake his face. Finally he leans against a tree. We move CLOSE on his face. TUVIA Riboynoy shel oylam, riboynoy shel oylam... Lord of the universe, forgive me, I have murdered -- but they were monsters and did not deserve to live. DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 20. 38 NEXT MORNING - A LOW FOG CLINGS TO THE FOREST FLOOR 38 Zus awakens, sodden and stiff. He looks at the group, now numbering fourteen. People sleep huddled together: Asael holds Aron; Avram keeps his surviving daughter close. And there is Tuvia -- sitting by the fire. Zus takes the pistol from Tuvia's belt. Checks the cylinder. ZUS Only one bullet left. TUVIA His sons. Zus nods his approval. ZUS How was it? TUVIA What? ZUS To kill them. It was good, no? TUVIA Shut up. Tuvia stares into the fire. He is dirty and tired. Zus looks around. ZUS What are we going to do with these others? TUVIA I don't know-- ZUS The women will slow us down. And your old teacher-- TUVIA You're afraid he's going to beat you for forgetting your homework. ZUS We have to be able to keep moving, and quickly. TUVIA I agree. But they're here. They consider their predicament. DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 21. 38 CONTINUED: 38 TUVIA (CONT'D) We'll sleep farther up the trail. If anyone comes, they'll find them first. The gunshots will give us time to escape. ZUS Alright. But no more. TUVIA No more. CUT TO: 39 SEVERAL MORE REFUGEES 39 stumbling into camp behind Tuvia, who carries a heavy sack of provisions. Zus gives Tuvia a look. TUVIA I know. I know... Tamara, you remember Cousin Zus. Please, go sit down by the fire. And this is Lazar -- Isabel's youngest... Tamara is pleasant-looking but emotionally wounded. TUVIA (CONT'D) This is Isaac Malbin. From Minsk. Malbin is sweet-faced with little round Trotsky glasses. TUVIA (CONT'D) Asael, find them something to eat. ASAEL! Zus takes Tuvia aside. ZUS Tuvia, I have pity for them all, BUT-- TUVIA They are family. ZUS And how will we feed this family? TUVIA We'll water the soup. One of the new arrivals is a DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY. Tuvia and Zus watch her pass. Zus is particularly interested. ZUS And this one, is she family? TUVIA No. By the fire, the veterans pepper the newcomers with DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 A21. 39 CONTINUED: 39 questions. DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 21A. 39 CONTINUED: (2) 39 MIRIAM You are from Lida! Is Isadore Korein alive? LOVA There are so many in the ghetto, I don't know... TAMARA Does anyone have news from Vilna? DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 22. 40 OMITTED 40 40A ANOTHER DAY (CAMP #1) 40A Food, such as it is, is being handed out to SEVERAL NEW ARRIVALS. Asael brushes Aron's hair. Rachel sits beside her grieving father. She looks at Aron. He looks back. Nearby, Tuvia and Malbin are building a shelter. Malbin is hopelessly inept. A wall COLLAPSES. TUVIA Fuck me! Have you never used a hammer? MALBIN Uh. No. TUVIA What is it you do, then? MALBIN I suppose...you'd have to say...I was...am...an intellectual. TUVIA This is a job? MALBIN I published a small magazine... actually a journal...well, more like a pamphlet. Zus passes them, his arm around the dark-haired beauty. ZUS Tuvia, this is Rona. Rona is my forest wife. TUVIA I see. Congratulations. Zus winks and walks past. Malbin and Tuvia watch them. MALBIN Interesting concept. TUVIA As long as his village wife stays in hiding. MALBIN Nice to know there are some things even Hitler can't destroy. DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 23. 40A CONTINUED: 40A Suddenly the camp grows quiet. TWO YOUNG MEN who have emerged from the forest, their clothes dirty and torn. One of them aims an army-issue rifle. ZUS Hello, boys, what can we do for you? YOUNG MAN #1 Food. We want food. Everyone remains still. Zus eyes his own rifle nearby. ZUS These little shits are holding us up. The Young Man motions his partner to take Zus's rifle. ZUS (CONT'D) You little shits have the balls to shoot me? In response, the young man CHAMBERS A ROUND. TUVIA This is all the food we have. You are welcome to share. ZUS No. YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 23A. 40A CONTINUED: (2) 40A ZUS (CONT'D) I want to see if this little shit will shoot me. You like shooting Jews, you little shit? YOUNG MAN #1 You are Jews? GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 24. 40A CONTINUED: (3) 40A ZUS No. We're the Gestapo, you little shit. TUVIA Come. Sit. Put down your guns. ZUS Or perhaps you'd prefer I shove them up your ass. TUVIA Where are you from? The young man glares at Zus. Then, to Tuvia: YOUNG MAN #1 Horodyszcze. The name freezes Zus in his tracks. His wife is there. PERETZ We haven't eaten in two days. My name is Peretz, this is Jacov. JACOV Two days ago there were three thousand Jews in Horodyszcze. Now there are fifty. Me and him, we hid in a wall. ZUS You know a woman there, Sonia Bielski? The men look at one another. JACOV We knew her. Zus can hardly bring himself to ask the next question. ZUS ...There was a child. Jacov shakes his head. Sorry. Zus leans his head against a tree. After a moment he begins to BEAT HIS HEAD against it until BLOOD pours down his face. ASAEL His family. Tuvia puts his arms around his brother. Zus's shoulders begin to heave. Soon his body convulses with deep wracking sobs. He is absolutely unself-conscious in his grief. GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 25. 40A CONTINUED: (4) 40A ZUS So many dead. TUVIA I know. ZUS Mama. Papa. Their heads are close together, their faces wet with tears. ZUS (CONT'D) Why not us? TUVIA I don't know. ZUS I thought they'd be safe. I should have been with them. TUVIA No. ZUS I could have protected them. Tuvia just holds him. He, too, is crying quietly. ZUS (CONT'D) Better to be rabbits? Hunted? Hiding? No... Zus breaks free of Tuvia's embrace and walks away. 41 LATER - BY THE FIRE 41 Jacov and Peretz are eating. Between ravenous bites-- PERETZ We are looking for partisans. JACOV What is the name of your otriad? Tuvia laughs ruefully. ASAEL What is an 'otriad?' TUVIA An armed brigade. JACOV We heard the Russians are beginning to organize. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 26. 41 CONTINUED: 41 TUVIA Here? JACOV And also in the Lipicanska. ASAEL Then we are the Bielski Otriad. You want to join? PERETZ The Russians are fighters. JACOV --But you need a gun to join them. Without a gun you are nothing. They sabotage railroads and kill Germans. ZUS (O.S.) We will kill all the Germans you can handle. Starting tonight. They stare up at him, his face a mask of blood and filth. ZUS (CONT'D) If you're not afraid to use that rifle. 42 MOMENTS LATER - JUST OUTSIDE OF CAMP -- 42 Zus is loading Wilencki's gun. TUVIA --we must get what we need without killing. We can't make more enemies-- Zus concentrates on opening the breach. TUVIA (CONT'D) --It won't bring your family back to life. Or Mama. Or Papa. ZUS Blood for blood. You had your revenge. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 27. 42 CONTINUED: 42 TUVIA And I can still see their faces. ZUS 'Vengeance is mine.' Who said that? TUVIA So this is God's work you're doing, Zussie? ZUS No. Only YOU can play God. Save a few lives, take a few others... TUVIA We cannot become...like them. ZUS If only... Are you coming with us or not? TUVIA Us? ZUS Peretz and Jacov. Asael, too. Tuvia looks over at Asael, who looks away. TUVIA You are making the decisions now? A stand-off. Zus stares back at him. The struggle for command has grown more obvious. TUVIA (CONT'D) We wait for dark. CUT TO: 43 A BURNING TRUCK 43 Lights up the night sky. A MAN comes running out of a tavern, the same man who loaded Jews onto trucks in an earlier scene. MAN My truck! WHO DID THIS TO MY TRUCK? Tuvia, Zus and the others appear out the shadows. TUVIA We did. GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 28. 43 CONTINUED: 43 The man stops short at the sight of their weapons. MAN Who are you? You don't understand. They made me give them my truck... Zus FIRES. Jacov and Peretz follow suit. The man goes down. They throw his DEAD BODY onto the burning truck. CUT TO: 43A A CLUSTER OF HOUSES - LATER THAT NIGHT 43A Zus and Peretz are backing out of an open doorway, FIRING BACK INSIDE AS THEY GO. From within, the sound of SCREAMS. ZUS THIS IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU COOPERATE WITH NAZI SCUM..! FACES appear furtively at the windows of nearby houses. Zus addresses the little neighborhood, delirious with joy. ZUS (CONT'D) WE ARE THE BIELSKI OTRIAD! WE ARE JEWS! YOU LIKE TO KILL JEWS! HERE WE ARE! WE ARE THE BIELSKI'S! TELL THEM! Tuvia looks around warily. This is getting out of hand. CUT TO: 44 A ROADSIDE DITCH - LATER THAT NIGHT 44 Tuvia and Asael lie in on one side of a road. Tuvia has looped ONE END OF THE WIRE around a post. 45 IN THE DITCH ON THE OTHER SIDE 45 Zus, Peretz, and Jacov WRAP THE WIRE to a tree. 46 UP AHEAD 46 The lights of a MOTORCYCLE, a GERMAN COURIER. 47 IN THE DITCH 47 Tuvia waits until the BIKE is almost upon them. Then he TIGHTENS the WIRE so it stretches INVISIBLY ACROSS THE ROAD. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 29. 48 THE MOTORCYCLIST IS GARROTED 48 by the wire. His bike goes sliding away as the Bielski's swarm him, KILLING HIM with the last bullet from the Mahkarov. ZUS rummages through the downed-bike's saddlebags. He finds a beautiful KNIFE and lifts it up triumphantly. PERETZ Look--! MORE HEADLIGHTS fast approaching. TUVIA Hide! Everyone! They all scramble back into the ditch, dragging the dead courier with them. 49 A GERMAN STAFF CAR 49 approaches. As its headlights pick up the downed motorcycle, it slows and pulls off to the side -- 50 DIRECTLY OVER THE DITCH 50 Where Tuvia and Zus are concealed. From within the car, we hear VOICES SPEAKING GERMAN. A YOUNG PRIVATE gets out and walks up the road to investigate. PRIVATE It's one of ours, but no one is here. Maybe he was drunk? From the car, an SERGEANT yells a reply. SERGEANT Move it off the road before the convoy passes. I'll report the sonuvabitch. As the soldier drags the bike off the road, AN OFFICER steps out of the car and lights a cigarette. He's followed by the Sergeant. He carries a Schmeisser SUBMACHINE GUN dangling from his shoulder. 51 IN THE DITCH - ZUS 51 can see the Sergeant's feet peeking out over the ditch. A STREAM OF PISS Cascades onto him. He tries to inch his body away... GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 30. 51 CONTINUED: 51 THE PISSING SERGEANT catches the flicker of MOVEMENT below, SEES Zus lying in the ditch. Stunned, he tries to zip up his fly. It catches. ZUS LEAPS UP brandishing the KNIFE. He's on the Sergeant before he can get the gun off his shoulder. Stabbing him through his greatcoat, the BLADE BREAKS OFF IN HIS HAND. MEANWHILE, THE LIEUTENANT drops his cigarette, reaching under his coat for a pistol. Tuvia TACKLES him. The GUN skids away. They roll around on the road, CLAWING, PUNCHING, BITING. Tuvia SLAMS the man's head against the pavement. 52 UP THE ROAD 52 The Private sees Asael and Peretz coming at him. Jacov follows with his rifle. The Private turns and runs down the road. They give chase. 53 FROM INSIDE THE CAR 53 Another OFFICER is in the back seat with A WOMAN. He reaches for his gun, stands up in the seat and begins FIRING WILDLY at Tuvia. TUVIA ROLLS UNDER THE CAR, avoiding the burst. MEANWHILE, ZUS USES THE HANDLE OF THE KNIFE to BREAK the Sergeant's nose. He RIPS the SCHMEISSER away, firing point- blank into the man, whose greatcoat CATCHES FIRE. INSIDE THE STAFF CAR The officer takes close aim at Tuvia, just as ZUS TURNS THE MACHINE GUN on the car BLOWING OUT THE WINDOWS, killing the Officer and the woman -- and saving his brother's life. 54 MEANWHILE, DOWN THE ROAD 54 Jacov fires at the Private, MISSES. The man keeps RUNNING. Jacov fires again. MISSES AGAIN. FINALLY his THIRD SHOT hits him in the leg. The Private keeps running. Limping now. JACOV I got him! Peretz and Asael can now catch up to the soldier. FROM FAR AWAY We SEE them knock the Private to the ground, KICKING him until Jacov catches up to them and FIRES A FINAL SHOT. GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 31. 55 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 55 Tuvia stands, out of breath. TUVIA Stupid! The gunfire could be heard for miles. ZUS He was pissing on my head. Zus is high from the killing, covered in the dead man's blood. He begins calling out orders. ZUS (CONT'D) Peretz, Jacov, check the car for guns... This one's yours. He presents him with the Schmeisser as if it were a trophy. Tuvia accepts it, checking the gun efficiently. ZUS (CONT'D) I'll check his pockets for more ammo. TUVIA Hurry--! AT THE STAFF CAR Peretz and Jacov emerge with two MACHINE-PISTOLS, several BOTTLES OF SCHNAPPS and a beautiful LEICA CAMERA. JACOV They were on their way to a party! They toss one bottle to Zus and another to Tuvia. 56 UP THE ROAD 56 Asael stands over the dead Private. He isn't much older than Aron. 57 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 57 ZUS rifles the pockets of the dead Sergeant for ammo. He finds cigarettes and the man's wallet. He opens it. ZUS Welcome to Belarus, herr Henkel. A CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS as Peretz and Jacov toast their victory. PERETZ Now we are real Partisans... GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 32. 57 CONTINUED: 57 JACOV To the Bielski Otriad! 58 SUDDENLY - ANOTHER SET OF HEADLIGHTS 58 are rounding the bend. Troop trucks. The Staff Car was leading A CONVOY. TUVIA Into the fields! RUN! Tuvia pulls Peretz off the road, but Jacov reloads his rifle and begins to FIRE at the approaching trucks. TUVIA (CONT'D) Jacov, NO! THE TRUCKS STOP. Troops pour off and begin RETURNING FIRE. Jacov is CUT DOWN by a MACHINE GUN. Peretz, Zus, and Tuvia race into the WHEAT FIELD. It's not clear if they can make it into the woods. A FLARE IGNITES OVERHEAD turning the wheat fields BRIGHT WHITE in flickering incandescence. Malbin is almost paralytic with fear. ASAEL doesn't know which way to run. He plunges into the WHEAT FIELD...but ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD. ONE OF THE TRUCKS drives forward, CUTTING HIM OFF, using its SPOTLIGHT to reveal him. FIFTEEN SOLDIERS start after him. 59 SEEN FROM ABOVE 59 We watch as they CONVERGE on him. TUVIA, ZUS AND PERETZ Have almost made it into the woods when PERETZ IS HIT. He falls. Tuvia and Zus pick him up and half-carry, half-drag him into the sanctuary of the forest. TUVIA Zus. His rifle. Zus races back to pick up Peretz's weapon. 60 ASAEL, MEANWHILE 60 has realized his mistake. He tries to circle back toward the woods but the SOLDIERS move to CUT HIM OFF. He is fast, but not fast enough. We realize he isn't going to make it. 61 IN THE WOODS 61 Tuvia and Zus look at the scene with mounting horror. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 33. 61 CONTINUED: 61 TUVIA Asael... He rips the rifle from Zus's hands. For a moment we think he's going to go back after him. Instead, he wedges the rifle into a tree-trunk and takes careful aim... THE SPOTLIGHT SHATTERS Plunging the field into darkness as the flare burns out. ASAEL seizes the moment and dives to his knees, disappearing from view and CRAWLING NOW rather than expose himself. AN IRRIGATION DITCH is nearby. Frantically he DIGS into the soft mud on its banks. As he scrapes his hands raw, he can HEAR his pursuers drawing near, CALLING OUT to one another. CUT TO: 62 THE FOREST CAMP - DAWN 62 A somber mood. Tuvia watches someone scrape at the porridge congealed in an empty pot. OTHERS stare listlessly into space. ONE MAN chews on a piece of leather, ANOTHER sucks on an old chicken bone. Zus, meanwhile, is in the middle of a nasty drunk from the captured schnapps. Nearby, Aron shares his ration of bread with Rachel. Little enough, but a connection is made. Peretz lies nearby. Malbin is trying to comforts him. There is nothing that can help him. Malbin looks to Tuvia. SHIMON They thought you were bringing food. Tuvia just stares at him. SHIMON (CONT'D) Did the farmers stop you? Still no answer from Tuvia. SHIMON (CONT'D) They had guns? Dogs? TUVIA No. SHIMON I don't understand. Tuvia says nothing. Nearby, a child cries in hunger. SHIMON (CONT'D) The Talmud says if you save a life you must take responsibility for it. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 34-34A. 62 CONTINUED: 62 TUVIA Again I have no idea what you are talking about. Around them, the beseeching eyes of so many hungry faces. SHIMON I think you do. VOICE You are the Bielski's? A MAN stands in the clearing. BEN ZION GULKOWITZ is tall, well muscled, a rifle strapped over his shoulder. ZUS How'd you get past the Lazar? BEN ZION Who? Zus stands unsteadily, then lurches into the woods, leaning on an occasional tree for support. He finds the erstwhile sentry --LAZAR -- ambling toward him. ZUS You shit! You worthless shit! Zus punches him, knocking him the ground. In a sloppy, drunken frenzy, Zus SLAPS him again. TUVIA Enough! ZUS He walked right by you! Someone could have been killed! Tuvia pulls Zus off him. TUVIA I said, enough! Get up! Get up! ZUS If we were real partisans he'd be shot. TUVIA He made a mistake! DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 35. 62 CONTINUED: (3) 62 ZUS MISTAKE! We cannot make mistakes! As Zus goes for Lazar again, Tuvia roughly PULLS HIM OFF. Zus goes flying, tripping over, landing on his ass. TUVIA That's right, Zus. No mistakes. Like last night. First they will torture Asael...and then they will hang him. Tuvia walks away, leaving his brother on the ground. 63 BACK IN CAMP 63 Tuvia rejoins them. Ben Zion looks up at him. BEN ZION You are Tuvia Bielski. TUVIA You know me? BEN ZION I am Ben Zion Gulkowitz. Ben Zion is besieged by questions about friends and family. MIRIAM Pardon me, you are from Vilna. My sister lives on Passaya Street. BEN ZION The SD came without warning. Hundreds were taken. No one knows where. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 36. 63 CONTINUED: 63 THE WOMAN begins to cry. MIRIAM My poor sister...dear God, no... Meanwhile, Peretz's MOANING ceases. A woman grumbles: WOMAN #1 We'd be better off in the ghetto... TAMARA At least here we are safe. LOVA There at least we had hope... SHIMON No. Here, we have hope. A FEW MORE join in, grumbling their dissatisfaction. Others take the opposite position. These are Jews, after all, and arguing is a revered sport and a pastime. It escalates. WOMAN #1 We are hungry! This is a defining moment for Tuvia. When at first he speaks, it is awkward, ineffectual amid the growing tumult. TUVIA I know we have no food. But tomorrow... tomorrow will be another mission. RONA Look what happened the last time. TUVIA That was a mistake! But the mistakes we made will not be made again! More objections. Tuvia must raise his voice to be heard. TUVIA (CONT'D) We could be here a long time. And we have to prepare. LOVA How? TUVIA Better security. Better at getting food and information-- (talking over their OBJECTIONS) --at making shelters. Whatever is needed. We all participate. We don't work against each other. At this he looks directly at Zus. Daring him to object. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 36A. 63 CONTINUED: (2) 63 TUVIA (CONT'D) I want to kill Nazis, too, but we...just...cannot afford revenge. Not right now. We cannot afford to lose friends like Jacov and Peretz. A small voice speaks up. ARON Or Asael. Everyone stares. It is the first time Aron has spoken. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 37. 63 CONTINUED: (3) 63 TUVIA Or Asael. We... We-- (trying to hold it TOGETHER) --cannot lose anyone. He looks from face to face. Filthy, ravaged, many of them with tears in their eyes. This is what they need -- leadership, faith, something to believe in. And gradually, his tentativeness and awkwardness is replaced by something else. A new voice. From deep inside. TUVIA (CONT'D) ...We will map out where we've been so as to not visit the same farms too often. And we take only from those who can afford to give, and leave those who can't alone. LOVA The poorest farmer has more than us. TUVIA True. But what I am saying is... what I mean is... We are not thieves. (his resolve growing with every word) Or murderers. We may be hunted like animals but we will not become animals. We have all chosen this -- to live free, like human beings, for as long as we can. Each day of freedom is an act of faith. And if we die trying to live, at least we die like human beings. His mission statement. A vision of their future. Everyone nods in mute acknowledgement. Zus lowers his head. The shift in power between them has occurred. Tuvia has emerged as the undisputed leader. CUT TO: 64 OMITTED 64 64A FALL IN THE FOREST 64A The trees take on color as if in celebration of their coming together. 65 KOSCIK'S FARM 65 All is quiet as Tuvia, Zus and Ben Zion watch from the woods. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 38. 65 CONTINUED: 65 TUVIA Now. They leave their cover and approach warily, guns at the ready. 66 OUTSIDE THE HOUSE 66 Koscik's wife looks up from her garden and glares at them. TUVIA Hello. She refuses to be flattered. In Russian: KOSCIK'S WIFE In the barn. 67 IN THE BARN 67 Zus calls out. ZUS Koscik, put your pants back on and leave those sheep alone. He steps into the shadows to find: KOSCIK HANGING FROM A THRESHING HOOK that has been driven through his chest. A sign attached to the hook reads (in Polish) \"JEW LOVER.\" CUT TO: 68 KOSCIK'S NEWLY-DUG GRAVE 68 is just beyond the barn. Tuvia finishes piling on the last shovelful of earth. Koscik's wife stares straight ahead. TUVIA I'm sorry. KOSCIK'S WIFE Come. 69 A ROOT CELLAR 69 dug into a hillside. Overgrown with tall grass it is undetectable. Koscik's wife opens the heavy door, revealing ASAEL, who emerges blinking into the bright light. TUVIA Thank God. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 39. 69 CONTINUED: 69 Zus pulls his lost brother into a mighty embrace. ASAEL Zus.... ZUSSIE... I can't breathe. Zus lets him go and Asael reaches back into the root cellar. ASAEL (CONT'D) Look. Two LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN -- BELLA and CHAYA -- emerge, tentative and scared. Though their dresses are dirty, it is obvious they were once expensive. Zus eyes them appreciatively. ZUS Asael... Well, well.. ASAEL Shut up. Look at this-- He has two more rifles and a large box of ammunition. Tuvia turns to Koscik's wife, deeply moved. TUVIA Thank you. KOSCIK'S WIFE Go. CUT TO: 70 A FOREST TRAIL 70 They head for home. Zus walks beside Bella. BELLA --and then we fell into this horrible bog. Chaya saved me. Honestly, I can't swim at all. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 40. 70 CONTINUED: 70 ZUS Then I will teach you! BELLA We must have got lost a dozen times. I was absolutely resigned to die. ZUS No... BELLA Tell him, Chaya. Was it not the absolute worst? And that farmer, Mr. Koscik, kept making the most vulgar jokes, he said any girl who-- As they continue out of earshot, it appears as though Zus would be happy to listen for hours. DISSOLVE TO: 71 A TOWERING PINE FOREST 71 Aron and Rachel are walking through the woods. For a brief moment, viewed through the eyes of the young, we see these woods as a magical place. Strange mushrooms, gnarled roots, an enormous spider's web glistening with dew. 72 THE CAMP HAS BEGUN TO SHOW PROGRESS 72 Sentries are posted. Zus expertly helps with the building a bunker (\"zemylanka\"). There's a more permanent kitchen, a wash trough, a clothesline. Pinchas tends his goat. Though primitive and raw...a haven. SHIMON AND MALBIN ARE DIGGING A HOLE Their bickering will become for them, as time goes on, a sport and a pastime. MALBIN You're trying to tell me all politics is meaningless. SHIMON In the West a monster with a little mustache, in the East a monster with a big mustache. This is all I need to know about politics. MALBIN Your messiah will have a mustache, too, and a full beard. SHIMON No. The messiahs are all in politics, and they're killing us. Zus unloads two cut and stripped trees. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 40A. 72 CONTINUED: 72 ZUS What's killing me is all your talking. Back to work. Malbin and Shimon go back to work. MALBIN And Roosevelt? He has no mustache. SHIMON My life in these woods is much easier because of Mr. Roosevelt, thank you. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 41. 73 WALKING THROUGH THE CAMP TUVIA AND ASAEL 73 review their plans. TUVIA We need to know what's going on in the villages, how the Germans patrol, who the informers are-- He realizes that Asael is not fully concentrating; instead he is watching as Chaya walks past. TUVIA (CONT'D) Are you listening to me? ASAEL Yes. TUVIA What's her name? ASAEL Chaya. [I believe.] TUVIA CHAYA! He waves as Chaya turns to look in their direction. Asael smiles, embarrassed. TUVIA (CONT'D) So talk to her. ASAEL I hardly know her. TUVIA You spent three days in a cellar! Asael blushes, returns the focus to their prior conversation. ASAEL Malbin says the Piznarksi granary is full. We need two guns at least... TUVIA Whose turn to go? ASAEL Zus. TUVIA You go along, just to make sure he understands my orders. Asael nods. TUVIA (CONT'D) Go on...Go! DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 A41-41A. 73 CONTINUED: 73 Asael heads toward Chaya. 74 NEAR A SHED ROOF - BEN ZION 74 We notice a FEW NEW FACES. Their number has exceeded twenty. Among them are two lumbering, dark-skinned men, ARKADY and MOTL LUBCZANSKI. Ben Zion is showing Lazar and the other newcomers how to clean a weapon. BEN ZION This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword. You fix the patch to the rod-- They do as he instructs. BEN ZION (CONT'D) --then run it through the barrel... and don't lose the patch in the BARREL-- Lazar looks up, sheepishly. LAZAR I lost my patch. ARKADY LUBCZANSKI whispers contemptuously to his brother, MOTL... ARKADY LUBCZANSKI The village idiot. Zus shoves Arkady out of the way and approaches Lazar, who cowers. But rather than abuse him, Zus removes the patch from the rifle and hands it back to him. LAZAR Thank you, Zus. ZUS It's nothing. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 42. 75 OMITTED 75 76 A ROADSIDE - NEXT DAY 76 KISSELY is a MILKMAN with bright red hair and a bushy mustache. He leads a horse-drawn CART laden with milk cans. ZUS AND THE OTHERS rise up out of the ditch. In Russian: ZUS Good morning, friend. Getting an early start to market? Could you possibly spare us a bit of milk? Zus' tone is belied by the rifle in his hand. KISSELY This is what I'm required to give the Germans. If I don't meet my quota they'll shoot me and my family. Zus is tempted to shoot him himself. ASAEL Leave half. He can't go to the Germans empty-handed. Zus glares at Asael. ASAEL (CONT'D) Tuvia's orders. Zus shakes his head, climbs onto the wagon and begins removing cartons. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 43. 76 CONTINUED: 76 ZUS We are so grateful, comrade, for your cooperation. What a lovely coat. Is that a fur collar? CUT TO: 77 ZUS, NOW WEARING THE MILKMAN'S COAT 77 joins the others lugging milk cans along the forest path. LAZAR (V.O.) HALT! WHO GOES THERE! Zus shakes his head. Lazar stands, pointing his weapon. ZUS Lazar, you can see it's us, you idiot. You only ask, 'who goes there' when you don't know who it is. LAZAR Sorry, Zus. 78 THE CAMP 78 is a beehive of activity. Shimon and Malbin are digging. MALBIN Even Spinoza said existence can be substantiated by empirical evidence. SHIMON All your secular learning, yet you know nothing of life. MALBIN How can you say this? Learning is my life. SHIMON And for every fact that goes in your head, another comes out your rear end. CHAYA and BELLA receive the bounty from the foragers. BELLA Milk, eggs -- Chaya, our brave men have brought us a feast! ZUS Blintzes! You will make me blintzes! She bestows her best smile upon him. 79 BY THE FIRE 79 New arrivals are being shown around by Ben Zion. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 43A. 79 CONTINUED: 79 A MAN and WOMAN cry out with joy at an unexpected reunion. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 44. 79 CONTINUED: (2) 79 ARKADY LUBCZANSKi approaches Chaya. ARKADY I don't think we've been properly introduced. Arkady Lubczanski. CHAYA Hello. ARKADY You are Chaya? CHAYA ...Yes. ARKADY You are getting along all right? Anything you need? An extra blanket? CHAYA Oh. Well... Yes, that would be nice. ARKADY You'll have it by tonight. Something nice and soft. I couldn't help but notice you don't have a husband yet. CHAYA Yet? CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 44A. 79 CONTINUED: (3) 79 ARKADY Most of the woman have already chosen. They haven't told you about this? DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 45. 79 CONTINUED: (4) 79 CHAYA No. But thank you for explaining it. She hurries away. Malbin sits down wearily beside Shimon. MALBIN Descartes at least provided for the subjective nature of experience. He takes a spoon from his sock. SHIMON Yes. You annoy me therefore I exist. MALBIN You are not eating? SHIMON By my best calculation, today is High Holiday. I am fasting. Malbin can't believe this. He rolls his eyes and digs in. One of the NEWCOMERS has brought a violin. He begins to play. A bittersweet melody. People stop talking and listen, eyes filling at this reminder of a sweeter, civilized time. Ben Zion has left the new arrivals and approached Tuvia. He looks grave. Tuvia immediately knows something is wrong. TUVIA What is it? BEN ZION The new ones, they are from Novagroduk. Your wife-- Tuvia tenses. Ben Zion hesitates... BEN ZION (CONT'D) They say...She was killed last week. I'm sorry. Tuvia nods. No outward display of grief. An awkward moment. TUVIA Thank you for telling me. We have to dig a trench around the new zemylanka. If it rains I'm afraid water will seep in. Tuvia clearly cannot deal with his news. BEN ZION I'll see to it, then. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 46. 79 CONTINUED: (5) 79 Tuvia nods and walks away. CUT TO: 80 ARON AND RACHEL WALK THROUGH THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS 80 Cathedral light cuts through the trees forming visible shafts. ARON Jacob's ladders. Like in his dream. Asael says you can see the angels. They walk on, eventually coming upon RAILROAD TRACKS. A TRAIN is rounding the bend, headed in their direction. RACHEL Can we stay to watch? ARON If we hide. They move back into the trees as the train NEARS: a slow- moving engine pulling a line of WOODEN CATTLE CARS. RACHEL Is that a Nazi train? ARON If we had some dynamite we could blow the shit out of it. RACHEL (with undisguised AWE) ...Just like your brothers. Aron can't help but be pleased by this notion. Then, as the train passes, they can see HANDS gripping the small barred windows. And every now and then a gaunt, desperate FACE. They stare in astonishment. CUT TO: 81 OMITTED 81 SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 47. 81A UNDER A SHELTER -- CONTINUOUS 81A Tuvia sits alone. Outside, the SOUND of the violin continues. Shimon comes to sit beside him. SHIMON I am sorry for your loss. Tuvia nods. He is deep inside himself. SHIMON (CONT'D) Do you want to say the Kaddish? When at last Tuvia speaks, it is almost to himself. TUVIA She was a beautiful woman. But cold. Not a day went by she didn't remind me I wasn't a good provider. For years it wasn't really a marriage at all. And now... He lowers his head. All Shimon can do is sit beside him. 82 THE PERIMETER OF THE CAMP - CONTINUOUS 82 Bella takes Chaya aside. BELLA You have lipstick? Please, I know you have some left. Chaya digs in her pocket and produces a tiny remnant. Bella dabs it on and casually approaches Zus, who is on guard duty. BELLA (O.S.) (CONT'D) May I join you? ZUS Of course. BELLA You get lonely out here? ZUS I like the woods. LAUGHTER and MUSIC waft through the trees. BELLA I'm a little scared out here. Zus knows an opportunity when he sees one. He offers her a drink from his bottle of vodka. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 48. 82 CONTINUED: 82 BELLA (CONT'D) I've never tried it. ZUS Go ahead. She drinks, refuses to grimace. Drinks again. Zus laughs. - Bella touches the rifle in his arms. BELLA Why is there a rule against women having guns? ZUS There aren't enough for the men. BELLA Women need guns, too. ZUS What for? BELLA For protection. ZUS Women have men for protection. Bella bites her lip. She's a virgin but also realistic. BELLA I want protection. She steps closer and takes Zus's hand...under her coat...onto her breast...never taking her eyes off him. BELLA (CONT'D) You will take good care of me? You will be my commander. 83 OMITTED 83 84 MEANWHILE - DEEP IN THE FOREST 84 Aron and Rachel are walking back from the train tracks. Suddenly he senses movement, freezes: ARMED POLICEMEN are advancing through the trees. Aron and Rachel bury themselves beneath piles of leaves until the police pass by, then he grabs her hand and dashes OFF-- ARON RUNS through the woods like a deer. She follows. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 49. 85 IN THE CAMP 85 He bursts in, SCREAMING. ARON MEN WITH GUNS! Chaos. People panic, search for family members, grab whatever they can carry, ZUS AND BELLA emerge from the woods where they have lain together for the first time. He grabs his rifle. TUVIA tries to maintain order. TUVIA ONLY FOOD AND GUNS! FOLLOW ASAEL! Asael clutches Chaya's hand. Rounding up others. ASAEL Don't panic. THIS WAY!. GO. ZUS QUIET! NOT ANOTHER WORD!!! THE POLICEMEN begin FIRING. TWO of the group are KILLED. Tuvia roughly pushes people deeper into the woods. TUVIA Lova, Ben Zion -- stay with us. Asael, keep them moving. Don't stop! THE POLICEMEN enter the camp. A submachine gun RAKES a shelter. KISSELY has found the escape trail into the woods. KISSELY This way-- 86 THE FOREST IS DEATHLY STILL 86 Tuvia and Zus usher the group across the river and up the embankment. TUVIA Go! Go! Move! Isaac, keep them moving! Zus, Asael, Ben Zion... Tuvia motions for them to take defensive positions while the others escape.- The policemen emerge hurriedly through the trees and begin crossing the river. SHOTS rings out. A Policeman goes down. The German Soldier is shot in the leg. They are dragged from the water. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 49A. 86 CONTINUED: 86 An edgy silence. From the trees a VOICE calls out in Russian-- DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 50. 86 CONTINUED: (2) 86 VOICE (ZUS) LEAVE NOW AND WE WON'T SHOOT THE REST OF YOU! POLICEMAN DON'T BE A FOOL. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF US! ZUS THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF US! WHO IS THE FOOL? The policemen exchange apprehensive looks. TUVIA WHERE ARE YOU FROM? POLICEMAN KARELITZ! The confrontation changes languages. BEN ZION I'M FROM KARELITZ, TOO. I LIVED BY THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE. POLICEMAN MAYBE I KNOW YOU. SHOW YOURSELF! BEN ZION YOU FIRST! Derisive laughter from the trees. POLICEMAN Give us Bielski and the rest of you can go free! Behind a tree, Tuvia is surprised by the mention of his name. TUVIA You are from Belarussia, pig! Why do you work for the Germans against your own people? KISSELY For the same reason you steal from the poor. To survive. ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT. Kessely is hit in the arm. KISSELY (CONT'D) Shit. ZUS Next one is to the head! DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 51. 86 CONTINUED: (3) 86 TUVIA Soon it will be dark... See how you find your way home then! The policemen are having similar thoughts. SUDDENLY - A POLICEMAN BREAKS AND RUNS AWAY Soon it's a full-scale retreat. AFTER A MOMENT Tuvia, Zus, Lova & Ben Zion emerge. Zus picks up the dead German's machine pistol. TUVIA (CONT'D) They'll be back. We have to find a new camp. ZUS Next time just draw them a map. TUVIA What does that mean? ZUS It means -- we should have killed the fucking milkman. Your policy of diplomacy is shit. Zus is breathing hard, full of the adrenaline of battle. ZUS (CONT'D) ...Two are dead. Winter is coming and now we have no shelter. Why? Because you don't have the stomach to do what must be done. He walks away. CUT TO: 87 OMITTED 87 DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 52. 88 THE NOVEMBER WIND WHISTLES THROUGH THE BARE FOREST (MONTAGE) 88 as the group trudges along -- weighed down by cooking gear, food, guns, etc. Asael takes the iron cauldron from Chaya. Zus and Bella walk side-by-side. Pinchas leads his goat. MALBIN Where is he taking us? My feet are going to fall off. SHIMON A great rabbi once said, \"wherever I go, I am always going to the land of Israel.\" MALBIN Well, maybe rabbis should give better directions. Tuvia walks alongside but apart. CUT TO: 89 A HILLSIDE 89 The group is sprawled on the ground. Four people share a single cigarette. Shimon and Malbin hardly have the energy to argue. Pinchas feeds his goat. Tuvia walks among them. TUVIA Rest and eat. I need volunteers for a scouting party. Zus raises his hand. Tuvia nods in grudging gratitude. However mixed his feelings, Zus can always be counted on. CUT TO: 90 A FORK IN THE TRAIL 90 Tuvia looks at Zus, who shrugs. They are in unfamiliar territory. As they move cautiously forward: A MAN IN A RED ARMY TUNIC steps into the path, holding an automatic rifle. He WHISTLES softly. More ARMED MEN materialize, surrounding them. GRAMOV WHO ARE YOU? Tuvia instantly grasps the situation. He salutes. TUVIA A brigade of independent fighters searching for our comrades. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 52A. 90 CONTINUED: 90 Zus almost does a double-take at Tuvia's bluff. GRAMOV What brigade? YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 53. 90 CONTINUED: (2) 90 TUVIA We belong to the Bielski otriad. GRAMOV We know of you. Jewish bandits. Zus's finger tightens on the trigger of his submachine gun. ZUS I'll take the two on the left... Tuvia maintains his composure. TUVIA I'm sure we can clear up this misunderstanding with your commander. CUT TO: 91 THE OCTOBER OTRIAD BASE 91 A primitive tent camp. RUSSIAN PARTISANS move about, quiet and cold-eyed men wearing remnants of Red Army uniforms. Zus can't help but be impressed by the array of weaponry. VICTOR PACHENKO emerges from a tent. A former lieutenant, dashing in a fur cap and long officer's coat. He addresses them in Russian. VIKTOR I am Viktor Panchenko, commander of the October otriad. We have had complaints of a Jewish gang stealing from villages loyal to us. How do you respond to these charges? TUVIA When you take food it is from loyal supporters. When we do, you call it stealing. VIKTOR We are soldiers. TUVIA And we fight a common enemy. The motherland doesn't distinguish between Jews and non-Jews. Viktor is amused by this bit of Soviet dogma. VIKTOR But Jews do not fight. DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 54. 91 CONTINUED: 91 TUVIA These Jews do. Viktor appraises Tuvia for a moment. VIKTOR We will see. Select your best fighters and send them to us. Zus looks at Tuvia, knowing he has no choice. TUVIA We are honored to be of service. Tuvia and Zus SALUTE and head back the way they came. ZUS So we're partisans now. TUVIA As if we have a choice. CUT TO: 91A NEW CAMP (CAMP #2) 91A Has taken root. People hard at work building zemylanka. 92 THE NEW CAMP (CAMP #2) 92 Tuvia and Malbin are working together on a new bunker. Malbin expertly nails a header across a doorway. TUVIA (throwing a smaller HAMMER) Here. MALBIN If my friends at The New Socialists' Club could see me now... I haven't read a book in months. TUVIA I haven't read one in years. Malbin looks up from his work. TUVIA (CONT'D) I wasn't a very good student. You can ask Shimon. MALBIN .I did. Tuvia laughs ruefully. Considers him for a moment. TUVIA Yet you accept me as Commander. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 55. 92 CONTINUED: 92 Malbin thinks about it for a moment. MALBIN Who else? Tuvia nods. Good point. They continue working. MALBIN (CONT'D) Might I make an observation? Tuvia gestures, go ahead. MALBIN (CONT'D) We need to be strong, but-- TUVIA ...But--? MALBIN Other things are important, too. TUVIA Such as? Malbin tries to think how best to put it. MALBIN Community. Tuvia considers the word. As if trying it on for size. TUVIA You have more ideas? About all this? MALBIN ...A few. TUVIA I'm listening... 93 MEANWHILE, THE WOMEN WATCH AS ASAEL LEADS IN NEW ARRIVALS 93 BELLA More mouths to feed. RONA More young bodies to keep us warm. One ot them, a young man, YITZHAK SHULMAN, RIPS the yellow Star-of-David off his coat and kneels to KISS THE GROUND. SHULMAN Which one is Tuvia Bielski? Someone points Tuvia out. Shulman hurries over and kisses Tuvia's hand. Zus is drinking nearby with his cronies. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 55A. 93 CONTINUED: 93 SHULMAN (CONT'D) None of us knew if you really existed. I am from Baranowicze. They are going to liquidate the ghetto. Chaya bursts into tears. Asael puts his arm around her. CHAYA My parents-- Zus catches Tuvia's glance to Malbin. Tuvia turns back to Shulman. TUVIA We'll do what we can. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 56. 93 CONTINUED: (2) 93 Shulman tries to kiss Tuvia's hand once again, but Tuvia takes his hand, instead, and shakes it. CHAYA looks deeply into Asael's eyes. CHAYA You will help my parents? ASAEL I...I... CHAYA I've seen you looking at me. If you were to rescue them, I would do... anything...you-- Asael is completely undone by the starkness of this. ASAEL No. I mean, yes. All right. 94 ZUS CATCHES UP TO TUVIA 94 and grabs him as he walks away. Their hushed tones belie the growing chasm between them. GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 57. 94 CONTINUED: 94 ZUS And what exactly does that mean, 'do what we can.' TUVIA We must send for whoever is left alive. ZUS And if it is a hundred? Six hundred? TUVIA Then we will provide. ZUS And when the Germans follow these hundreds and slaughter us. TUVIA I won't let that happen. Tuvia exchanges a glance with Malbin. Zus catches it. He has sensed Malbin's growing influence. ZUS You won't let that happen. TUVIA No. I'll bring them out myself. ZUS From the ghetto. TUVIA Yes. ZUS Pan Tuvia. Rabbi Tuvia. Allow me to kiss your hand... Tuvia tries to pull his hand away, but Zus holds him. ZUS (CONT'D) You think Pachenko wants hundreds more of us in the forest? TUVIA I cannot have you contradicting me... Not when others are around. Our family must stick together. TAN Revision - 9-10-07 58. 94 CONTINUED: (2) 94 ZUS And who is it that's risking our family, and for what? For the sake of these-- (gestures at the new ARRIVALS) --Malbushim. TUVIA Don't call them that. ZUS That's who comes to us from the ghetto. Empty clothes. Bloodsuckers. TUVIA They are people. Jews. ZUS Pretentious Jews. Jews who stuck up their noses and wouldn't give us the time of day when we passed them on the street. Jews who went out of their way to keep their daughters locked away from our dirty hands. You think your old teacher will give you a good grade because you saved his worthless ass! They accept you as their leader only because they are too weak and full of shit to help themselves. TUVIA --What about Bella? Tuvia looks over at Bella, who is anxiously watching. TUVIA (CONT'D) --You think she'd be with you if it wasn't for what is happening here? Zus glares at him, but tries to control himself. TUVIA (CONT'D) --Is it love Zus? DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 59. 94 CONTINUED: (3) 94 Zus is sick of talk. He PUNCHES Tuvia in the face. Tuvia is rocked but still he goads his brother. TUVIA (CONT'D) You are the man of her dreams? The Romeo of Novagrudok? Zus can't take anymore. He charges Tuvia, who sidesteps and SLAMS him in the gut. All the frustration of the past months, not to mention years of sibling rivalry, translates into fists and elbows. Ben Zion moves to break it up. Tuvia and Zus turn on him. ZUS Is this your business? Zus gains the upper hand and starts to beat the crap put of Tuvia. Finally, in desperation Tuvia rolls away and picks up a rock. He is about to slam it into his brother's head when suddenly he stops himself. The two brothers look at each other, both breathing heavily -- realizing that they have crossed some line. ZUS (CONT'D) Ben Zion. Krensky. Lova. Israel. Let's go. We are going to join the real partisans. He looks at Asael. ZUS (CONT'D) Are you coming? Asael looks at one brother, then the other. Once again, he is in the middle. He looks at Chaya, then back at Zus. ASAEL No. ZUS Good. I'll dance at your wedding. He stops by Bella's side, touches her arm, then disappears down the trail. The others follow. CUT TO: 95 THE OUTSKIRTS OF NOVOGRUDOK 95 Tuvia and Asael feel naked outside the safety of the forest. In the distance the city looms. 95A THE STREETS OF NOVOGRUDOK 95A Tuvia and Asael pass by the barbed wire and machine-guns of the guards and dogs manning the barrier to the ghetto. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 59A. 96 THE WALLS OF THE NOVOGRUDOK GHETTO 96 Tuvia and Asael climb over a dilapidated wall. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 60. 97 THE DESERTED STREETS OF THE GHETTO 97 People peer out from behind shuttered windows. Others hurry to get off the street. Tuvia consults a hand-drawn map. TUVIA This way. 98 OMITTED 98 98A EXT. FOREST - DAY 98A Zus, Lova and Ben Zion march alongside the Russians Partisans. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 61. 99 AN APARTMENT IN THE GHETTO - DAY 99 that might once have been home to a family-of-four now HOUSES fifteen. Tuvia and Asael are deep in conversation with several ELDERS of the ghetto Council ELDER #1 We are not so naive as to believe they won't kill some of us. But all the Jews? It makes no sense. They need us to work. In the factories. The labor camps. Tuvia notices A PRETTY GIRL standing on a chair in order to hear. Her name is LILKA and we will soon come to know her. YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 62. 99 CONTINUED: 99 TUVIA There are rumors. Of death camps. ELDER #1 We too have heard of such places. But have you seen them yourself? Can you tell me, with absolute certainty, that we are not just as likely to die out there with you in the woods with Winter coming on...? Someone WHISTLES from the street below. A tense moment. Another whistle. All clear. ELDER #1 (CONT'D) --Do you think we haven't all considered running away? For every one that leaves they kill twenty. How can I sacrifice thousands for the sake of a few?\" Tuvia looks at them, rubbing his face in concentration. TUVIA What if we were to take all of you? ELDER #1 The old, the sick? There are thousands. How will we live? TUVIA We will protect you. We have made alliances with the Russian Partisans. ELDER #1 They are as bad as the Nazi's. You are too young to know the pogroms-- DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 63-63A. 99 CONTINUED: (2) 99 Tuvia SLAMS HIS FIST on a table. TUVIA YOU WANT TIME? Fine, I give you a day. A month. Maybe a year. To live! Your daughter is out there with us. Your husband is waiting for you. An old orthodox RABBI stands nearby. TUVIA (CONT'D) Rabbi? RABBI We...are waiting for God. Tuvia looks at him in disbelief. Such madness is incontrovertible. A suspended moment. LILKA I am going. This breaks the log jam. Several others join in, \"We are coming,\" \"Us, too,\" etc. Tuvia nods his acknowledgment. CUT TO: 100 A COURTYARD IN THE NOVOGRUDOK GHETTO - NIGHT 100 A crude tunnel has been dug through a ghetto wall. PEOPLE squeeze through into the adjoining alley. Behind them, a hundred more await their turn. Out in the alley, Asael stops them momentarily as a car goes by at the end of the street, then gives the all-clear. Tuvia takes Lilka' hand and helps her pass through. Their eyes meet for just a moment. CUT TO: 100A OMITTED 100A DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 63B-63C. 101 THE FOREST CAMP 101 The new ARRIVALS file in. Men wear citified coats and some women have furs. They eye the veterans, thinking, 'how dirty they are'; the veterans eye them warily, wondering, 'How will we feed them?' A handmade sign reads, \"New Jerusalem.\" Chaya is re-united with her parents. She holds Asael's arm and looks up at him with absolute rapture. She is his. Malbin is collecting valuables. One WELL-DRESSED WOMAN is reluctant to part with her jewelry. WELL-DRESSED WOMAN But they were my grandmother's... GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 64. 101 CONTINUED: (2) 101 MALBIN And now they belong to the otriad. Everyone sacrifices for the sake of the collective. We can trade these for food or weapons. Next... Nearby, Shimon is INTERVIEWING another line of arrivals. SHIMON --How about carpenters? Any bootmakers? Seamstresses? ARRIVAL #1 I am an accountant. SHIMON That should come in handy. Next... RIVA I am a nurse. SHIMON Ahhh...welcome. And you, tateh? OPPENHEIM is an old man with thick glasses. OPPENHEIM I am a watchmaker. Tuvia has walked over to observe. TUVIA Can you repair guns? OPPENHEIM Guns? No. TUVIA See if you can fix this trigger. Oppenheim slips on a pair of spectacles and studies the mechanism. It sticks. He digs into his pocket and produces a small file and expertly begins to shave the metal spur. He tests it, then hands it back to Tuvia, who CLICKS the trigger. TUVIA (CONT'D) You have a new profession. A murmur of appreciation ripples through the group as Shulman appears -- leading A MAGNIFICENT WHITE HORSE. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 65. 101 CONTINUED: (3) 101 SHULMAN Look what we found running free. Must have belonged to an aristocrat. TUVIA My God, she's beautiful. May I? He mounts her easily, urges her around the perimeter, greeting the new arrivals. Heads turn as he trots past. He is the center of attention, and he knows it. And likes it. TUVIA (CONT'D) Friends, we are happy to see you safely among us. But there are many things you must learn about living here... All attention turns to him. The Lubczanski brothers grumble to each other, none too pleased with Tuvia's show-boating. TUVIA (CONT'D) Once you are settled, you'll be assigned work duties. Everyone works, no exceptions. 101A INTERCUT IMAGES 101A Of people being introduced to various tasks: shoemaking, sewing, cooking. Asael teaching them to use guns. TUVIA We will help supply the Russian Partisans by making clothes, repairing guns. 101B BACK TO TUVIA ON HORSEBACK 101B Malbin catches his eye and winks -- clearly this has been part of their \"strategy\" discussions. TUVIA Women will learn to use weapons and fight alongside men. Tuvia takes a rifle from Asael and holds it aloft. TUVIA (CONT'D) This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword. You will all learn to protect yourselves. A LITTLE BOY holds Lilka's hand and looks up at Tuvia in wonder. He cuts an iconic figure. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 65A. 101B CONTINUED: 101B LITTLE BOY He is a Jew? Lilka is equally struck -- although there is something more than wonder in her regard. She nods. TUVU Pregnancies are forbidden. We cannot accommodate an infant's needs. Our bunkers are overcrowded so you will have to build new ones. He looks out over the sea of expectant faces. TUVIA ...This is the one place in all of Belorussia where a Jew can be free. We will make again, here in this forest, the life that was taken from you. We welcome you into our community. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 66. 101C LATER - TUVIA IS WALKING HIS HORSE BESIDE THE RIVER 101C when Riva stops him. RIVA You are Tuvia Bielski? You are really him? (Tuvia nods TENTATIVELY) You are a hero. A Maccabee. She vigorously shakes Tuvia's hand and walks away. Tuvia catches his reflection in the water. And likes it. 102 THE CAMP AT DAWN - TO ESTABLISH 102 102A IN AN UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAWN 102A Lilka awakens to find TEN WOMEN wedged in beside her -- back to front -- like spoons. Idly, she begins to ITCH her scalp. Then her leg. In the pale morning light she sees that she is crawling with lice. She SCREAMS. The women around her wake up, terrified. LILKA Get them off! Get them off me! CHAYA What? Where? LILKA EVERYWHERE! OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD... RIVA Lice need somewhere to sleep, too. The others LAUGH, but Lilka is on the verge of hysteria. She stumbles out, stepping on several others as she goes. 102B OUTSIDE THE BUNKER 102B Crying, she tears at her clothes -- only to discover Tuvia and OTHERS staring at her with interest. She is mortified. 102C LATER THAT DAY 102C THE WOMEN wash clothes in the stream. Lilka is by the riverbank, scrubbing furiously. Tamara works beside her. TAMARA You get rid of them quicker if you boil them. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 66A. 102C CONTINUED: 102C Lilka is grateful for this bit of camp wisdom. BELLA Tamara, come on in, it's freezing and slimy and horrible. Tamara shakes her head, no. RIVA So modest... BELLA ... So last night I dreamed I was taking a real bath. With hot water. RACHEL And soap. YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 66B. 102C CONTINUED: (2) 102C RIVA And bubbles. CHAYA Oh, take me to that dream! RIVA I was dreaming of shoes... CHAYA Shoes, Riva? RIVA There was a man in a shop on Grudek street... and the way he caressed my feet when I tried on his shoes... Riva swoons. The women burst into ribald laughter. The SOUND of a horse. They look to the opposite bank where: TUVIA RIDES BY on his horse. Lilka can't help but stare. BELLA Doesn't take a fortune teller to know what Lilka's dreaming about... Lilka blushes furiously. The women laugh even louder. CUT TO: 103 A FLAT STRETCH OF TRAIN TRACK 103 Gramov shows Zus how to plant a disk-like CONTACT MINE. GRAMOV --buried underneath with this DETONATOR-- (indicates a finger- like protrusion) --almost touching the rail. As the train passes, its weight causes pressure on the detonator, and then-- BOOM! Zus falls over, startled. Gramov laughs. Partisan humor. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 67. 104 FOREST CAMP #2 104 Chaya is on kitchen detail with Tamara. TAMARA Yesterday, potatoes with beets, Today, beets with potatoes. Special treat tomorrow...potato soup. With beets. Not far away, Arkady and several others have created a primitive still -- turning potatoes into vodka. ARKADY We love potatoes, don't we, boys! Here, put some hair on your chest! They give Aron his first taste. NEARBY Bella is walking, arm in arm, with Asael. BELLA So...a little bird told me that a certain someone is waiting...for another certain someone to ask a certain question... Go on... She indicates Chaya by wiggling her eyebrows in her direction. Asael shakes his head but heads in that direction. 104A NEARBY 104A Asael \"happens\" to bump into Chaya. ASAEL Hello, Chaya. CHAYA Hello, Asael. ASAEL May...I help you? CHAYA Wash clothes? I... don't think so. An awkward moment as he stands there watching her. ASAEL Chaya... I...was...wondering...if... maybe...you...I mean... you and I-- DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 67A. 104A CONTINUED: 104A CHAYA I accept. ASAEL You do? CHAYA I do. 104B ANOTHER DAY 104B Asael and Chaya are getting married. A LIGHT SNOW is falling as they say repeat their vows as Shimon instructs. Their breath condenses in the cold. ASAEL Behold thou art consecrated unto me by this ring according to the Laws of Moses and Israel. But rather than a ring, Asael gives her a shiny new rifle. As the ceremony continues, we: 104C INTERCUT: A TREE LINE OVERLOOKING A MUDDY ROAD 104C Zus, Ben Zion and several BIELSKI FIGHTERS hide alongside TEN RUSSIAN PARTISANS as a GERMAN TROOP TRUCK approaches. Pachenko watches as Zus follows the approaching truck through binoculars, then cocks the heavy machine gun. The truck SLOWS TO A CRAWL as it encounters an overturned PEASANT CART blocking the road. 104D BACK TO THE WEDDING 104D As Asael kisses the bride, Tuvia is staring not at the newlyweds but rather at Lilka, who has washed and let down her hair. She glances up and meets his eye, then looks away. As Asael crushes the traditional glass underfoot: 104E ZUS OPENS FIRE. 104E The driver SLUMPS over the wheel and the truck careens lazily off the road. GERMAN SOLDIERS spill out, blindly returning fire as Zus's fighters SWARM down the hill. Several are HIT right away. 104F INTERCUT: THE GROWING ECSTASY OF THE WEDDING CELEBRATION 104F WITH THE FRENZY OF BATTLE. People dance and sing, their joy juxtaposed with the murderous intensity of the firefight, their twirling movements a cracked mirror of the death agonies of fighters of both sides as they are hit and fall. DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 67B. 104F CONTINUED: 104F Some of the inexperienced Jewish fighters freeze, some fire their weapons blindly. Ben Zion does well. ZUS RUNS AMONG THEM, fiercely EXHORTING them to attack. ZUS Get up! Move! SHOOT OR I'LL SHOOT YOU... FROM A VANTAGE POINT IN THE ROCKS Viktor watches, heartened by Zus' natural aggression. GERMAN SOLDIERS TAKE COVER behind the overturned truck effectively RETURNING FIRE. Several partisans are KILLED. ZUS PULLS A POTATO MASHER GRENADE from his belt and RUNS AT THE TRUCK in a mad headlong assault. ZUS (CONT'D) ARRRRGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH! He ROLLS THE GRENADE under the truck and dives away as it EXPLODES. The remaining Germans RAISE THEIR HANDS. CHEERING PARTISANS leap into the truck, capturing an arsenal of rifles and ammo. THE JEWISH FIGHTERS join in the looting. Boots, coats, blankets, etc. Zus approaches the wounded and captured German prisoners, kneeling in surrender, hands behind their necks. Without hesitation, he shoots them, point-blank, one after another. VIKTOR approaches Zus, who salutes. VIKTOR You are related to Bielski? ZUS I am a Bielski, too. Viktor looks at him appraisingly. VIKTOR Indeed. He walks away. Zus has found a home. 104G LATER - THE OTRIAD SINGS AND DANCES ON 104G as SNOW continues to fall. The young marriage is a celebration of hope over despair.

A driving wind. Bundled in scarves, overcoats and as many layers as they can wear, Bella and Chaya break ice in a pot. Tamara takes FROZEN LAUNDRY from a line. In a bunker, Malbin and Shimon shiver under a shared blanket. Women and children stare blankly into space. Riva unwraps rags from a man's foot and examines his toes, BLACK with frostbite. Asael and Tuvia are making their rounds. They pass Aron and Rachel who have built a snowman which they top off by adding a German helmet with a bullet hole in it. 109A IN A STORAGE AREA 109A Asael shows Tuvia the last few potatoes. ASAEL There is talk of returning to the ghetto. TUVIA Madness. ASAEL They've barely eaten in days. Even when our food missions manage to get through, there are armed patrols. Farmers who once helped us now guard their barns with shotguns. Tuvia considers for a moment. TUVIA Send out more missions. And bring shotguns. Tuvia sets off. In every face he passes, there's misery and accusation in the shivering bodies and trembling blue lips. Children stare at him with sunken, haunted eyes. 109AA A MAKESHIFT STABLE 109AA Tuvia visits his beautiful horse. He unties him. 109AB LATER - IN THE FOOD LINE 109AB A whisper runs through the group...\"meat\"...\"what kind?\"...\" Where'd it come from?\" Tuvia watches them eat hungrily. 109B OMITTED 109B DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 71. 109C OMITTED 109C AND AND 109D 109D 109E A STABLE - NIGHT 109E Snow falling outside. Several partisans are singing. Zus is drinking heavily with Viktor; they take pinches of salt with each swallow. Viktor finishes a bottle, tosses it. VIKTOR Another dead soldier! Zus looks at him, bleary-eyed, confused. Viktor explains: VIKTOR (CONT'D) More dead soldiers than empty bottles. ZUS That is so...Russian. He cracks open another bottle and takes a big slug. VIKTOR At least you drink like one. ZUS 'A Jew can't drink, a Jew can't fight.' What is it we are good at, Viktor? Dying. That is what we are good at. VIKTOR So tell me about this brother of yours... ZUS .Asael? VIKTOR You are such an idiot. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 71A. 109E CONTINUED: 109E ZUS I know who you mean... The Great Tuvia Bielski. Savior of the Jews and all around Big Shit. VIKTOR You compete with him. ZUS He competes with me. VIKTOR My older brother and I have the same relationship. ZUS He is a Big Shit also? VIKTOR A soldier. He was killed in the first hour of the German invasion. This sobers them up a bit. 109F IN THE ZEMYLANKA 109F LILKA is shivering, her eyes inward and unfocused. TUVIA Lilka? LILKA Sorry, Tuvia. I was...thinking. It's nothing. He looks at her intently, knowing there's more. LILKA (CONT'D) ...Every time new people come into camp, I keep hoping... even though, I know... (her teeth are CHATTERING) ...I'm sorry. TUVIA Everyone here has lost someone. She looks up at him, helpless to be so revealed. LILKA You too? TUVIA Here... He takes off his wool coat and puts it around her shoulders. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 71B. 109F CONTINUED: 109F LILKA No. Today I go on my first food mission. Tuvia's order has consigned her to this dangerous duty. TUVIA I will have Asael send someone else. LILKA No. I must go now. I want to go. She is clearly scared but desperate not to show it. He reaches into his belt and hands her a revolver. TUVIA You know how to use this? She nods. Leaving, she passes the Lubczanski brothers, who are on their way in. DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 72. 110 ON MOTL AND ARKADY 110 MOTL LUBCZANSKI She is a tasty one, your aristocrat. TUVIA She is not my aristocrat. ARKADY LUBCZANSKI No? We were told, 'hands off,' property of the Commander. Tuvia just stares, daring him to continue. 111 LATER THAT DAY 111 Tuvia walks past the now-empty stable heading into the woods. A voice calls out of the misty snow. VOICE HALT! WHO GOES THERE--! TUVIA Lazar. I am coming from camp. The danger is from those coming to camp. LAZAR Sorry, Tuvia... DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 73. 111 CONTINUED: 111 TUVIA No sign of the food mission? LAZAR Not yet. Tuvia looks anxiously into the deep woods. 111A MEANWHILE - DEEP IN THE WOODS 111A Lilka and Shulman are walking backwards, retracing their steps to obscure their footprints in the drifting snow. SHULMAN We mustn't have any tracks leading back to base. He loads two sacks of food onto her shoulders. SHULMAN (CONT'D) Stay on this side of the creek until you reach the river then up the hill. I'll wait here for the others. She nods and trudges on toward camp through waist-deep snow. 112 BACK IN CAMP - OUTSIDE A MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY 112 As they head toward a zemylanka, Riva is briefing Tuvia on the sick. Every now and then, he glances toward the woods. RIVA --several cases of pneumonia... Also I'm beginning to see signs of scurvy. No one's had a vegetable in weeks. LAZAR Tuvia! Lazar is dragging a WOUNDED MAN back into camp. RIVA Bring him to the infirmary. Tuvia glances back toward the woods. Looks at his watch. RIVA (CONT'D) ...Shulman will look after her. He looks up. She looks at him sympathetically. Apparently his interest in Lilka isn' quite as secret as he imagines. 112A BACK TO THE WOODS 112A Exhausted, cold and alone, Lilka is becoming increasingly disoriented in a snowy landscape where every tree looks DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 73A. 112A CONTINUED: 112A alike. She turns in a circle, trying to decide which way to go. A MANGY DOG appears out of nowhere, its coat matted, its ribs showing, a wild look in its eye. It GROWLS ferociously. LILKA Shoo-- Shoo-- DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 74. 112A CONTINUED: (2) 112A But the dog, as ravenous as she, smells the food and won't back down. It inches forward, FOAMING at the mouth. Lilka tries to step back but the dog LUNGES, snapping its jaws. It's terrifying. She looks desperately for help. Suddenly the dog LEAPS at her. She turns away and it rips a sack from her shoulder, knocking her down. Viciously it begins tearing the sack apart in search of the food within. A SHOT RINGS OUT. The dog drops. Lilka holds the smoking gun in two hands. Grimly, she pockets the weapon, picks up the sack of food, and starts off. Reconsidering, she walks back and hoists the dead dog onto her shoulder, too. More food. 112B IN THE INFIRMARY 112B Riva bandages Edjelman's head. Tuvia looks at all the sick. TUVIA What's wrong with them all? RIVA If it's typhus we're in trouble. The lice are carriers. ASAEL The partisans have ampicillin. But they say they need it for themselves. In the background Lilka enters, face scratched, blood smeared hands and arms -- like some kind of primitive huntress. ASAEL (CONT'D) Tuvia... TUVIA Medicine for typhus. I heard you. I'll go see Viktor right away. On his way out, he passes Lilka, who is being looked after. TUVIA (CONT'D) Are you all right? LILKA Fine. Thank you. Tuvia can clearly see that she is shaken -- but he has no time to ask more. He has to find out about the medicine. TUVIA I must go. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 75. 113 THE PARTISAN ENCAMPMENT (TO ESTABLISH SNOW) 113 114 INSIDE A TENT 114 Viktor, Gramov and Zus are poring over a map of the area. VIKTOR --and every time we try to move, they radio back to police HQ which houses the transmitter...here. ZUS --So we attack the transmitter. VIKTOR Yes, yes, my Hebrew warrior. Except for the troops in Stankiewcze and the machine guns out front. THE TENT FLAP OPENS. Tuvia enters. He has developed a cough. VIKTOR (CONT'D) Two Bielski's in one room! To what do we owe this honor? TUVIA We have sickness. I need ampicillin. VIKTOR This medicine is reserved for fighters. TUVIA If typhus breaks out in our camp, it may spread to yours. VIKTOR I will have to take that chance. Zus looks from one immovable force to the other. TUVIA I must insist. Comrade. VIKTOR You'd better not. Zus is watching this dick-measuring with keen interest. ZUS There would be medicine in the police headquarters at Stankiewcze, yes? BLUE Revision - 6-26-07 76. 114 CONTINUED: 114 He looks to Gramov, who looks to Viktor, who nods. ZUS (CONT'D) Tuvia and I grew up there. Perhaps the Bielski otriad will volunteer to take out the transmitter. Viktor looks from Zus to Tuvia. TUVIA Of course. Zus grabs his submachine gun. ZUS Krensky, Ben Zion. Let's go. CUT TO: 115 THE TOWN OF STAKIEWICZE 115 is quiet at midnight on this snowy evening. 116 IN A BACK ALLEY 116 Tuvia and Zus sit in the cab of an old truck, its exhaust sending plumes of condensation into the freezing night. ZUS Well... He looks into the back where the others wait, anxiously clutching their weapons. Tuvia tries to hold back a cough. ZUS (CONT'D) Stay with the truck. And make sure it's in gear when we get back. TUVIA I'm going in with you. ZUS I give the orders tonight. Across the square, the police station looms. TUVIA You don't have to do this. ZUS I don't? What about the typhus? PINK Revision - 7-18-07 77. 116 CONTINUED: 116 TUVIA So more die. They will anyway. A grim smile from Zus. Tuvia is broken up inside. ZUS I have been given this mission by my superior officer. He starts to get out the cab. Tuvia reaches into his pocket, takes out the mezuzah that once blessed their parents' home. TUVIA Zus... For luck. Zuz pockets it and joins the others creeping into the shadows. But rather than follow them into the police station, we HOLD on Tuvia's face. Suddenly we HEAR The sound of gunfire. Then nothing. Ten seconds. More gunfire. Twenty. It is excruciating. Thirty. The longest CLOSE-UP in film history. 117 INTERCUT - FLASHES OF WHAT IS HAPPENING INSIDE... 117 Ben Zion bursts in and opens fire, killing two policemen. Krensky jumps the counter and smashes the transmitter. A policeman appears behind them on the stairs and shoots Krensky in the back. Ben Zion whirls and kills him. 117A TUVIA WANTS TO HELP. HE PULLS HIS GUN, UNLOCKS THE DOOR. 117A OPENS IT. STOPS. HE HAS PROMISED TO WAIT WITH THE TRUCK. Zus, meanwhile, rummages cabinets, looking for ampicillin. BEN ZION Let's GO! In the back room, Zus keeps rummaging. A window EXPLODES. Ben Zion is hit. Mortally wounded, he sinks to his knees, returning fire as Zus reappears. 118 TUVIA WATCHES 118 as Zus bursts out the door. He races to the truck and struggles into the passenger seat, BLEEDING FROM HIS SHOULDER. ZUS Go. GO! TUVIA What about the others?! PINK Revision - 7-18-07 77A. 118 CONTINUED: 118 ZUS GO, DAMN YOU! 119 IN THE TRUCK (TRAVELING) 119 From his coat Zus takes out a BLOOD-SOAKED PACKAGE. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 78. 119 CONTINUED: 119 ZUS Medicine. TUVIA The others? ZUS Fighters die so that malbushim may live, that's what you believe, yes? Tuvia absorbs the accusation as if taking a punch. TUVIA So you're a communist now, Zus? Zus lays his head back on the seat, closes his eyes. ZUS Communist, Zionist, Manicurist, what difference does it make? You got your medicine. TUVIA Come back to us. Zus won't look at him. TUVIA (CONT'D) You are my brother. ZUS So you remember. CUT TO: 120 A MOURNER'S CIRCLE IN THE TREES 120 for Ben Zion and Krensky. Shimon addresses the group. SHIMON Merciful God, we commit our friends Ben Zion and Krensky to your care. We have no more prayers, no more tears. We have run out of blood. Choose another people We PAN PAST the familiar faces. SHIMON (CONT'D) We have paid for each of your Commandments. We have covered every field and stone with ashes. Sanctify another land. Choose another people. Teach them the Deeds and the Prophecies. Grant us but one more blessing -- Take back the gift of our holiness. YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 79. 121 IN A ZEMYLANKA - LATER THAT DAY 121 Tuvia is still drinking heavily. He is COUGHING STEADILY, his face sweaty with fever. The SOUND of angry voices from outside the bunker. 122 OUTSIDE - IN THE FOOD LINE 122 Arkady Lubczanski has pulled a knife on Asael, who backs away, STUMBLING into a group of bystanders. ARKADY Next time, I cut off your nose, pisher. Tuvia emerges from his bunker. He is weaving a bit and his words are slurred. TUVIA Whassa problem, Arkady? ARKADY Those who risk their lives to bring back food deserve a larger portion than those who risk nothing. ASAEL Everyone gets the same portion. ARKADY Not when you're serving, pisher. I see you digging to the bottom of the pot for your little forest cutie and her parents... ASAEL She is my wife! TUVIA Policy is...Same for all. If someone is stealing he'll face consequences. Asael is astonished that Tuvia would go against him in public and embarrassed by his public drunkenness. ASAEL What consequences? Others are closely watching this test of Tuvia's authority. TUVIA Reduced rations for one week. Both of you. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 80. 122 CONTINUED: 122 ARKADY WHAT?! TUVIA ARE YOU QUESTIONING MY DECISION? Arkady is tempted to take him on. But he backs down. TUVIA (CONT'D) This matter is settled. Everybody back in line. People are staring at him. TUVIA (CONT'D) WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? BACK IN LINE! His eyes meet Lilka's. She looks away. Asael takes Tuvia's arm and pulls him aside. ASAEL Tuvia, I would never-- TUVIA Yes. I know. ASAEL Then why am I to be punished...? Tuvia just takes another swallow from his bottle. ASAEL (CONT'D) Fischer is with them. So is Levine. On food missions, they take first for themselves and only bring back what's left over-- Tuvia's head is throbbing. He closes his eyes. ASAEL (CONT'D) --and they spread rumors, that you are power-hungry and corrupt, that you take whatever woman you choose-- (Tuvia can't help but laugh) --that we keep gold for ourselves, and that-- He stops himself. TUVIA --What? SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 81. 122 CONTINUED: (2) 122 ASAEL ...that you drink too much and are no longer fit to lead us. TUVIA .Maybe they're right. Asael looks at him. No longer the brother he once idealized. ASAEL Zus would have punched him senseless. TUVIA Zus. ASAEL I miss him. AY TUVIA He has made his choice. He reels away toward the woods. CUT TO: 122A IN HIS ZEMYLANKA - LATER 122A Tuvia is lying in his bunker, vomiting and burning up with fever. Shimon has brought him soup. SHIMON Drink this. From the bottom of the pot. Tuvia can barely get the soup down. TUVIA ...the way they look at me... with their pasty faces. Let them starve, we're all going to die out here anyway. SHIMON Not easy being the big boss. Moses was a lonely man when he led us out of bondage. TUVIA ...Moses. SHIMON So I'm a sucker for a biblical allusion. But what is society without leaders. Without leaders, we falter. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 81A. 122A CONTINUED: 122A TUVIA I am not a leader. SHIMON Neither was Moses, but somehow that seemed to work out. CUT TO: 123 THE PARTISAN CAMP 123 Several partisans are singing a drinking song while Zus silently soaks his feet in a bucket. Lova walks in. His face is black and blue. ZUS Lova, what happened? Who did this? Lova sits and buries his head in his hands. ZUS (CONT'D) Lova. Tell me. Who? LOVA Gramov. Two others. I used the officer's latrine. ZUS For this they beat you? Lova is trying not to weep. LOVA They said they wouldn't shit in the same hole as a Jew. Zus gets to his feet. CUT TO: 123A INT. PANCHENKO'S TENT -- MOMENTS LATER 123A Zus bursts in to find Panchenko deep in conversation with Gramov and others. They look up at the intrusion. ZUS Forgive me, Commander. PANCHENKO Zus. Join us. He offers him a glass of vodka. Zus doesn't take it. ZUS I want to report the mistreatment of a comrade. Gramov looks up. Zus meets his eye. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 81B. 123A CONTINUED: 123A ZUS (CONT'D) This man beat Comrade Lova -- for no reason at all. GRAMOV I had a perfectly good reason. He is a Jew. The other men LAUGH. Panchenko frowns at Gramov. PANCHENKO --and you are an ignorant Tartar. Ignore him. Here... ZUS Anti-semitism is a violation of Party discipline. Panchenko sighs. Does he really have to deal with this? PANCHENKO He's right, Gramov. Apologize to the Jew. GRAMOV I apologize, Jew. PANCHENKO There. You see? Now drink up. Zus doesn't know what to do. He accepts the vodka. 124 EXT. THE BIELSKI CAMP (TO ESTABLISH) 124 Guards ring the snowy perimeter. 125 OMITTED 125 126 THE BLURRED IMAGE OF AN ANGEL FRAMED BY A HALO OF SUNLIGHT 126 as it swims into focus. Tuvia opens his eyes. It is Lilka. She sits beside him, mopping his forehead with a cool rag. LILKA Your fever broke in the night. The medicine helped. TUVIA How long was I asleep? LILKA Two days. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 81C-83. 126 CONTINUED: 126 TUVIA And you've nursed me the whole time? LILKA Chaya helped. TUVIA Did you study nursing at university? LILKA We devoted ourselves to more essential knowledge -- like Greek Philosophy and Latin. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 84. 126 CONTINUED: (4) 126 TUVIA I never went to university. LILKA What kind of work did you do? Before. TUVIA My wife's father had a store. Before the Race Laws. She is is dead. LILKA I'm sorry. TUVIA Tell me more about university. LILKA It all feels like a dream. I spent months trying to master Chopin's nocturnes. TUVIA I'd love to hear you play. LILKA You know Chopin? TUVIA Who doesn't? Chopin the butcher from Novogrudok. LILKA If you're well enough to tease me, you're well enough to eat. I'll see what's for supper. She gets up to go. TUVIA Thank you, Lilka. 127 OUTSIDE TUVIA'S BUNKER 127 THE LUBCZANSKI'S have taken the fullest advantage of Tuvia's illness. There are now TWO LINES of people waiting for food. The malbushim line up like prison inmates. Lazar looks into his bowl -- two beans floating in a scummy broth. IN THE SHORTER LINE Motl, Arkady, Fischer, Levine and a few others are enjoying real food. Lazar calls out from the other line. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 85. 127 CONTINUED: 127 LAZAR Hey, Arkady This isn't soup, it's piss. ARKADY I will piss on your head and you will say it's raining. Eat it. The rest of Lubczanski's cabal laughs. TUVIA emerges from his bunker. The first thing he sees is Asael, whose face is BATTERED AND SWOLLEN. TUVIA What happened? Asael just looks over at the food line -- where Arkady has grabbed Chaya by the waist -- to the delight of the others. Tuvia strides over to them. TUVIA (CONT'D) What is this? ARKADY New policy. Fighters get better food. TUVIA Against my orders... ARKADY You are no longer Commander. Sorry. Tuvia nods, considering his remark for a moment. AND THEN TAKES OUT HIS PISTOL AND SHOOTS ARKADY IN THE CHEST! He then turns the gun on Motl and the others -- they literally cower in fear. He raises his voice to those watching. TUVIA As long as I am the leader of this group, you will obey my commands. THERE WILL BE NO MORE COMPLAINING! NO MORE SITTING! NO MORE DOING NOTHING. ANYONE WANTS TO LEAVE, THEY LEAVE. NOW! The rest work. Every morning we get up and we work. WE WORK. In the snow and the cold and the dark. Tomorrow we begin to build ten new zemylanka, we double the number of food missions. ...We work. Take his body into the woods and leave it for the wolves. He turns and walks away. As he passes the food lines, people subtly move out of his way and whisper after he is gone. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 85A. 127 CONTINUED: (2) 127 Whereas once he was greeted warmly by all, now his isolation is complete. He is the Commander. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 86. 127A TUVIA CAREENS THROUGH THE TREES 127A Tripping over roots, and finally leaning against a tree, he is mumbling, almost incoherent -- part prayer, part profanity. DISSOLVE TO: 128 OMITTED 128 129 THE FIRST BUD OF SPRING 129 struggles through patches of snow. Ice drips from branches. 130 OMITTED 130 130A THE OTRIAD 130A Takes a group portrait. The forest is green again. 131 THE SUNSHINE IS WARM 131 on the women's bodies as they bathe in the river. CHAYA Who has the soap? I know there was a little left? BELLA Use the sand. It's good for your skin. RIVA And what skin! And already married, too! Bella laughs. Chaya splashes her playfully with water. BELLA I've turned into a skeleton. CHAYA And you were always so worried about staying slim. BELLA When we get out of this forest I am going to eat only cake and grow as big as a house. Tamara appears. She's wearing a long overcoat. LILKA Join us. At least the sun is warm. (Tamara turns away; Lilka joins her) Tamara? TAMARA I can't, Lilka... I'm pregnant. DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 86A. 131 CONTINUED: 131 LILKA I had no idea. TAMARA I've kept it hidden for months but now it's obvious. No one can know. They move away from the others. Tamara shows her. TAMARA (CONT'D) It could come any day. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 87. 131 CONTINUED: (2) 131 LILKA ..Who is the father? TAMARA I--- It was when I was escaping. A man with a gun stopped me. I thought he was a Partisan. He told me to follow him and he took me to this place... The memory overwhelms her. She begins to break down. TAMARA (CONT'D) Inside me something broke....I wanted to die. Every night I have nightmares -- what will happen when Tuvia finds out. LILKA He will understand. TAMARA No. You mustn't tell him! LILKA I won't. Don't worry. What are you going to do? Tamara's eyes fill with a new resolve. TAMARA I feel this new life inside me. It's the only thing keeping me going. I won't give it up, I'll kill myself. Lilka puts her arm around her. 131A IN THE DEEP FOREST -- ARON IS OUT HUNTING 131A From his belt hang the pelts of two dead rabbits. He hears A SOUND. Three GERMAN SOLDIERS are putting camouflage on their helmets. Beyond, A GERMAN ARMORED COLUMN. The assault is coming. CUT TO: 132 THE CAMP 132 where Shimon and Malbin are playing chess. Shimon has developed a bad cough. MALBIN You call that a move? SHIMON I call it an inevitable conclusion based on unimpeachable reasoning. DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 A87. 132 CONTINUED: 132 SHIMON (CONT'D) The question, my friend the Genius, is what are you going to do about it. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 87A. 132 CONTINUED: (2) 132 MALBIN I'm thinking about what I'm going to do about it. SHIMON Aha! I got him! MALBIN You didn't get me. You think you got me? How about this? SHIMON Who would make a move like that? MALBIN A genius maybe. Tuvia has been listening nearby. Aron races into the camp. ARON Tuvia... We SEE Aron whispering in Tuvia's ear. DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 88. 132 CONTINUED: (3) 132 TUVIA Asael! Asael comes running. TUVIA (CONT'D) Get a message to Zus. He's got to tell Viktor they're coming. CUT TO: 133 OMITTED 133 133A EXT. CAMP PERIMETER - DAYS LATER 133A Tuvia stands peering out into the forest. Asael joins him. ASAEL Lazar spotted another patrol. They're getting closer. Tuvia nods. Suddenly, he HEARS a strange sound. An animal? TUVIA Do you hear that? 134 IN THE WOMEN'S ZEMYLANKA 134 We HEAR the SOUND for what it is... The cry of a newborn. A baby boy in this mud manger. Riva and Lilka have assisted. Tamara holds her new baby to her breast. Suddenly -- the blanket serving as a door is SWEPT ASIDE. TUVIA stands there. Tamara cries out and shields the baby. Lilka springs up and pushes him back outside. 135 OUTSIDE THE BUNKER 135 Tuvia walks angrily. Lilka keeps up. LILKA She promises not to take extra food... TUVIA This is against my orders. LILKA So you are going to shoot her, too? Tuvia stares at her. He has never seen this side of her. LILKA (CONT'D) Please, Tuvia. The baby is all she has to live for. TUVIA I cannot allow it. He turns away. DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 88A. 135 CONTINUED: 135 Lilka SPINS him around, surprising him with her strength and the strength of her passion. PINK Revision - 7-18-07 89. 135 CONTINUED: (2) 135 LILKA You must let it live! TUVIA I cannot keep the living alive. Tamara and the man who fathered this child are responsible for its fate. LILKA She was raped by the Nazis. Tuvia closes his eyes. He is tired of being in charge, tired of being the arbiter of other peoples' fate. LILKA (CONT'D) ...You tell us to hold onto our humanity. Not to become like animals. What better way than by bringing a life into this world of suffering and death. It's our only hope. Tuvia is undone by her intensity. The very nearness of her. The smell of her newly-washed hair. The glow of her skin. He looks at her. And nods in surrender. LILKA (CONT'D) Thank you, Tuvia. She kisses him. A chaste kiss of gratitude. She pulls back and they look into each other's eyes. The next kiss is something entirely different. TUVIA Lilka... LILKA I knew what was expected of the women here -- yet you never touched me... TUVIA Shhh.. LILKA I'm not afraid of anything, Tuvia. I'm not even afraid of you. They kiss deeply. 136 IN TUVIA'S BUNKER - LATER 136 Lilka lies in his arms. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 90. 136 CONTINUED: 136 TUVIA The Germans are coming into the forest. I don't know what is going to become of us. LILKA It doesn't matter. If I had stayed in the ghetto I'd be dead. You saved my life. TUVIA No. You have saved mine. He reaches for her but before they can begin to make love again-- THE BLANKET DOOR IS PUSHED ASIDE. Malbin is there. MALBIN Oh... ..I..... Hello, Lilka. LILKA Hello, Asael. TUVIA Yes? MALBIN We've caught one. CUT TO: 137 A GERMAN SS SCOUT, HANDS TIED BEHIND HIS BACK 137 is led into the clearing. He wears the same uniform as those who marched the villagers into the forest for execution. ASAEL He's a scout. TUVIA They're coming for us. Group members have begun to gather around him. They begin to hurl insults -- schtik drek, paskudnyak -- as the hapless man is pushed to his knees. ASAEL We found this in his pouch. He hands Tuvia a sheaf of documents -- including a map. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 91. 137 CONTINUED: 137 TUVIA Entrance points, wetlands, obstacles. You read this. SHIMON They've assigned an entire division to surround the forest. A tidal wave is coming. ASAEL Don't they have a war to fight? SHIMON Assault begins in two days. Passover. How fitting. Meanwhile, some of the group have begun TORMENTING the man. MOTL Monster! He kicks him in the head. SHULMAN Bulvan! Shulman PUNCHES him in the face. GERMAN COURIER Bitte....Bitte... TUVIA Did you reach Viktor? ASAEL He's on his way. The tormenting of the poor courier is gaining intensity. MALBIN TUVIA-- The German lets loose a torrent of pleading. GERMAN COURIER Ich habe frau und kinder! SHIMON He says he has a wife and children. Lazar picks up a stick. The German tries to crawl away; the crowd blocks his escape, pushing him back into the center. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 91A. 137 CONTINUED: (2) 137 LAZAR So did I! RIVA If you let him go, he will lead them back here. Tuvia looks at Malbin. What to do? CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 92. 137 CONTINUED: (3) 137 MALBIN Ask if he'll promise not to reveal our location. Shimon translates. SHIMON Sie mussen versprechen nicht zu sagan wo wir sind. The man looks up at him, pleadingly. GERMAN COURIER Nein....Nein... SHULMAN He'll say anything. He breaks the stick across the man's back. LAZAR We want justice... MOTL Justice... Soon it is a chant: \"Justice! .Justice!\" Tuvia looks at their faces. Only months ago they were decorous, civilized. Now they are hungry, almost feral. Murderous. Bella has been silently watching. She steps into the circle, looks down at the terrified German man. BELLA My son's name was David. David Kagan. We SEE now that she is holding a sharpened hoe. BELLA (CONT'D) He was fifteen. He had blue eyes. She raises it above her head. BELLA (CONT'D) He played the piano. She swings with all her might. The others watch with a mix of thrilled horror and perverse delight. A line has been crossed. Riva steps forward, holding a large shovel. RIVA My sister's name was Ellie... As she swings the shovel, the CAMERA begins to back away. Miriam steps forward, carrying a large rock. MIRIAM My husband was Meyer... The group closes in, obscuring our view of the body. Aron can't take any more. He runs off into the woods.

Tuvia walks away. Behind them, the group separates -- staring at the lifeless body on the ground. And then they look at each other, their blood lust sated, beginning to reckon with what they have done. What they have become. 138 TUVIA STANDS ALONE IN THE FOREST, HIS FACE IN SHADOW 138 He sees Aron, squatting beside a tree, crying silently. Tuvia kneels beside him, cradling him. TUVIA Reeboynoy shel oylum... Lord of the Universe. We have done unspeakable things yet still I seek your mercy... He HEARS something. Malbin waits at the edge of the forest. His face is drawn and pale from what has just happened. DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 93. 138 CONTINUED: 138 MALBIN Viktor is here. CUT TO: 139 VIKTOR AND ZUS 139 are waiting in the clearing. Tuvia approaches. He and Zus nod to each other but do not speak. It is excruciating. Tuvia and Viktor walk into the woods. Zus waits with other BODYGUARDS as Asael joins them. Zus wears a Nazi jacket. ZUS He doesn't look good. ASAEL I could say the same about you. Where'd you get the jacket? ZUS Let's just say the former owner no longer had need of it. Zus winks. The other bodyguards stare impassively. ZUS (CONT'D) Embrace me. Asael looks confused for a moment, then embraces him. ZUS (CONT'D) Hide this. (shoves a revolver into his pocket) Wolnicky stores ammunition for us in his barn. There's no guard. He slaps Asael fondly on the cheek and rejoins his comrades. 140 VIKTOR AND TUVIA 140 sit on a downed tree and converse in Russian, with subtitles: VIKTOR You found these on the prisoner? Tuvia nods. Viktor studies the scout's documents. Tisking. TUVIA We can't fight an entire division. VIKTOR The battle on the Eastern Front has begun. The more troops we engage here, the fewer they have to attack the Motherland. DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 93A. 140 CONTINUED: 140 TUVIA We've done our part for the Motherland. BUFF Revision - 9-2-07 94. 140 CONTINUED: (2) 140 VIKTOR My orders are to take command of all partisan operations. You will bring the rest of your fighters to me. TUVIA And the others? Old people, women and children. VIKTOR In war there are casualties. TUVIA And if I refuse? VIKTOR You are officially a deserter. Do you know the policy on dealing with deserters? Viktor unfolds a paper flyer from his pocket. VIKTOR (CONT'D) ...The Germans are offering fifty thousand marks for information leading to your capture. Not a very flattering likeness. Too Jewish. Viktor rejoins his bodyguards, turns back for a last word. VIKTOR (CONT'D) Have your men in my camp by tonight. He walks off. Asael takes the wanted poster from Tuvia. ASAEL I wouldn't show this around. There are some who'd turn you in for less. CUT TO: 141 LATER - A SPOTTER PLANE BUZZES HIGH ABOVE - HUNTING 141 Down below, Viktor and the Russian partisans have struck their tents and hidden beneath the sheltering trees. Viktor's gaze follows the plane. He gives an order into a field radio. Zus has been listening. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 95. 141 CONTINUED: 141 ZUS You want them to find Tuvia's camp. Viktor just looks at him. ZUS (CONT'D) You're deliberately sacrificing them so we can remain safe? VIKTOR No. So we can keep fighting. Everyone must sacrifice in the struggle. ZUS Those are my brothers. VIKTOR I am your brother! He is your brother! Comrade Zus. Your Jewish sentimentality is heart-warming, but counter-revolutionary. Zus has secretly known he would hear these words. He grips his rifle but holds his tongue. BACK TO: 142 THE SPOTTER PLANE -- FLIES OVER THE BIELSKI CAMP 142 Tuvia stares up at it. Have they been spotted? Shimon is sitting nearby with a group of children. He looks pale. His cough is worse. He is very ill. SHIMON ...but the children of Israel were afraid to leave Egypt. Until Moses said, 'Do not trust in me, trust in God.' He will take care of you' And so tomorrow we celebrate the Passover by sitting around and arguing just as we have done for centuries. Tuvia stares at them, a curious expression on his face. Malbin comes to stand beside him. MALBIN Did it see us? PINK Revision - 7-18-07 96. 142 CONTINUED: 142 TUVIA Tomorrow is Passover. Yes? MALBIN ...How should I know? TUVIA Moses. The Exodus. Malbin doesn't get it at first. TUVIA (CONT'D) --He left before Pharaoh could stop them. Now Malbin understands. He looks at Shimon. MALBIN You want to move them all? The old, the sick. They'll never make it. It isn't the first time Tuvia has consigned people to their death, and apparently it won't be the last. TUVIA We leave now. Spread the word. 143 MOMENTS LATER - THE BIELSKI CAMP 143 is a blur of activity as everyone mobilizes for evacuation. Sacks and cooking equipment is tied onto impromptu packs. Asael and Malbin coax the older people into motion-- ASAEL Come, tateh-- OPPENHEIM But my tools-- The SOUND of approaching aircraft. Tuvia searches the sky. Riva pairs each of the elderly with a child. Tamara tucks her newborn under her coat. The SOUND of the approaching aircraft grows LOUDER. People look up, shielding their eyes. Then from out of the sun, two ominous silhouettes: STUKA DIVE BOMBERS! TUVIA TAKE COVER! 144 THE SCREAMING WHISTLE OF THE FIRST BOMBER 144 panics the crowd. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 97. 144 CONTINUED: 144 Some race into the forest; others are frozen. Tuvia grabs people and bodily drags them to cover. STRAFING 20MM CANNON chew up the ground. Several people are hit before they can reach cover. Lilka herds everyone she can into: 145 A BUNKER 145 where people crowd in like sardines. Chaya and Riva gather children around them. They hear the WHISTLE of an incoming shell....BOOM! Dirt from the roof rains down on them. 146 BOMBS BEGIN TO RAIN DOWN 146 Dirt and debris everywhere. AN INCENDIARY SHELL HITS high in a tree. Its branches burst into flame. An hysterical woman leaps out of a bunker and is BLOWN APART. 147 MEANWHILE - IN VIKTOR'S CAMP 147 Zus listens helplessly to the distant sound of bombs dropping on his brothers. 148 BACK IN THE BIELSKI CAMP - A DIRECT HIT ON A ZEMYLANKA 148 It explodes into a million pieces. Wood shrapnel everywhere. Where once was a bunker, now there is only a gaping crater. Tuvia races into the maelstrom to help the wounded. AN EXPLOSION KNOCKS HIM DOWN He tries to clear his head but he cannot focus. ALL SOUND FADES AWAY to be replaced by a high-pitched hum. 149 TUVIA'S WORLD IS IN SLOW-MOTION 149 Falling dirt and debris, tumbling bodies, exploding bunkers -- a surreal effect. 150 IN REAL TIME -- THE CAMP IS BEING TORN APART 150 Cowering in safety, Malbin sees Tuvia lying in the open and gathers his courage -- RACING through danger to his side. MALBIN Are you alright? Tuvia shakes his head, points to his ears. He cannot hear. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 98. 150 CONTINUED: 150 MALBIN (CONT'D) ARE...YOU...ALRIGHT? When Tuvia speaks, his WORDS sound DULL and MUFFLED. TUVIA MUST...GO! MALBIN ...WHAT? TUVIA THE GERMANS...COMING...! Malbin looks around, panicked. Asael appears out of the smoke, yells at Malbin above the din. ASAEL Get them out of the bunkers! Malbin runs off. Asael helps Tuvia to his feet. A nearby explosion SHOWERS THEM with dirt as they CRAWL to safety. The world RAMPS BACK TO NORMAL SPEED at a dizzying rate. ASAEL (CONT'D) We need to hold them off...until the rest are safe. Tuvia still can't hear. Asael pantomimes firing a rifle. ASAEL (CONT'D) ...HOLD...THEM...OFF! Tuvia nods, trying to clear the buzzing in his head. TUVIA ...MACHINE GUN... ASAEL With Levine and Miriam... There. Lazar, Rosa, and Schmuel. There and there. And me. Tuvia shakes his head, no. ASAEL (CONT'D) Yes. He runs off. Still clearing his head, Tuvia regains his footing -- suddenly realizing the the bombing has stopped. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 98A. 151 AT THE ENTRY WAY TO A ZEMYLANKA 151 Malbin appears, eyes wild. MALBIN Everybody out! Now! But the group's natural reaction is to stay huddled in safety GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 99. 151 CONTINUED: 151 MALBIN (CONT'D) THE COSSACKS ARE COMING! This gets the job done. People begin to crawl out. 152 OTHERS EMERGE FROM THE BUNKERS 152 YOUNG PEOPLE holding hands with OLD, PARENTS with CHILDREN on their backs. Tuvia urges Lilka and Bella to hurry them into the woods. 153 MEANWHILE -- THE ASSIGNED DEFENDERS, MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE 153 take up their assigned positions: Levine mans the heavy machine gun behind a log; Lazar, Miriam and Rosa in the trees. Tuvia anxiously waits for the last of the women and children to disappear into the forest. A SUDDEN SILENCE DESCENDS - EVERYONE LOOKS TO THE SKY Tuvia realizes the bombers have broken off their attack. He knows the ground troops will soon follow. He turns to Asael, grabbing his shoulders. TUVIA Don't try to fight... Just slow them down. Then join us. Asael nods. No need for more words. They embrace fiercely. Asael pushes Chaya toward Tuvia. ASAEL Take her. She resists, clinging to his arm for a moment. TUVIA Come. He forces her to join him and catch up to the others. 154 THE CAMP 154 is eerily quiet as the dust begins to settle. The defenders check their weapons with grim efficiency. They are no longer inept innocents; they have become warriors. 155 DEEPER IN THE WOODS 155 Tuvia catches up with the fleeing group and urges them on. 156 MOMENTS LATER -- THE DEFENDERS WAIT ANXIOUSLY 156 We study their faces. Beautiful in their stoic acceptance. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 99A. 156 CONTINUED: 156 SUDDENLY -- A FUSILLADE from the woods. Rosa falls dead. The defenders RETURN FIRE. Levine fires the machine gun; Miriam feeds the belt. 157 UP AHEAD WITH THE FLEEING GROUP 157 Tuvia hears small arms fire. He knows what it means. BUFF Revision - 9-2-07 100. 158 BACK AT THE CAMP 158 The rear guard action can't hold out for very long. Tree by tree, they begin to fall back. Asael fires blindly into the murky shadows. The SOUND of a man crying out. Then Levine is hit. Miriam pushes him out of the way and TAKES OVER. She expertly kills several assault troops who appear out of the woods. The rest of the attackers TAKE COVER. 159 WITH THE FLEEING GROUP 159 Malbin waits anxiously for Tuvia, clutching a map. MALBIN (struggling to control his panic) This swamp here...goes...for miles. TUVIA Show me. 160 BACK AT THE CAMP 160 Lazar runs from tree to tree, keeping up a steady stream of fire. He is surprisingly brave. Until A GRENADE flies out of the woods and lands at his feet, killing him instantly. The Assault Troops have begun to outflank them. Asael is suddenly in jeopardy. Sara sees the danger. MIRIAM GO! Miriam keeps their ATTACKERS pinned down as the two men race for new positions. Then she is hit. She keeps firing anyway, her finger locked on the trigger even as she is dying. More troops begin firing from their flank. Asael has no choice but to break off. They race into the woods. 161 BACK TO THE FLEEING GROUP 161 Tuvia hears the guns go silent. This, too, has meaning. 162 A RISE REVEALS THE IMMENSITY OF THE KRASNAYA GORKA SWAMP 162 Malbin stares at what lies ahead. MALBIN Oh, my God... TAN Revision - 9-10-07 100A. 162 CONTINUED: 162 TUVIA Are the others back yet? (Malbin looks stricken; he shakes his head) ..Asael? Malbin shakes his head once more. Asael is not coming back. Chaya begins to weep. Riva comforts her. SHULMAN We've got to keep going! BELLA The Germans will be here any minute! MALBIN Do we wait...a while? MORDECAI We could hide... MAN #3 I say, fight them here. MOTL Yes. Fight! SHULMAN That's crazy! Tuvia is in hell. If he waits for Asael, he risks them all being caught. Suddenly it all falls apart. Tuvia sinks to his knees as if his legs can no longer bear his weight. MALBIN Tuvia--? Tuvia can't speak. He has no more answers. Nothing to say. He stares at the impenetrable swamp. The end of the line. The sudden vacuum of leadership is felt by them all. They stare at one another, anxious and rudderless. WOMAN (ZOE) My father cannot make it. RONA There are snakes-- Tamara's newborn is crying. She tries to comfort it. An old woman stares at the swamp in terror. MAN #1 (FROHMAN) The children... SHULMAN We'll put them on our shoulders. TAN Revision - 9-10-07 100A1. 162 CONTINUED: (2) 162 BELLA Tuvia, what do we do? Oppenheim is petrified. Rona is crying. MALBIN TUVIA-- And still Tuvia is silent. More arguing. A general MURMUR of dread is rising. Malbin goes to kneel beside Shimon, who is covered in sweat -- undone by the forced march. MALBIN (CONT'D) What's wrong with him? SHIMON ...He... ..is... ..tired. Malbin hears something, looks up. FROM HIGH ABOVE - THE SPOTTER PLANE APPEARS They have been found. Lilka kneels beside Tuvia. TAN Revision - 9-10-07 100B. 162 CONTINUED: (3) 162 She takes his hand silently. LILKA COME-- He shakes his head. TUVIA You have a weapon? She shows him her revolver. He checks the clip, then looks into her eyes. TUVIA (CONT'D) Use it on yourself before you let them take you. She nods gravely. Suddenly a VOICE interrupts. VOICE Why are we stopping? Everyone turns. It's Asael. Back from the dead. He hands off a wounded comrade to Riva's care. ASAEL They're coming! Why aren't we moving? Tuvia looks up at him, lost. Almost helpless. ASAEL (CONT'D) We must keep going! TAMARA In there? RONA It is impossible! More murmuring. Asael raises his voice. ASAEL Nothing is impossible! What we have done is impossible! The murmuring quiets. Asael meets Tuvia's eyes. He is literally willing his older brother to be strong for them, as he has been, time and again. ASAEL (CONT'D) God will not part these waters. We will do it ourselves. RONA But how? GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 100B1. 162 CONTINUED: (4) 162 ASAEL Not by miracles. By our strength. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 100C. 162 CONTINUED: (5) 162 ASAEL (CONT'D) (turning to the man beside him) Take the rope from your pack. Now, you....give me your belt. SHULMAN We don't have enough rope. ASAEL We'll link arms. Make a chain. A human chain. MOTL What are you talking about? Tuvia is deeply moved. His little brother has become a man. Once more, he finds his voice. TUVIA Each person takes care of the other. .Give him your belt. Asael nods at Tuvia gratefully. The group is hushed, apprehensive. Then: ONE MAN Removes his belt and offers it to Asael. ANOTHER STANDS, HOLDING HIS BELT And then another. One by one they offer them. There is something quietly heroic in the gesture. Tuvia looks at the group, looks away, fighting back emotion. SALMON Revision - 8-18-07 100D-100E. 162A THEY WADE IN, WAIST HIGH 162A People link arms and hold on for dear life yet still they flounder. A man goes under, is pulled up. A harrowing undertaking. 162AA THE BELTS ARE ROPED ACROSS THE DEEP POOL 162AA People cling to it as they drag themselves, hand over hand. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 101. 162B SOMEONE CLIMBS OUT TO WALK ALONG THE BANK. 162B TUVIA No tracks on land. Get back in. It is almost impossible to make any progress. Especially when one is weak and malnourished. 162C IN A DEEP BOG 162C The mud sticks to their clothes, faces. Soon they are indistinguishable from their surroundings. When one person sinks in the muck, it takes three to get him back on his feet. The column slows. Tuvia gestures for them to keep moving. They can't. Literally cannot. He begins to physically push them on. Sometimes harshly. Eventually they are moving again. CUT TO: 163 A GHOSTLY LANDSCAPE 163 Gnarled bare trees shrouded in mist. They trudge forward, their expressions wan and empty. Tuvia find Malbin and pulls him aside. TUVIA How much farther? Malbin shrugs his shoulders. Who knows...? 163A THE WATER IS ALMOST HEAD HIGH 163A Parents hoist children onto their shoulders, hold weapons overhead as they claw at tall reeds to propel themselves forward, step by tortuous step. SHIMON clings to a tree. His wracking cough is terrifying and he is deathly pale. TUVIA Come... Shimon can't catch his breath, he just shakes his head, no. He can't go on. Tuvia half-drags, half-carries him onward. CUT TO: CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 102. 164 A SPIT OF LAND IN THE SWAMP - DUSK 164 They rest, eat what little food is left. A litter carrying Shimon is deposited on dry ground. He is barely alive. MALBIN Is he...? Tuvia shakes his head. It's only a matter of time. The Spotter Plane drones overhead. TUVIA Take off your glasses. Reflections. Tuvia moves off to check on the others. MALBIN Shimon, listen to me, the physical plane is just an illusion. Only the spiritual plane is real. SHIMON No. The physical plane is where man acts to redeem himself. MALBIN You've redeemed yourself enough, you should shut up now. SHIMON Look who's talking about shutting up... I need to tell you something. MALBIN What is it? SHIMON You shouldn't think so much. The world around you is beautiful. MALBIN This world? SHIMON Even this one. Tuvia has come to sit beside Lilka. She leans into him. TUVIA We're lost. LILKA No. ..No. She puts her arms around him. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 102A. 164 CONTINUED: 164 They hold each other and drift off to sleep. CUT TO: 165 AT NIGHTFALL - A SQUAD OF GERMAN SOLDIERS 165 sit around a campfire at the edge of the swamp. FROM NEARBY The LIGHTS of their fire can be seen flickering through the reeds as the ragged column MOVES SILENTLY past. TUVIA Not a sound. Pass the word. We watch as the ORDER is passed down the line. Parents hold hands over their childrens' mouths. Shimon is carried on an improvised litter made of branches. CUT TO: 166 A FOREST CROSSROADS 166 Panchenko and a few others are on horseback. Behind them the rest of the Partisans are marching away. Zus and the Jewish fighters are on foot, awaiting orders. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 103. 166 CONTINUED: 166 PANCHENKO You will hold this crossroads until the brigade has completed its retreat. Zus looks around at the position. ZUS For how long? Panchenko's orders are never to be questioned. PANCHENKO Until you are ordered to withdraw. ZUS And if we cannot hold the position? Panchenko looks at Gramov, who stands nearby cradling a submachine gun. PANCHENKO Comrade Gramov will enforce discipline, if necessary. Gramov smiles. The implications are clear: nobody retreats. PANCHENKO (CONT'D) You have served us well, Comrade. ZUS I am so honored, Comrade. Panchenko wheels his horse and gallops off. Zus and his men take cover in the woods. In the distance we can HEAR the unmistakable SOUND of approaching armor. Lova kneels beside Zus. LOVA What are we doing here? Zus? Half a mile down the road, A TANK rumbles into view. LOVA (CONT'D) Tell me. Who are we doing this for? With a shaking hand, Zus tries to light a Molotov cocktail but his matches are wet. He reaches into his pocket for more. Instead he finds the mezuzah that was once affixed to his family's door. As he stares at it, the SOUND of the approaching tank grows louder. BACK TO: YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 103A-105. 167 THE KRASNAYA GORKA SWAMP 167 empties at last into a shallow river. On the opposite bank is dry land, and beyond, the deep forest. And safety. The bedraggled group makes their way across. 168 OMITTED 168 GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 106-106A. 169 ON THE OPPOSITE BANK 169 Asael pulls people up onto dry ground. They lie there, freezing and exhausted. Some cannot control their shivering. SHULMAN What's next...Sinai? Tuvia can't help but laugh. Soon they are all laughing. It ripples throughout the group. Joyous. Contagious. An overwhelming feeling of relief. They are safe. Tuvia lies on the ground. All the adrenaline has suddenly left his body. Then Aron appears, tugging at his sleeve. Shimon is asking for him. Tuvia kneels down beside his teacher, whose eyes are closed. Malbin is weeping quietly. Who will he argue with? SHIMON .Tuvia... TUVIA Right here. Shimon is at the end. SHIMON ...Something...to say... TUVIA Shhhh... SHIMON ...no...please... I almost lost...my faith....but you...were sent..by God..to save us. TUVIA Ridiculous. SHIMON I know... ... But just...in case... .I thank....HIM... .and I thank you. He closes his eyes. It's too much for Tuvia. Hard as he tries, he cannot stop the tears from filling his eyes. GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 107. 170 SUDDENLY -- UP THE RIVERBANK 170 Trees begin to FALL OVER -- as if pushed by a dinosaur. A PANZER TANK emerges onto the banks, less than a quarter-of-mile away. ITS TURRET BEGINS TO SWIVEL The menacing gun turning in their direction. 171 THE GROUP IS CAUGHT OUT IN THE OPEN. 171 THE TANK ROARS FIRE. The first round EXPLODES among them. Several are killed. TUVIA Back to the river! He pushes people down. They cling to the banks, cowering. THOSE WITH WEAPONS take cover, using the embankment as if it were the lip of a trench. They RETURN FIRE -- old men, young women, even some children. 172 A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY ADVANCES 172 behind the tank, using it as protection. Aron kills one. But the Germans are well-trained. They direct a withering fire -- forcing the partisans to keep their heads below the embankment. BUT THE TANK IS UNSTOPPABLE It turns its attentions on the riverbank -- its first round SAILS OVERHEAD, sending up a huge geyser of water. But the next round PLOWS INTO THE EARTH, tearing a huge chunk of earth and killing two of the brigade. TUVIA grabs a satchel and begins filling it with grenades. He throws the satchel over Malbin's head, grabs his arm and races, crouching low, beneath the lip of the riverbank. Asael provides covering fire. So do Lilka, Chaya and the women alongside the men. UP AHEAD A stand of trees hides Tuvia from view as he climbs out of the river and heads into the forest. He pulls Malbin down just as A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY approaches and begins to set up a heavy machine gun. GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 107A. 172 CONTINUED: 172 Tuvia POPS UP behind them, spraying them with his submachine gun. He then turns the heavy machine gun on the infantry advancing behind the tank -- to devastating effect. But now, the tank turns its attention to Tuvia. Its machine gun begins to chew up the forest, forcing Tuvia to take cover. Without pausing to think, Malbin grabs a grenade from the satchel and races toward the tank. It falls pitifully short, exploding harmlessly as Malbin is cut down. DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 108. 173 TUVIA IS NOW ISOLATED AND PINNED DOWN 173 Bullets tear chunks out of trees as he tries to take cover. THE TURRET SWIVELS IN HIS DIRECTION It is only a matter of moments before he is dead. WHEN SUDDENLY FROM OUT OF THE WOODS Zus and the rest of Jewish fighters emerge, firing on the run. Without regard for his own life, Zus charges. The German infantry is caught in a cross-fire as the Bielski brigade climbs out the river, firing wildly. Zus guns down the tank commander manning the machine gun from the open hatch. Jumps onto the tank and DROPS A GRENADE inside. An EXPLOSION of BLACK SMOKE BILLOWS. Zus stands up amid the billowing smoke. He sees Tuvia who is staring back at him. 174 BOTH GROUPS MEET - THE DESTROYED TANK SMOLDERS NEARBY 174 Asael is the first to reach Tuvia, who is carrying the German assault machine gun. TUVIA Only weapons and ammunition! Spread the word. Tuvia hands him the machine gun. ASAEL Anything else? Tuvia looks at him. Is he fucking with him? Just a little. TUVIA Go on. Lilka is carrying a small child. TUVIA (CONT'D) Lilka, please help. We've got to get the injured into the forest. LILKA What about the dead? TUVIA Everybody gather your things! We have to get out of the open! Nearby, Aron removes the machine from the tank and hands it to Zus. Bella approaches. Zus embraces her. Tuvia seizes one of the German rifles. He yells to Shulman. TUVIA (CONT'D) Shulman! Weapons only! Tell them. DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 108A. 174 CONTINUED: 174 Shulman follows Tuvia's order. TUVIA (CONT'D) You've been promoted. Congratulations! Tuvia turns, sees Bella with Zus. They see him. Zus hands Bella the machine gun from the tank and approaches. TUVIA (CONT'D) Where is the rest of your unit? ZUS Good question. TUVIA You are going back? ZUS No. They look at each other. So much unsaid. No time to say it. TUVIA We've got to build a new camp. Zus nods. ZUS Perhaps you have room for one more? DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 109. 174 CONTINUED: (2) 174 Tuvia reaches out his arms and they embrace fiercely. 175 IN THE DEEP WOODS - LATER 175 They walk in silence. Lilka comes to walk beside him, resting her head on his shoulder as they walk. Tuvia looks up at the shafts of light slanting through the towering trees, as if allowing himself to appreciate its beauty for the first time. Suddenly, he stops, listening, puzzled. TUVIA Don't you hear it? ZUS What...? TUVIA Nothing. Isn't it beautiful? We HOLD on Tuvia. He has aged ten years in one. PINK Revision - 7-18-07 110. 175 CONTINUED: 175 But for now he allows himself a brief moment of satisfaction. We might even see the ghost of a smile. But it is short- lived as Asael appears by his side and we see concern once again clouding his face. Another problem to attend to. And as THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL AWAY he is already hurrying to catch up with the others. As they all disappear from sight into the sheltering darkness of the woods, these words appear on screen: THEY LIVED IN THE FOREST FOR TWO MORE YEARS. IN THEIR NEW CAMP THEY BUILT A SCHOOL, A HOSPITAL, A NURSERY. AND STILL MORE CAME TO FIND THEM. AT THE TIME OF LIBERATION, TWELVE HUNDRED WALKED OUT OF THE FOREST. DISSOLVE TO: 176 THE OPENING SCENE - NEW YORK CITY - 1982 176 Park Avenue. Traffic. More words on screen: ASAEL JOINED THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND DIED SIX MONTHS LATER. ZUS AND TUVIA EMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES. In the taxi, THE ELDERLY MAN thrusts his hand through the slot in the Plexiglas window separating him from the driver. ELDERLY MAN Here is money. I can get more. So much more. Take it, please. CAB DRIVER No, no... Indeed, when the CABBIE speaks, though the voice is older and somewhat frail, we recognize it as Tuvia's. ELDERLY MAN What else can I give you, do for you? AGED TUVIA Nothing, it isn't necessary. Tears stream down the elderly man's cheeks. ELDERLY MAN We are alive because of you. My children. His children. So many. .Thousands. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 111. 176 CONTINUED: 176 Behind them, HORNS are HONKING. This is New York City. AGED TUVIA Please, the traffic... ELDERLY MAN Bless you, Tuvia Bielski. May the Lord bless you and keep you all the days of your life. THE CAB PULLS AWAY FROM THE CURB INTO THE RAIN - MIDDLE-AGED SON Papa, who was that man? The Elderly Man watches the cab pull away, wiping his eyes. ELDERLY MAN That wasn't a man. That was an angel. As the cab pulls away, the CAMERA CRANES UP until it is lost in an anonymous sea of traffic. These words appear on SCREEN: TUVIA BIELSKI NEVER SOUGHT RECOGNITION FOR WHAT HE DID. HE DROVE A CAB IN NEW YORK CITY FOR TWENTY YEARS. TUVIA AND LILKA REMAINED MARRIED UNTIL HIS DEATH IN 1987. FADE OUT. www.vantageawards.com",

Doctor Katz says you'll outlive us all. Traffic isn't bad. We should be back in time to watch the Mets. He notices his father is STARING, wide-eyed, at the cabby's HACK LICENSE.

CUT TO: 2 A MAN RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE THROUGH THE WOODS. 2 Bombs EXPLODE all around as he passes dead bodies and BURNT- OUT VEHICLES. Without slowing he discards a WW II Red Army helmet, a field jacket, a heavy pack, anything that might impede his flight. He glances back up over his shoulder. The sky is filled with BOMBERS. He runs on. SALMON Revision - 8-18-07 2. 3 OMITTED 3 4 THE VILLAGE OF NALIBOKI 4 A typical Eastern European shtetl. LOCAL POLICE help German Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing squads, round up Jews. PEASANTS beat them with sticks as they are herded into lines. One man tries to run and is beaten. Others look on, or look away with indifference as they are loaded onto waiting trucks. 5 TWO MEN HIDE IN THE NEARBY WOODS (ZUS & ASAEL BIELSKI) 5 We study their faces: a turbulent portrait of impotent rage, terrible fear, overwhelming grief, and secret relief. ASAEL Where are they taking them? ZUS --Shveig! Shveig! ASAEL BUT-- ZUS Just shut up! Please... 6 AN ALLEY WAY IN NOVAGRUDOK 6 The man we last saw in flight (TUVIA BIELSKI) wearing the remnants of his uniform, slips down a cobble-stoned street. He ducks into a doorway as A PATROL passes by. 6A A REMOTE FARM 6A Zus and Asael move warily through a barnyard. A tethered dog BARKS furiously. A farmer challenges them. WALENCKI WHAT DO YOU WANT? Walencki brandishes a pitchfork. ASAEL Some food...? WALENCKI They are looking for you people. The two brothers glance nervously around. WALENCKI (CONT'D) Get away from here! GO! ZUS, the older of the two brothers, takes a menacing step toward the farmer but his younger brother holds him back. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 3. 6A CONTINUED: 6A ASAEL Zus. Let's go. As they retreat toward the woods, Zus warns the farmer. ZUS We'll be back. 7 A BOURGEOIS APARTMENT -- DAY 7 Tuvia is getting dressed as AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN -- his wife, RIFKA -- stands by the window, smoking a cigarette. TUVIA And no news of my brothers? RIFKA They are used to trouble, they'll be all right. TUVIA If you stay, you'll have to go to the ghetto. RIFKA I can get false papers and pass as a gentile. So can you. Tuvia shakes his head, no. He finishes dressing. Theirs is a relationship long past passion. RIFKA (CONT'D) Will you at least stay tonight? TUVIA I need to see to my family. Will you come? RIFKA To the country? No. CUT TO: 8 A MODEST MILL - LATER THAT DAY 8 A PAIR OF LEGS lie motionless behind a trough. Beyond, A MAN'S TORSO. Zus and Asael stare in mute horror. ASAEL Papa-- Gottenyu...

Candles lit. An open book. A NOISE from a cupboard. Zus grabs a hatchet. From the root cellar, a YOUNG BOY, 14, appears. His face is dirty and tear-streaked. They go to embrace him. ASAEL Aron. The boy (ARON) recoils. He is disoriented and WILL NOT SPEAK. 9A EXT. MODEST MILL - MOMENTS LATER 9A Loaded down with possessions, Asael hurries back to the woods. Zus pauses long enough to pry the mezuzah from the door. CUT TO: 10 THE FOREST AT DUSK 10 Aron stares mutely straight ahead. Asael is shaking uncontrollably and crying. Zus is at a loss what to do. ZUS Stop it... But Asael is lost in a confusion of grief and panic. ZUS (CONT'D) Stop it. STOP IT! Finally Zus grabs him in a gesture halfway between violence and comfort...and holds him as Asael rocks back and forth. CUT TO: 11 THE NALIBOKI FOREST AT DAWN - VIEWED FROM ABOVE 11 A million acres of dense, impenetrable woods and swamps. 12 ASAEL AND ARON SLEEP HUDDLED ON THE GROUND 12 The sound of a FOOTSTEP. They sit up in terror. TUVIA If I was a German you are dead. ASAEL Tuvia! Asael leaps up to embrace him as if he were salvation itself. ASAEL (CONT'D) Papa and Mama. They killed them. TAN Revision - 9-10-07 5. 12 CONTINUED: 12 Asael clings to him. Even Aron allows himself to be held. Tuvia hold them silently. Zus appears, hatchet in hand. ZUS Big brother returns. Tuvia and Zus look at each other warily. ZUS (CONT'D) You saw them? Yes. Tuvia saw them. Zus takes the mezuzah from his pocket, tosses it to Tuvia. ZUS (CONT'D) Welcome home. 13 LATER - THE NALIBOCKI FOREST - A LOAF OF STALE BREAD 13 is torn apart by filthy hands as they move through the trees. ASAEL Are you going back to the army? TUVIA There is no more army. Asael worships his big brother. ZUS Hope at least you killed a few. Tuvia just stares at him. ASAEL What is it like? To be in a war? TUVIA It wasn't war. It was something else. Zus eyes him carefully. TUVIA (CONT'D) Where is Sonia and the baby? ZUS Horodysze. Hiding in a cellar. I'll bring her when it is safe. Where is Rifka? TUVIA In Novgrudok. She wouldn't leave. ZUS You are still separated? TUVIA She is still my wife. YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 6. 13 CONTINUED: 13 ZUS Your rich wife. Zus chews with the open-mouthed relish of a peasant. ZUS (CONT'D) So why exactly have you come back? Tuvia just stares at him. The reason is obvious as he holds his younger brothers. ZUS (CONT'D) You have a plan? TUVIA No. Do you? CUT TO: 14 POURING RAIN - A NEW HIDE-OUT (CAMP #1) 14 Shivering and miserable, they are trying to start a fire. Asael's few remaining matches are sodden. TUVIA Is there anything left to eat? Only a few potatoes in Asael's bag. WORMS writhe among them. ASAEL Zus finished the last of the sausage. Tuvia glares at Zus, who glares back. Sibling rivals. ZUS Stankowicz' farm is closest. ASAEL He has dogs. ZUS Fuck the dogs. Wilencki then. TUVIA You think Wilencki is going to give us food? ZUS No. We take it. TUVIA How? ZUS We...Take...It. SALMON Revision - 8-18-07 7. 14 CONTINUED: 14 TUVIA And he tells the police. ZUS I have run from the police my whole life. Do you really think it's a good time to stop? A moment of decision. Who holds the balance of power? ASAEL We know these woods. They'll never find us in here. Tuvia looks at his brothers. He has been outvoted. CUT TO: 15 THE SMALL FARMHOUSE 15 where Zus and Asael first tried to get food. Asael waits outside, anxiously on guard. 16 INSIDE 16 The farmer (WALENCKI) who threatened them with the pitchfork sits eating a simple dinner. Zus and Tuvia burst in. Zus brandishes a hoe. ZUS We want food. Be quick about it! WALENCKI You again! ZUS NOW! WALENCKI Sure, sure. Take what you want... Tuvia begins to stuff provisions into a sack. ZUS Where is your gun, farmer? WALENCKI I have no gun. Zus grabs a dinner plate and SMASHES IT IN THE FARMER'S FACE. ZUS WHERE IS YOUR GUN? Holding his bloody face, the farmer cowers in fear. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 8. 16 CONTINUED: 16 WALENCKI Please... Zus kicks him. WALENCKI (CONT'D) I beg you... TUVIA ZUS-- ZUS He's lying. He kicks him again. The farmer begins to weep. ZUS (CONT'D) You're lying! Zus dumps the remains of the farmer's dinner onto him. ZUS (CONT'D) If I hit you once more, you will shit your pants. Twice and you will never shit again. The farmer knows Zus won't hesitate. WALENCKI Up there... Zus kicks the man aside. Above the stove is an old rifle. Zus grabs it, points it at the farmer. ZUS We were never here. CUT TO: 17 THE BROTHERS 17 running through the woods. Zus raises the rifle in triumph. TUVIA He was willing to help us. ZUS He's lucky I didn't crush his head. TAN Revision - 9-10-07 9. 17 CONTINUED: 17 ZUS (CONT'D) Fucking Polack. I've eaten shit from these people long enough! TUVIA This is your plan? To terrorize every anti-Semite in Belorussia? ZUS No. Some I will kill. CUT TO: 18 ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST 18 Aron has been left alone. He holds a STICK which he \"shoots\" like a gun -- kachew -- as he creeps from tree to tree. Aron freezes. SOMETHING is moving in the trees. He crouches. A dark blur. An animal? It moves off. He follows. The shape appears again. It's a SMALL GIRL, roughly Aron's age. Aron waves at her. The girl stares, then runs off. Aron hurries after her into a wooded grove, then stops short. A PILE OF NAKED CORPSES. Overflows a newly-dug trench. The small girl runs to A MIDDLE-AGED MAN with a crude Star-of-David sewn to his tattered coat. He holds an OLDER GIRL, 14, in his arms. Nearby, three or four OTHERS emerge from hiding. Starved, in tatters, the living waiting to die. CUT TO: 19 A CLEARING (CAMP #1) - LATER 19 where the three brothers gorge themselves on stolen food. Someone FARTS loudly. ZUS Ah... ASAEL You know what Papa would do when you did that at table... Tuvia smacks Zus on the head, taking on a gruff voice. TUVIA Peasant. TAN Revision - 9-10-07 10. 19 CONTINUED: 19 Tuvia imitates his father's criticism of Zus. Asael laughs. Zus can't help but laugh as well. Even in grief there is laughter. A glimpse of ties that bind them. ASAEL I can't believe Papa's dead. ZUS Bernicki. ASAEL The police captain? TUVIA We don't know he did it. ZUS He always had it in for Papa. TUVIA We don't know he did it. ZUS So we will go and ask him if he did. ASAEL Koscik has a pistol. He showed it to me once. ZUS One pistol isn't enough. We need rifles. Machine guns. TUVIA Machine guns? You're going to take on the whole German army? ZUS Just because you didn't... The SOUND of footsteps. Zus jumps up cocking the rifle. ARON emerges from the trees. And then, behind him, THE SURVIVORS he discovered among the corpses. THE MIDDLE-AGED MAN holds a teenage GIRL by one hand and carries his younger daughter. MIDDLE-AGED MAN The child is hurt. The brothers stare at him. Wary and unwelcoming. TUVIA Set her down. The man lowers the child to the ground. She isn't moving. MIDDLE-AGED MAN I am Avram Rubinski. This is my daughter. She-- The Germans-- GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 11. 19 CONTINUED: (2) 19 He cannot bring himself to say the words. OTHERS shuffle forward, still in shock, barely able to speak their gratitude as Tuvia offers chunks of bread and cheese. The man tries to feed his daughter. She is barely alive. Asael turns to Aron. Gently. ASAEL Where did you find them? Aron still won't speak. Asael addresses the other girl. ASAEL (CONT'D) Your sister is sick? LITTLE GIRL (RACHEL) They kept her for a week. We fill in the rest. ZUS (O.S.) TUVIA-- Zus has moved out of earshot. Tuvia joins him. ZUS (CONT'D) We cannot feed them. TUVIA I'll go ask Koscik for food. ZUS And the pistol. TUVIA And the pistol. Without another word, he starts off. ZUS Remember to say please. CUT TO: 20 A RUSSIAN-MADE MAHKAROV REVOLVER. 20 Koscik, a rotund, florid-faced Pole, hands it to Tuvia. KOSCIK I have only four bullets. BLUE Revision - 6-26-07 12. 20 CONTINUED: 20 TUVIA I cannot thank you enough. They sit in Koscik's warmly-lit kitchen. Koscik's WIFE stands silently by the stove, glaring at Tuvia. KOSCIK Your father was a good man. TUVIA He said the same of you. Tuvia can't help but notice Koscik's wife giving him the evil eye. Koscik produces a bottle of vodka. KOSCIK Ignore the bitch. To the dead. God rest their souls. Bitch-- Do you want vodka? His wife just glares at him. KOSCIK (CONT'D) I live with this, can you imagine? HEADLIGHTS sweep over the window. A CAR is fast approaching. KOSCIK (CONT'D) Hide yourself. ...The barn. 21 TUVIA HURRIES ACROSS THE COURTYARD AND INTO THE BARN. 21 22 IN THE LOFT 22 He climbs a ladder and is startled to find FIVE MORE MEN AND WOMEN in hiding. They stare in mute terror. 23 OUTSIDE THE BARN 23 Koscik greets A BELARUSSIAN POLICE CAPTAIN and his SONS as they exit the car. They speak in Russian, with subtitles: KOSCIK Working late, boys. POLICE CAPTAIN Hunting Jews. Our new bosses are very organized. Koscik offers the bottle. KOSCIK Hunting can work up a thirst. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 13. 23 CONTINUED: 23 POLICE CAPTAIN Fifteen in one day. The council is offering a year's free tax for every one you turn in. - KOSCIK A Jew is worth that much? Do you pay more for a fat one? They laugh appreciatively. 24 IN THE LOFT 24 A man COUGHS then shrugs an apology. Tuvia glares at him. 25 BACK TO THE COURTYARD 25 POLICE CAPTAIN Caught five of them hiding in a ditch. Smelled so bad I was afraid the Germans wouldn't want them. KOSCIK Maybe for a reduced price. More laughter. More vodka. POLICE CAPTAIN You know the Bielski's? KOSCIK Sure. POLICE CAPTAIN We missed two when we visited the parents. 26 IN THE LOFT 26 Tuvia listens to this casual talk of his parent's death. 27 BACK IN THE COURTYARD 27 POLICE CAPTAIN Anybody caught helping them is in for it. You know this, Koscik? KOSCIK Do I look like an idiot? Don't answer so quickly... More laughter. The Police Captain looks at his watch. Yawns. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 14. 27 CONTINUED: 27 POLICE CAPTAIN Been at it since dawn. The wife doesn't like these long nights. He tries to hand back the bottle to Koscik. KOSCIK Keep it. POLICE CAPTAIN Bribing an officer of the law? Maybe you have more of this black market vodka hidden in the barn? KOSCIK Take a look. And clean out the cow shit while you're back there. The policeman laughs and climbs back into the car. POLICE CAPTAIN You'll keep your eyes open, yes? KOSCIK Good hunting. 28 MOMENTS LATER - IN THE BARN 28 Koscik and Tuvia speak in harsh whispers. KOSCIK --If the laborers find them tomorrow, I will be denounced-- TUVIA What am I supposed to do with-- KOSCIK Take them into the forest-- TUVIA --And feed them how? I can't care for my own family. Behind them, several of the REFUGEES have emerged from their hiding place. They stare at Tuvia balefully. 29 MOMENTS LATER - BY THE ROADSIDE 29 The refugees are loaded with provisions. A young man, PINCHAS ZUCKERMAN, has a tethered GOAT. Another man carries a violin case. Koscik hands Tuvia another bottle of vodka. TUVIA Those men? They were the ones who killed my parents? GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 15. 29 CONTINUED: 29 Koscik doesn't want to tell him. Finally he nods, yes. KOSCIK You people. Why is it so fucking hard to be friends with a Jew? They embrace. TUVIA Imagine being one. Tuvia leads his motley band toward the woods. CUT TO: 30 A FOREST TRAIL - DAY 30 Tuvia leads them. He notices an OLD MAN staring at him. OLD MAN You sat in back. Tuvia just looks at him. OLD MAN (CONT'D) In school. I am Shimon H'aretz. TUVIA I thought you were dead. SHIMON I am at least half-dead. I heard them speaking of your parents. I am very sorry. Tuvia shakes his head. SHIMON (CONT'D) And the other brothers? What was his name, the wild one? TUVIA Zus. He's with the other two. SHIMON You are hiding here? In the forest? Tuvia nods. SHIMON (CONT'D) There has been trouble before maybe? With the police? Tuvia doesn't answer. DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 16. 30 CONTINUED: 30 SHIMON (CONT'D) So now you go to the forest. A wise choice. TUVIA For a dumb schoolboy, you mean. SHIMON My whole life I presumed to teach others the right way to live. I had no doubt: this is God's way, this isn't. You'll forgive me if recent events have somewhat shaken my resolve. TUVIA It is just like school, I don't know what you're talking about. Teacher...Come... Come. (gesturing to the FOLLOWERS) Please. CUT TO: 31 OMITTED 31 32 THE CLEARING - LATER THAT DAY 32 The new arrivals squat by a fire where potatoes are cooking in the ashes. Everyone shares from the soup pot. There aren't enough spoons to go around. Shimon offers Aron something to eat. SHIMON Here... You're not hungry? Aron doesn't respond. SHIMON (CONT'D) The little one does not talk? ASAEL He saw. Things. TUVIA, MEANWHILE stares fixedly as Avram digs his daughter's grave. The gun is still in his belt. Zus is constructing a shelter. ZUS I send you for food and you bring more mouths to feed. TUVIA You send me? ZUS Did you at least get the gun? DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 16A. 32 CONTINUED: 32 Tuvia shows him. TUVIA Only four bullets. ZUS Then we'll have to make them count. Zus heads for the food. Asael is trying to start a fire but the kindling is wet. SHIMON Here... Shimon takes a book from his coat, rips out pages covered in Hebrew and crumples them into the fire. They burst into flame. SHIMON (CONT'D) The Psalms have many uses. ZUS SITS AMONG THE NEWCOMERS watching as they eat hungrily. Tuvia stops near Avram DIGGING a grave before heading out of the camp. We realize Avram's daughter has died while Tuvia was away. THE SOUND OF DISTANT THUNDER. DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 17. 33 A LONE FARMHOUSE - DUSK 33 Tuvia stands in the driving rain, shaking. He stares at the lit windows. 34 INSIDE THE HOUSE 34 The POLICE CAPTAIN we saw earlier eats dinner with his WIFE and TWO SONS. They speak in Russian. WIFE You worked late. The man nods, his mouth full of food. WIFE (CONT'D) Tomorrow is Sunday. You have a day off, yes? POLICE CAPTAIN ...Fucking SS never sleeps... The door OPENS slowly. They all look up. YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 18. 34 CONTINUED: 34 Tuvia stands on the threshold, dripping wet, a spectral figure. He holds the pistol at his side. TUVIA You know who I am? The policeman says nothing. His wife is instantly terrified. One of the SONS stands. Tuvia turns the gun on him. TUVIA (CONT'D) Sit. The son obeys. The SOUND of the rain on the tin roof is deafening. Tuvia turns back to the Police Captain. TUVIA (CONT'D) And you know why I am here. POLICE CAPTAIN ...what are you talking about? TUVIA You have no idea what I'm talking about... POLICE CAPTAIN If they say find someone, I find him. It's my job. TUVIA To find Jews. POLICE CAPTAIN Or lose my job. TUVIA And it's a good job, isn't it? You like your job. POLICEMAN I was always fair with your family. ...Everyone knew you were smuggling this and that. But I looked the other way. ...Ask your father. TUVIA My father? You don't talk about my father... Tuvia places the pistol against the man's forehead. TUVIA (CONT'D) Down on your knees. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 19. 34 CONTINUED: (2) 34 TUVIA (CONT'D) ON...YOUR...KNEES...PIG! The policeman begins to weep. TUVIA (CONT'D) For my parents, David and Beila Bielski... for my brothers and all the others-- POLICE CAPTAIN Please.... I beg you... One of the man's SONS makes a move toward Tuvia. Tuvia SHOOTS him in the chest. His mother SCREAMS. The Policeman suddenly starts to stand. Tuvia backs away, shoots him. And then the other son. It is all over in seconds. 35 OMITTED 35 36 TUVIA STANDS THERE, FROZEN 36 The police captain's wife is prostrate and KEENING over her dead family in Russian. WIFE Kill me, too! Tuvia should indeed kill her, too. To avoid being identified. TUVIA Tell them who did this. CUT TO: 36A EXT. POLICE CAPTAIN'S HOUSE - DUSK 36A The rain still pours down on the house as Tuvia runs away. 37 A FOREST TRAIL - STILL RAINING 37 Tuvia pushes through dense forest. Branches rake his face. Finally he leans against a tree. We move CLOSE on his face. TUVIA Riboynoy shel oylam, riboynoy shel oylam... Lord of the universe, forgive me, I have murdered -- but they were monsters and did not deserve to live. DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 20. 38 NEXT MORNING - A LOW FOG CLINGS TO THE FOREST FLOOR 38 Zus awakens, sodden and stiff. He looks at the group, now numbering fourteen. People sleep huddled together: Asael holds Aron; Avram keeps his surviving daughter close. And there is Tuvia -- sitting by the fire. Zus takes the pistol from Tuvia's belt. Checks the cylinder. ZUS Only one bullet left. TUVIA His sons. Zus nods his approval. ZUS How was it? TUVIA What? ZUS To kill them. It was good, no? TUVIA Shut up. Tuvia stares into the fire. He is dirty and tired. Zus looks around. ZUS What are we going to do with these others? TUVIA I don't know-- ZUS The women will slow us down. And your old teacher-- TUVIA You're afraid he's going to beat you for forgetting your homework. ZUS We have to be able to keep moving, and quickly. TUVIA I agree. But they're here. They consider their predicament. DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 21. 38 CONTINUED: 38 TUVIA (CONT'D) We'll sleep farther up the trail. If anyone comes, they'll find them first. The gunshots will give us time to escape. ZUS Alright. But no more. TUVIA No more. CUT TO: 39 SEVERAL MORE REFUGEES 39 stumbling into camp behind Tuvia, who carries a heavy sack of provisions. Zus gives Tuvia a look. TUVIA I know. I know... Tamara, you remember Cousin Zus. Please, go sit down by the fire. And this is Lazar -- Isabel's youngest... Tamara is pleasant-looking but emotionally wounded. TUVIA (CONT'D) This is Isaac Malbin. From Minsk. Malbin is sweet-faced with little round Trotsky glasses. TUVIA (CONT'D) Asael, find them something to eat. ASAEL! Zus takes Tuvia aside. ZUS Tuvia, I have pity for them all, BUT-- TUVIA They are family. ZUS And how will we feed this family? TUVIA We'll water the soup. One of the new arrivals is a DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY. Tuvia and Zus watch her pass. Zus is particularly interested. ZUS And this one, is she family? TUVIA No. By the fire, the veterans pepper the newcomers with DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 A21. 39 CONTINUED: 39 questions.

Asael brushes Aron's hair. Rachel sits beside her grieving father. She looks at Aron. He looks back. Nearby, Tuvia and Malbin are building a shelter. Malbin is hopelessly inept. A wall COLLAPSES. TUVIA Fuck me! Have you never used a hammer? MALBIN Uh. No. TUVIA What is it you do, then? MALBIN I suppose...you'd have to say...I was...am...an intellectual. TUVIA This is a job? MALBIN I published a small magazine... actually a journal...well, more like a pamphlet. Zus passes them, his arm around the dark-haired beauty. ZUS Tuvia, this is Rona. Rona is my forest wife. TUVIA I see. Congratulations. Zus winks and walks past. Malbin and Tuvia watch them. MALBIN Interesting concept. TUVIA As long as his village wife stays in hiding. MALBIN Nice to know there are some things even Hitler can't destroy. DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 23. 40A CONTINUED: 40A Suddenly the camp grows quiet. TWO YOUNG MEN who have emerged from the forest, their clothes dirty and torn. One of them aims an army-issue rifle. ZUS Hello, boys, what can we do for you? YOUNG MAN #1 Food. We want food. Everyone remains still. Zus eyes his own rifle nearby. ZUS These little shits are holding us up. The Young Man motions his partner to take Zus's rifle. ZUS (CONT'D) You little shits have the balls to shoot me? In response, the young man CHAMBERS A ROUND. TUVIA This is all the food we have. You are welcome to share. ZUS No. YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 23A. 40A CONTINUED: (2) 40A ZUS (CONT'D) I want to see if this little shit will shoot me. You like shooting Jews, you little shit? YOUNG MAN #1 You are Jews? GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 24. 40A CONTINUED: (3) 40A ZUS No. We're the Gestapo, you little shit. TUVIA Come. Sit. Put down your guns. ZUS Or perhaps you'd prefer I shove them up your ass. TUVIA Where are you from? The young man glares at Zus. Then, to Tuvia: YOUNG MAN #1 Horodyszcze. The name freezes Zus in his tracks. His wife is there. PERETZ We haven't eaten in two days. My name is Peretz, this is Jacov. JACOV Two days ago there were three thousand Jews in Horodyszcze. Now there are fifty. Me and him, we hid in a wall. ZUS You know a woman there, Sonia Bielski? The men look at one another. JACOV We knew her. Zus can hardly bring himself to ask the next question. ZUS ...There was a child. Jacov shakes his head. Sorry. Zus leans his head against a tree. After a moment he begins to BEAT HIS HEAD against it until BLOOD pours down his face. ASAEL His family. Tuvia puts his arms around his brother. Zus's shoulders begin to heave. Soon his body convulses with deep wracking sobs. He is absolutely unself-conscious in his grief. GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 25. 40A CONTINUED: (4) 40A ZUS So many dead. TUVIA I know. ZUS Mama. Papa. Their heads are close together, their faces wet with tears. ZUS (CONT'D) Why not us? TUVIA I don't know. ZUS I thought they'd be safe. I should have been with them. TUVIA No. ZUS I could have protected them. Tuvia just holds him. He, too, is crying quietly. ZUS (CONT'D) Better to be rabbits? Hunted? Hiding? No... Zus breaks free of Tuvia's embrace and walks away. 41 LATER - BY THE FIRE 41 Jacov and Peretz are eating. Between ravenous bites-- PERETZ We are looking for partisans. JACOV What is the name of your otriad? Tuvia laughs ruefully. ASAEL What is an 'otriad?' TUVIA An armed brigade. JACOV We heard the Russians are beginning to organize. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 26. 41 CONTINUED: 41 TUVIA Here? JACOV And also in the Lipicanska. ASAEL Then we are the Bielski Otriad. You want to join? PERETZ The Russians are fighters. JACOV --But you need a gun to join them. Without a gun you are nothing. They sabotage railroads and kill Germans. ZUS (O.S.) We will kill all the Germans you can handle. Starting tonight. They stare up at him, his face a mask of blood and filth. ZUS (CONT'D) If you're not afraid to use that rifle. 42 MOMENTS LATER - JUST OUTSIDE OF CAMP -- 42 Zus is loading Wilencki's gun. TUVIA --we must get what we need without killing. We can't make more enemies-- Zus concentrates on opening the breach. TUVIA (CONT'D) --It won't bring your family back to life. Or Mama. Or Papa. ZUS Blood for blood. You had your revenge. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 27. 42 CONTINUED: 42 TUVIA And I can still see their faces. ZUS 'Vengeance is mine.' Who said that? TUVIA So this is God's work you're doing, Zussie? ZUS No. Only YOU can play God. Save a few lives, take a few others... TUVIA We cannot become...like them. ZUS If only... Are you coming with us or not? TUVIA Us? ZUS Peretz and Jacov. Asael, too. Tuvia looks over at Asael, who looks away. TUVIA You are making the decisions now? A stand-off. Zus stares back at him. The struggle for command has grown more obvious. TUVIA (CONT'D) We wait for dark. CUT TO: 43 A BURNING TRUCK 43 Lights up the night sky. A MAN comes running out of a tavern, the same man who loaded Jews onto trucks in an earlier scene. MAN My truck! WHO DID THIS TO MY TRUCK? Tuvia, Zus and the others appear out the shadows. TUVIA We did. GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 28. 43 CONTINUED: 43 The man stops short at the sight of their weapons. MAN Who are you? You don't understand. They made me give them my truck... Zus FIRES. Jacov and Peretz follow suit. The man goes down. They throw his DEAD BODY onto the burning truck. CUT TO: 43A A CLUSTER OF HOUSES - LATER THAT NIGHT 43A Zus and Peretz are backing out of an open doorway, FIRING BACK INSIDE AS THEY GO. From within, the sound of SCREAMS. ZUS THIS IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU COOPERATE WITH NAZI SCUM..! FACES appear furtively at the windows of nearby houses. Zus addresses the little neighborhood, delirious with joy. ZUS (CONT'D) WE ARE THE BIELSKI OTRIAD! WE ARE JEWS! YOU LIKE TO KILL JEWS! HERE WE ARE! WE ARE THE BIELSKI'S! TELL THEM! Tuvia looks around warily. This is getting out of hand. CUT TO: 44 A ROADSIDE DITCH - LATER THAT NIGHT 44 Tuvia and Asael lie in on one side of a road. Tuvia has looped ONE END OF THE WIRE around a post. 45 IN THE DITCH ON THE OTHER SIDE 45 Zus, Peretz, and Jacov WRAP THE WIRE to a tree. 46 UP AHEAD 46 The lights of a MOTORCYCLE, a GERMAN COURIER. 47 IN THE DITCH 47 Tuvia waits until the BIKE is almost upon them. Then he TIGHTENS the WIRE so it stretches INVISIBLY ACROSS THE ROAD. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 29. 48 THE MOTORCYCLIST IS GARROTED 48 by the wire. His bike goes sliding away as the Bielski's swarm him, KILLING HIM with the last bullet from the Mahkarov. ZUS rummages through the downed-bike's saddlebags. He finds a beautiful KNIFE and lifts it up triumphantly. PERETZ Look--! MORE HEADLIGHTS fast approaching. TUVIA Hide! Everyone! They all scramble back into the ditch, dragging the dead courier with them. 49 A GERMAN STAFF CAR 49 approaches. As its headlights pick up the downed motorcycle, it slows and pulls off to the side -- 50 DIRECTLY OVER THE DITCH 50 Where Tuvia and Zus are concealed. From within the car, we hear VOICES SPEAKING GERMAN. A YOUNG PRIVATE gets out and walks up the road to investigate. PRIVATE It's one of ours, but no one is here. Maybe he was drunk? From the car, an SERGEANT yells a reply. SERGEANT Move it off the road before the convoy passes. I'll report the sonuvabitch. As the soldier drags the bike off the road, AN OFFICER steps out of the car and lights a cigarette. He's followed by the Sergeant. He carries a Schmeisser SUBMACHINE GUN dangling from his shoulder. 51 IN THE DITCH - ZUS 51 can see the Sergeant's feet peeking out over the ditch. A STREAM OF PISS Cascades onto him. He tries to inch his body away... GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 30. 51 CONTINUED: 51 THE PISSING SERGEANT catches the flicker of MOVEMENT below, SEES Zus lying in the ditch. Stunned, he tries to zip up his fly. It catches. ZUS LEAPS UP brandishing the KNIFE. He's on the Sergeant before he can get the gun off his shoulder. Stabbing him through his greatcoat, the BLADE BREAKS OFF IN HIS HAND. MEANWHILE, THE LIEUTENANT drops his cigarette, reaching under his coat for a pistol. Tuvia TACKLES him. The GUN skids away. They roll around on the road, CLAWING, PUNCHING, BITING. Tuvia SLAMS the man's head against the pavement. 52 UP THE ROAD 52 The Private sees Asael and Peretz coming at him. Jacov follows with his rifle. The Private turns and runs down the road. They give chase. 53 FROM INSIDE THE CAR 53 Another OFFICER is in the back seat with A WOMAN. He reaches for his gun, stands up in the seat and begins FIRING WILDLY at Tuvia. TUVIA ROLLS UNDER THE CAR, avoiding the burst. MEANWHILE, ZUS USES THE HANDLE OF THE KNIFE to BREAK the Sergeant's nose. He RIPS the SCHMEISSER away, firing point- blank into the man, whose greatcoat CATCHES FIRE. INSIDE THE STAFF CAR The officer takes close aim at Tuvia, just as ZUS TURNS THE MACHINE GUN on the car BLOWING OUT THE WINDOWS, killing the Officer and the woman -- and saving his brother's life. 54 MEANWHILE, DOWN THE ROAD 54 Jacov fires at the Private, MISSES. The man keeps RUNNING. Jacov fires again. MISSES AGAIN. FINALLY his THIRD SHOT hits him in the leg. The Private keeps running. Limping now. JACOV I got him! Peretz and Asael can now catch up to the soldier. FROM FAR AWAY We SEE them knock the Private to the ground, KICKING him until Jacov catches up to them and FIRES A FINAL SHOT. GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 31. 55 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 55 Tuvia stands, out of breath. TUVIA Stupid! The gunfire could be heard for miles. ZUS He was pissing on my head. Zus is high from the killing, covered in the dead man's blood. He begins calling out orders. ZUS (CONT'D) Peretz, Jacov, check the car for guns... This one's yours. He presents him with the Schmeisser as if it were a trophy. Tuvia accepts it, checking the gun efficiently. ZUS (CONT'D) I'll check his pockets for more ammo. TUVIA Hurry--! AT THE STAFF CAR Peretz and Jacov emerge with two MACHINE-PISTOLS, several BOTTLES OF SCHNAPPS and a beautiful LEICA CAMERA. JACOV They were on their way to a party! They toss one bottle to Zus and another to Tuvia. 56 UP THE ROAD 56 Asael stands over the dead Private. He isn't much older than Aron. 57 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 57 ZUS rifles the pockets of the dead Sergeant for ammo. He finds cigarettes and the man's wallet. He opens it. ZUS Welcome to Belarus, herr Henkel. A CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS as Peretz and Jacov toast their victory. PERETZ Now we are real Partisans... GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 32. 57 CONTINUED: 57 JACOV To the Bielski Otriad! 58 SUDDENLY - ANOTHER SET OF HEADLIGHTS 58 are rounding the bend. Troop trucks. The Staff Car was leading A CONVOY. TUVIA Into the fields! RUN! Tuvia pulls Peretz off the road, but Jacov reloads his rifle and begins to FIRE at the approaching trucks. TUVIA (CONT'D) Jacov, NO! THE TRUCKS STOP. Troops pour off and begin RETURNING FIRE. Jacov is CUT DOWN by a MACHINE GUN. Peretz, Zus, and Tuvia race into the WHEAT FIELD. It's not clear if they can make it into the woods. A FLARE IGNITES OVERHEAD turning the wheat fields BRIGHT WHITE in flickering incandescence. Malbin is almost paralytic with fear. ASAEL doesn't know which way to run. He plunges into the WHEAT FIELD...but ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD. ONE OF THE TRUCKS drives forward, CUTTING HIM OFF, using its SPOTLIGHT to reveal him. FIFTEEN SOLDIERS start after him. 59 SEEN FROM ABOVE 59 We watch as they CONVERGE on him. TUVIA, ZUS AND PERETZ Have almost made it into the woods when PERETZ IS HIT. He falls. Tuvia and Zus pick him up and half-carry, half-drag him into the sanctuary of the forest. TUVIA Zus. His rifle. Zus races back to pick up Peretz's weapon. 60 ASAEL, MEANWHILE 60 has realized his mistake. He tries to circle back toward the woods but the SOLDIERS move to CUT HIM OFF. He is fast, but not fast enough. We realize he isn't going to make it. 61 IN THE WOODS 61 Tuvia and Zus look at the scene with mounting horror. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 33. 61 CONTINUED: 61 TUVIA Asael... He rips the rifle from Zus's hands. For a moment we think he's going to go back after him. Instead, he wedges the rifle into a tree-trunk and takes careful aim... THE SPOTLIGHT SHATTERS Plunging the field into darkness as the flare burns out. ASAEL seizes the moment and dives to his knees, disappearing from view and CRAWLING NOW rather than expose himself. AN IRRIGATION DITCH is nearby. Frantically he DIGS into the soft mud on its banks. As he scrapes his hands raw, he can HEAR his pursuers drawing near, CALLING OUT to one another. CUT TO: 62 THE FOREST CAMP - DAWN 62 A somber mood. Tuvia watches someone scrape at the porridge congealed in an empty pot. OTHERS stare listlessly into space. ONE MAN chews on a piece of leather, ANOTHER sucks on an old chicken bone. Zus, meanwhile, is in the middle of a nasty drunk from the captured schnapps. Nearby, Aron shares his ration of bread with Rachel. Little enough, but a connection is made. Peretz lies nearby. Malbin is trying to comforts him. There is nothing that can help him. Malbin looks to Tuvia. SHIMON They thought you were bringing food. Tuvia just stares at him. SHIMON (CONT'D) Did the farmers stop you? Still no answer from Tuvia. SHIMON (CONT'D) They had guns? Dogs? TUVIA No. SHIMON I don't understand. Tuvia says nothing. Nearby, a child cries in hunger. SHIMON (CONT'D) The Talmud says if you save a life you must take responsibility for it. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 34-34A. 62 CONTINUED: 62 TUVIA Again I have no idea what you are talking about. Around them, the beseeching eyes of so many hungry faces. SHIMON I think you do. VOICE You are the Bielski's? A MAN stands in the clearing. BEN ZION GULKOWITZ is tall, well muscled, a rifle strapped over his shoulder. ZUS How'd you get past the Lazar? BEN ZION Who? Zus stands unsteadily, then lurches into the woods, leaning on an occasional tree for support. He finds the erstwhile sentry --LAZAR -- ambling toward him. ZUS You shit! You worthless shit! Zus punches him, knocking him the ground. In a sloppy, drunken frenzy, Zus SLAPS him again. TUVIA Enough! ZUS He walked right by you! Someone could have been killed! Tuvia pulls Zus off him. TUVIA I said, enough! Get up! Get up! ZUS If we were real partisans he'd be shot. TUVIA He made a mistake! DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 35. 62 CONTINUED: (3) 62 ZUS MISTAKE! We cannot make mistakes! As Zus goes for Lazar again, Tuvia roughly PULLS HIM OFF. Zus goes flying, tripping over, landing on his ass. TUVIA That's right, Zus. No mistakes. Like last night. First they will torture Asael...and then they will hang him. Tuvia walks away, leaving his brother on the ground. 63 BACK IN CAMP 63 Tuvia rejoins them. Ben Zion looks up at him. BEN ZION You are Tuvia Bielski. TUVIA You know me? BEN ZION I am Ben Zion Gulkowitz. Ben Zion is besieged by questions about friends and family. MIRIAM Pardon me, you are from Vilna. My sister lives on Passaya Street. BEN ZION The SD came without warning. Hundreds were taken. No one knows where. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 36. 63 CONTINUED: 63 THE WOMAN begins to cry. MIRIAM My poor sister...dear God, no... Meanwhile, Peretz's MOANING ceases. A woman grumbles: WOMAN #1 We'd be better off in the ghetto... TAMARA At least here we are safe. LOVA There at least we had hope... SHIMON No. Here, we have hope. A FEW MORE join in, grumbling their dissatisfaction. Others take the opposite position. These are Jews, after all, and arguing is a revered sport and a pastime. It escalates. WOMAN #1 We are hungry! This is a defining moment for Tuvia. When at first he speaks, it is awkward, ineffectual amid the growing tumult. TUVIA I know we have no food. But tomorrow... tomorrow will be another mission. RONA Look what happened the last time. TUVIA That was a mistake! But the mistakes we made will not be made again! More objections. Tuvia must raise his voice to be heard. TUVIA (CONT'D) We could be here a long time. And we have to prepare. LOVA How? TUVIA Better security. Better at getting food and information-- (talking over their OBJECTIONS) --at making shelters. Whatever is needed. We all participate. We don't work against each other. At this he looks directly at Zus. Daring him to object. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 36A. 63 CONTINUED: (2) 63 TUVIA (CONT'D) I want to kill Nazis, too, but we...just...cannot afford revenge. Not right now. We cannot afford to lose friends like Jacov and Peretz. A small voice speaks up. ARON Or Asael. Everyone stares. It is the first time Aron has spoken. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 37. 63 CONTINUED: (3) 63 TUVIA Or Asael. We... We-- (trying to hold it TOGETHER) --cannot lose anyone. He looks from face to face. Filthy, ravaged, many of them with tears in their eyes. This is what they need -- leadership, faith, something to believe in. And gradually, his tentativeness and awkwardness is replaced by something else. A new voice. From deep inside. TUVIA (CONT'D) ...We will map out where we've been so as to not visit the same farms too often. And we take only from those who can afford to give, and leave those who can't alone. LOVA The poorest farmer has more than us. TUVIA True. But what I am saying is... what I mean is... We are not thieves. (his resolve growing with every word) Or murderers. We may be hunted like animals but we will not become animals. We have all chosen this -- to live free, like human beings, for as long as we can. Each day of freedom is an act of faith. And if we die trying to live, at least we die like human beings. His mission statement. A vision of their future. Everyone nods in mute acknowledgement. Zus lowers his head. The shift in power between them has occurred. Tuvia has emerged as the undisputed leader. CUT TO: 64 OMITTED 64 64A FALL IN THE FOREST 64A The trees take on color as if in celebration of their coming together. 65 KOSCIK'S FARM 65 All is quiet as Tuvia, Zus and Ben Zion watch from the woods. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 38. 65 CONTINUED: 65 TUVIA Now. They leave their cover and approach warily, guns at the ready. 66 OUTSIDE THE HOUSE 66 Koscik's wife looks up from her garden and glares at them. TUVIA Hello. She refuses to be flattered. In Russian: KOSCIK'S WIFE In the barn. 67 IN THE BARN 67 Zus calls out. ZUS Koscik, put your pants back on and leave those sheep alone. He steps into the shadows to find: KOSCIK HANGING FROM A THRESHING HOOK that has been driven through his chest. A sign attached to the hook reads (in Polish) \"JEW LOVER.\" CUT TO: 68 KOSCIK'S NEWLY-DUG GRAVE 68 is just beyond the barn. Tuvia finishes piling on the last shovelful of earth. Koscik's wife stares straight ahead. TUVIA I'm sorry. KOSCIK'S WIFE Come. 69 A ROOT CELLAR 69 dug into a hillside. Overgrown with tall grass it is undetectable. Koscik's wife opens the heavy door, revealing ASAEL, who emerges blinking into the bright light. TUVIA Thank God. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 39. 69 CONTINUED: 69 Zus pulls his lost brother into a mighty embrace. ASAEL Zus.... ZUSSIE... I can't breathe. Zus lets him go and Asael reaches back into the root cellar. ASAEL (CONT'D) Look. Two LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN -- BELLA and CHAYA -- emerge, tentative and scared. Though their dresses are dirty, it is obvious they were once expensive. Zus eyes them appreciatively. ZUS Asael... Well, well.. ASAEL Shut up. Look at this-- He has two more rifles and a large box of ammunition. Tuvia turns to Koscik's wife, deeply moved. TUVIA Thank you. KOSCIK'S WIFE Go. CUT TO: 70 A FOREST TRAIL 70 They head for home. Zus walks beside Bella. BELLA --and then we fell into this horrible bog. Chaya saved me. Honestly, I can't swim at all. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 40. 70 CONTINUED: 70 ZUS Then I will teach you! BELLA We must have got lost a dozen times. I was absolutely resigned to die. ZUS No... BELLA Tell him, Chaya. Was it not the absolute worst? And that farmer, Mr. Koscik, kept making the most vulgar jokes, he said any girl who-- As they continue out of earshot, it appears as though Zus would be happy to listen for hours. DISSOLVE TO: 71 A TOWERING PINE FOREST 71 Aron and Rachel are walking through the woods. For a brief moment, viewed through the eyes of the young, we see these woods as a magical place. Strange mushrooms, gnarled roots, an enormous spider's web glistening with dew. 72 THE CAMP HAS BEGUN TO SHOW PROGRESS 72 Sentries are posted. Zus expertly helps with the building a bunker (\"zemylanka\"). There's a more permanent kitchen, a wash trough, a clothesline. Pinchas tends his goat. Though primitive and raw...a haven. SHIMON AND MALBIN ARE DIGGING A HOLE Their bickering will become for them, as time goes on, a sport and a pastime. MALBIN You're trying to tell me all politics is meaningless. SHIMON In the West a monster with a little mustache, in the East a monster with a big mustache. This is all I need to know about politics. MALBIN Your messiah will have a mustache, too, and a full beard. SHIMON No. The messiahs are all in politics, and they're killing us. Zus unloads two cut and stripped trees. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 40A. 72 CONTINUED: 72 ZUS What's killing me is all your talking. Back to work. Malbin and Shimon go back to work. MALBIN And Roosevelt? He has no mustache. SHIMON My life in these woods is much easier because of Mr. Roosevelt, thank you. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 41. 73 WALKING THROUGH THE CAMP TUVIA AND ASAEL 73 review their plans. TUVIA We need to know what's going on in the villages, how the Germans patrol, who the informers are-- He realizes that Asael is not fully concentrating; instead he is watching as Chaya walks past. TUVIA (CONT'D) Are you listening to me? ASAEL Yes. TUVIA What's her name? ASAEL Chaya. [I believe.] TUVIA CHAYA! He waves as Chaya turns to look in their direction. Asael smiles, embarrassed. TUVIA (CONT'D) So talk to her. ASAEL I hardly know her. TUVIA You spent three days in a cellar! Asael blushes, returns the focus to their prior conversation. ASAEL Malbin says the Piznarksi granary is full. We need two guns at least... TUVIA Whose turn to go? ASAEL Zus. TUVIA You go along, just to make sure he understands my orders. Asael nods. TUVIA (CONT'D) Go on...Go! DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 A41-41A. 73 CONTINUED: 73 Asael heads toward Chaya. 74 NEAR A SHED ROOF - BEN ZION 74 We notice a FEW NEW FACES. Their number has exceeded twenty. Among them are two lumbering, dark-skinned men, ARKADY and MOTL LUBCZANSKI. Ben Zion is showing Lazar and the other newcomers how to clean a weapon. BEN ZION This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword. You fix the patch to the rod-- They do as he instructs. BEN ZION (CONT'D) --then run it through the barrel... and don't lose the patch in the BARREL-- Lazar looks up, sheepishly. LAZAR I lost my patch. ARKADY LUBCZANSKI whispers contemptuously to his brother, MOTL... ARKADY LUBCZANSKI The village idiot. Zus shoves Arkady out of the way and approaches Lazar, who cowers. But rather than abuse him, Zus removes the patch from the rifle and hands it back to him. LAZAR Thank you, Zus. ZUS It's nothing. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 42. 75 OMITTED 75 76 A ROADSIDE - NEXT DAY 76 KISSELY is a MILKMAN with bright red hair and a bushy mustache. He leads a horse-drawn CART laden with milk cans. ZUS AND THE OTHERS rise up out of the ditch. In Russian: ZUS Good morning, friend. Getting an early start to market? Could you possibly spare us a bit of milk? Zus' tone is belied by the rifle in his hand. KISSELY This is what I'm required to give the Germans. If I don't meet my quota they'll shoot me and my family. Zus is tempted to shoot him himself. ASAEL Leave half. He can't go to the Germans empty-handed. Zus glares at Asael. ASAEL (CONT'D) Tuvia's orders. Zus shakes his head, climbs onto the wagon and begins removing cartons. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 43. 76 CONTINUED: 76 ZUS We are so grateful, comrade, for your cooperation. What a lovely coat. Is that a fur collar? CUT TO: 77 ZUS, NOW WEARING THE MILKMAN'S COAT 77 joins the others lugging milk cans along the forest path. LAZAR (V.O.) HALT! WHO GOES THERE! Zus shakes his head. Lazar stands, pointing his weapon. ZUS Lazar, you can see it's us, you idiot. You only ask, 'who goes there' when you don't know who it is. LAZAR Sorry, Zus. 78 THE CAMP 78 is a beehive of activity. Shimon and Malbin are digging. MALBIN Even Spinoza said existence can be substantiated by empirical evidence. SHIMON All your secular learning, yet you know nothing of life. MALBIN How can you say this? Learning is my life. SHIMON And for every fact that goes in your head, another comes out your rear end. CHAYA and BELLA receive the bounty from the foragers. BELLA Milk, eggs -- Chaya, our brave men have brought us a feast! ZUS Blintzes! You will make me blintzes! She bestows her best smile upon him. 79 BY THE FIRE 79 New arrivals are being shown around by Ben Zion. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 43A. 79 CONTINUED: 79 A MAN and WOMAN cry out with joy at an unexpected reunion. DOUBLE PINK Revision - 9-27-07 44. 79 CONTINUED: (2) 79 ARKADY LUBCZANSKi approaches Chaya. ARKADY I don't think we've been properly introduced. Arkady Lubczanski. CHAYA Hello. ARKADY You are Chaya? CHAYA ...Yes. ARKADY You are getting along all right? Anything you need? An extra blanket? CHAYA Oh. Well... Yes, that would be nice. ARKADY You'll have it by tonight. Something nice and soft. I couldn't help but notice you don't have a husband yet. CHAYA Yet? CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 44A. 79 CONTINUED: (3) 79 ARKADY Most of the woman have already chosen. They haven't told you about this? DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 45. 79 CONTINUED: (4) 79 CHAYA No. But thank you for explaining it. She hurries away. Malbin sits down wearily beside Shimon. MALBIN Descartes at least provided for the subjective nature of experience. He takes a spoon from his sock. SHIMON Yes. You annoy me therefore I exist. MALBIN You are not eating? SHIMON By my best calculation, today is High Holiday. I am fasting. Malbin can't believe this. He rolls his eyes and digs in. One of the NEWCOMERS has brought a violin. He begins to play. A bittersweet melody. People stop talking and listen, eyes filling at this reminder of a sweeter, civilized time. Ben Zion has left the new arrivals and approached Tuvia. He looks grave. Tuvia immediately knows something is wrong. TUVIA What is it? BEN ZION The new ones, they are from Novagroduk. Your wife-- Tuvia tenses. Ben Zion hesitates... BEN ZION (CONT'D) They say...She was killed last week. I'm sorry. Tuvia nods. No outward display of grief. An awkward moment. TUVIA Thank you for telling me. We have to dig a trench around the new zemylanka. If it rains I'm afraid water will seep in. Tuvia clearly cannot deal with his news. BEN ZION I'll see to it, then. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 46. 79 CONTINUED: (5) 79 Tuvia nods and walks away. CUT TO: 80 ARON AND RACHEL WALK THROUGH THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS 80 Cathedral light cuts through the trees forming visible shafts. ARON Jacob's ladders. Like in his dream. Asael says you can see the angels. They walk on, eventually coming upon RAILROAD TRACKS. A TRAIN is rounding the bend, headed in their direction. RACHEL Can we stay to watch? ARON If we hide. They move back into the trees as the train NEARS: a slow- moving engine pulling a line of WOODEN CATTLE CARS. RACHEL Is that a Nazi train? ARON If we had some dynamite we could blow the shit out of it. RACHEL (with undisguised AWE) ...Just like your brothers. Aron can't help but be pleased by this notion. Then, as the train passes, they can see HANDS gripping the small barred windows. And every now and then a gaunt, desperate FACE. They stare in astonishment. CUT TO: 81 OMITTED 81 SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 47. 81A UNDER A SHELTER -- CONTINUOUS 81A Tuvia sits alone. Outside, the SOUND of the violin continues. Shimon comes to sit beside him. SHIMON I am sorry for your loss. Tuvia nods. He is deep inside himself. SHIMON (CONT'D) Do you want to say the Kaddish? When at last Tuvia speaks, it is almost to himself. TUVIA She was a beautiful woman. But cold. Not a day went by she didn't remind me I wasn't a good provider. For years it wasn't really a marriage at all. And now... He lowers his head. All Shimon can do is sit beside him. 82 THE PERIMETER OF THE CAMP - CONTINUOUS 82 Bella takes Chaya aside. BELLA You have lipstick? Please, I know you have some left. Chaya digs in her pocket and produces a tiny remnant. Bella dabs it on and casually approaches Zus, who is on guard duty. BELLA (O.S.) (CONT'D) May I join you? ZUS Of course. BELLA You get lonely out here? ZUS I like the woods. LAUGHTER and MUSIC waft through the trees. BELLA I'm a little scared out here. Zus knows an opportunity when he sees one. He offers her a drink from his bottle of vodka. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 48. 82 CONTINUED: 82 BELLA (CONT'D) I've never tried it. ZUS Go ahead. She drinks, refuses to grimace. Drinks again. Zus laughs. - Bella touches the rifle in his arms. BELLA Why is there a rule against women having guns? ZUS There aren't enough for the men. BELLA Women need guns, too. ZUS What for? BELLA For protection. ZUS Women have men for protection. Bella bites her lip. She's a virgin but also realistic. BELLA I want protection. She steps closer and takes Zus's hand...under her coat...onto her breast...never taking her eyes off him. BELLA (CONT'D) You will take good care of me? You will be my commander. 83 OMITTED 83 84 MEANWHILE - DEEP IN THE FOREST 84 Aron and Rachel are walking back from the train tracks. Suddenly he senses movement, freezes: ARMED POLICEMEN are advancing through the trees. Aron and Rachel bury themselves beneath piles of leaves until the police pass by, then he grabs her hand and dashes OFF-- ARON RUNS through the woods like a deer. She follows. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 49. 85 IN THE CAMP 85 He bursts in, SCREAMING. ARON MEN WITH GUNS! Chaos. People panic, search for family members, grab whatever they can carry, ZUS AND BELLA emerge from the woods where they have lain together for the first time. He grabs his rifle. TUVIA tries to maintain order. TUVIA ONLY FOOD AND GUNS! FOLLOW ASAEL! Asael clutches Chaya's hand. Rounding up others. ASAEL Don't panic. THIS WAY!. GO. ZUS QUIET! NOT ANOTHER WORD!!! THE POLICEMEN begin FIRING. TWO of the group are KILLED. Tuvia roughly pushes people deeper into the woods. TUVIA Lova, Ben Zion -- stay with us. Asael, keep them moving. Don't stop! THE POLICEMEN enter the camp. A submachine gun RAKES a shelter. KISSELY has found the escape trail into the woods. KISSELY This way-- 86 THE FOREST IS DEATHLY STILL 86 Tuvia and Zus usher the group across the river and up the embankment. TUVIA Go! Go! Move! Isaac, keep them moving! Zus, Asael, Ben Zion... Tuvia motions for them to take defensive positions while the others escape.- The policemen emerge hurriedly through the trees and begin crossing the river. SHOTS rings out. A Policeman goes down. The German Soldier is shot in the leg. They are dragged from the water. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 49A. 86 CONTINUED: 86 An edgy silence. From the trees a VOICE calls out in Russian-- DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 50. 86 CONTINUED: (2) 86 VOICE (ZUS) LEAVE NOW AND WE WON'T SHOOT THE REST OF YOU! POLICEMAN DON'T BE A FOOL. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF US! ZUS THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF US! WHO IS THE FOOL? The policemen exchange apprehensive looks. TUVIA WHERE ARE YOU FROM? POLICEMAN KARELITZ! The confrontation changes languages. BEN ZION I'M FROM KARELITZ, TOO. I LIVED BY THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE. POLICEMAN MAYBE I KNOW YOU. SHOW YOURSELF! BEN ZION YOU FIRST! Derisive laughter from the trees. POLICEMAN Give us Bielski and the rest of you can go free! Behind a tree, Tuvia is surprised by the mention of his name. TUVIA You are from Belarussia, pig! Why do you work for the Germans against your own people? KISSELY For the same reason you steal from the poor. To survive. ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT. Kessely is hit in the arm. KISSELY (CONT'D) Shit. ZUS Next one is to the head! DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 51. 86 CONTINUED: (3) 86 TUVIA Soon it will be dark... See how you find your way home then! The policemen are having similar thoughts. SUDDENLY - A POLICEMAN BREAKS AND RUNS AWAY Soon it's a full-scale retreat. AFTER A MOMENT Tuvia, Zus, Lova & Ben Zion emerge. Zus picks up the dead German's machine pistol. TUVIA (CONT'D) They'll be back. We have to find a new camp. ZUS Next time just draw them a map. TUVIA What does that mean? ZUS It means -- we should have killed the fucking milkman. Your policy of diplomacy is shit. Zus is breathing hard, full of the adrenaline of battle. ZUS (CONT'D) ...Two are dead. Winter is coming and now we have no shelter. Why? Because you don't have the stomach to do what must be done. He walks away. CUT TO: 87 OMITTED 87 DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 52. 88 THE NOVEMBER WIND WHISTLES THROUGH THE BARE FOREST (MONTAGE) 88 as the group trudges along -- weighed down by cooking gear, food, guns, etc. Asael takes the iron cauldron from Chaya. Zus and Bella walk side-by-side. Pinchas leads his goat. MALBIN Where is he taking us? My feet are going to fall off. SHIMON A great rabbi once said, \"wherever I go, I am always going to the land of Israel.\" MALBIN Well, maybe rabbis should give better directions. Tuvia walks alongside but apart. CUT TO: 89 A HILLSIDE 89 The group is sprawled on the ground. Four people share a single cigarette. Shimon and Malbin hardly have the energy to argue. Pinchas feeds his goat. Tuvia walks among them. TUVIA Rest and eat. I need volunteers for a scouting party. Zus raises his hand. Tuvia nods in grudging gratitude. However mixed his feelings, Zus can always be counted on. CUT TO: 90 A FORK IN THE TRAIL 90 Tuvia looks at Zus, who shrugs. They are in unfamiliar territory. As they move cautiously forward: A MAN IN A RED ARMY TUNIC steps into the path, holding an automatic rifle. He WHISTLES softly. More ARMED MEN materialize, surrounding them. GRAMOV WHO ARE YOU? Tuvia instantly grasps the situation. He salutes. TUVIA A brigade of independent fighters searching for our comrades. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 52A. 90 CONTINUED: 90 Zus almost does a double-take at Tuvia's bluff. GRAMOV What brigade? YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 53. 90 CONTINUED: (2) 90 TUVIA We belong to the Bielski otriad. GRAMOV We know of you. Jewish bandits. Zus's finger tightens on the trigger of his submachine gun. ZUS I'll take the two on the left... Tuvia maintains his composure. TUVIA I'm sure we can clear up this misunderstanding with your commander. CUT TO: 91 THE OCTOBER OTRIAD BASE 91 A primitive tent camp. RUSSIAN PARTISANS move about, quiet and cold-eyed men wearing remnants of Red Army uniforms. Zus can't help but be impressed by the array of weaponry. VICTOR PACHENKO emerges from a tent. A former lieutenant, dashing in a fur cap and long officer's coat. He addresses them in Russian. VIKTOR I am Viktor Panchenko, commander of the October otriad. We have had complaints of a Jewish gang stealing from villages loyal to us. How do you respond to these charges? TUVIA When you take food it is from loyal supporters. When we do, you call it stealing. VIKTOR We are soldiers. TUVIA And we fight a common enemy. The motherland doesn't distinguish between Jews and non-Jews. Viktor is amused by this bit of Soviet dogma. VIKTOR But Jews do not fight. DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 54. 91 CONTINUED: 91 TUVIA These Jews do. Viktor appraises Tuvia for a moment. VIKTOR We will see. Select your best fighters and send them to us. Zus looks at Tuvia, knowing he has no choice. TUVIA We are honored to be of service. Tuvia and Zus SALUTE and head back the way they came. ZUS So we're partisans now. TUVIA As if we have a choice. CUT TO: 91A NEW CAMP (CAMP #2) 91A Has taken root. People hard at work building zemylanka. 92 THE NEW CAMP (CAMP #2) 92 Tuvia and Malbin are working together on a new bunker. Malbin expertly nails a header across a doorway. TUVIA (throwing a smaller HAMMER) Here. MALBIN If my friends at The New Socialists' Club could see me now... I haven't read a book in months. TUVIA I haven't read one in years. Malbin looks up from his work. TUVIA (CONT'D) I wasn't a very good student. You can ask Shimon. MALBIN .I did. Tuvia laughs ruefully. Considers him for a moment. TUVIA Yet you accept me as Commander. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 55. 92 CONTINUED: 92 Malbin thinks about it for a moment. MALBIN Who else? Tuvia nods. Good point. They continue working. MALBIN (CONT'D) Might I make an observation? Tuvia gestures, go ahead. MALBIN (CONT'D) We need to be strong, but-- TUVIA ...But--? MALBIN Other things are important, too. TUVIA Such as? Malbin tries to think how best to put it. MALBIN Community. Tuvia considers the word. As if trying it on for size. TUVIA You have more ideas? About all this? MALBIN ...A few. TUVIA I'm listening... 93 MEANWHILE, THE WOMEN WATCH AS ASAEL LEADS IN NEW ARRIVALS 93 BELLA More mouths to feed. RONA More young bodies to keep us warm. One ot them, a young man, YITZHAK SHULMAN, RIPS the yellow Star-of-David off his coat and kneels to KISS THE GROUND. SHULMAN Which one is Tuvia Bielski? Someone points Tuvia out. Shulman hurries over and kisses Tuvia's hand. Zus is drinking nearby with his cronies. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 55A. 93 CONTINUED: 93 SHULMAN (CONT'D) None of us knew if you really existed. I am from Baranowicze. They are going to liquidate the ghetto. Chaya bursts into tears. Asael puts his arm around her. CHAYA My parents-- Zus catches Tuvia's glance to Malbin. Tuvia turns back to Shulman. TUVIA We'll do what we can. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 56. 93 CONTINUED: (2) 93 Shulman tries to kiss Tuvia's hand once again, but Tuvia takes his hand, instead, and shakes it. CHAYA looks deeply into Asael's eyes. CHAYA You will help my parents? ASAEL I...I... CHAYA I've seen you looking at me. If you were to rescue them, I would do... anything...you-- Asael is completely undone by the starkness of this. ASAEL No. I mean, yes. All right. 94 ZUS CATCHES UP TO TUVIA 94 and grabs him as he walks away. Their hushed tones belie the growing chasm between them. GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 57. 94 CONTINUED: 94 ZUS And what exactly does that mean, 'do what we can.' TUVIA We must send for whoever is left alive. ZUS And if it is a hundred? Six hundred? TUVIA Then we will provide. ZUS And when the Germans follow these hundreds and slaughter us. TUVIA I won't let that happen. Tuvia exchanges a glance with Malbin. Zus catches it. He has sensed Malbin's growing influence. ZUS You won't let that happen. TUVIA No. I'll bring them out myself. ZUS From the ghetto. TUVIA Yes. ZUS Pan Tuvia. Rabbi Tuvia. Allow me to kiss your hand... Tuvia tries to pull his hand away, but Zus holds him. ZUS (CONT'D) You think Pachenko wants hundreds more of us in the forest? TUVIA I cannot have you contradicting me... Not when others are around. Our family must stick together. TAN Revision - 9-10-07 58. 94 CONTINUED: (2) 94 ZUS And who is it that's risking our family, and for what? For the sake of these-- (gestures at the new ARRIVALS) --Malbushim. TUVIA Don't call them that. ZUS That's who comes to us from the ghetto. Empty clothes. Bloodsuckers. TUVIA They are people. Jews. ZUS Pretentious Jews. Jews who stuck up their noses and wouldn't give us the time of day when we passed them on the street. Jews who went out of their way to keep their daughters locked away from our dirty hands. You think your old teacher will give you a good grade because you saved his worthless ass! They accept you as their leader only because they are too weak and full of shit to help themselves. TUVIA --What about Bella? Tuvia looks over at Bella, who is anxiously watching. TUVIA (CONT'D) --You think she'd be with you if it wasn't for what is happening here? Zus glares at him, but tries to control himself. TUVIA (CONT'D) --Is it love Zus? DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 59. 94 CONTINUED: (3) 94 Zus is sick of talk. He PUNCHES Tuvia in the face. Tuvia is rocked but still he goads his brother. TUVIA (CONT'D) You are the man of her dreams? The Romeo of Novagrudok? Zus can't take anymore. He charges Tuvia, who sidesteps and SLAMS him in the gut. All the frustration of the past months, not to mention years of sibling rivalry, translates into fists and elbows. Ben Zion moves to break it up. Tuvia and Zus turn on him. ZUS Is this your business? Zus gains the upper hand and starts to beat the crap put of Tuvia. Finally, in desperation Tuvia rolls away and picks up a rock. He is about to slam it into his brother's head when suddenly he stops himself. The two brothers look at each other, both breathing heavily -- realizing that they have crossed some line. ZUS (CONT'D) Ben Zion. Krensky. Lova. Israel. Let's go. We are going to join the real partisans. He looks at Asael. ZUS (CONT'D) Are you coming? Asael looks at one brother, then the other. Once again, he is in the middle. He looks at Chaya, then back at Zus. ASAEL No. ZUS Good. I'll dance at your wedding. He stops by Bella's side, touches her arm, then disappears down the trail. The others follow. CUT TO: 95 THE OUTSKIRTS OF NOVOGRUDOK 95 Tuvia and Asael feel naked outside the safety of the forest. In the distance the city looms. 95A THE STREETS OF NOVOGRUDOK 95A Tuvia and Asael pass by the barbed wire and machine-guns of the guards and dogs manning the barrier to the ghetto. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 59A. 96 THE WALLS OF THE NOVOGRUDOK GHETTO 96 Tuvia and Asael climb over a dilapidated wall. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 60. 97 THE DESERTED STREETS OF THE GHETTO 97 People peer out from behind shuttered windows. Others hurry to get off the street. Tuvia consults a hand-drawn map. TUVIA This way. 98 OMITTED 98 98A EXT. FOREST - DAY 98A Zus, Lova and Ben Zion march alongside the Russians Partisans. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 61. 99 AN APARTMENT IN THE GHETTO - DAY 99 that might once have been home to a family-of-four now HOUSES fifteen. Tuvia and Asael are deep in conversation with several ELDERS of the ghetto Council ELDER #1 We are not so naive as to believe they won't kill some of us. But all the Jews? It makes no sense. They need us to work. In the factories. The labor camps. Tuvia notices A PRETTY GIRL standing on a chair in order to hear. Her name is LILKA and we will soon come to know her. YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 62. 99 CONTINUED: 99 TUVIA There are rumors. Of death camps. ELDER #1 We too have heard of such places. But have you seen them yourself? Can you tell me, with absolute certainty, that we are not just as likely to die out there with you in the woods with Winter coming on...? Someone WHISTLES from the street below. A tense moment. Another whistle. All clear. ELDER #1 (CONT'D) --Do you think we haven't all considered running away? For every one that leaves they kill twenty. How can I sacrifice thousands for the sake of a few?\" Tuvia looks at them, rubbing his face in concentration. TUVIA What if we were to take all of you? ELDER #1 The old, the sick? There are thousands. How will we live? TUVIA We will protect you. We have made alliances with the Russian Partisans. ELDER #1 They are as bad as the Nazi's. You are too young to know the pogroms-- DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 63-63A. 99 CONTINUED: (2) 99 Tuvia SLAMS HIS FIST on a table. TUVIA YOU WANT TIME? Fine, I give you a day. A month. Maybe a year. To live! Your daughter is out there with us. Your husband is waiting for you. An old orthodox RABBI stands nearby. TUVIA (CONT'D) Rabbi? RABBI We...are waiting for God. Tuvia looks at him in disbelief. Such madness is incontrovertible. A suspended moment. LILKA I am going. This breaks the log jam. Several others join in, \"We are coming,\" \"Us, too,\" etc. Tuvia nods his acknowledgment. CUT TO: 100 A COURTYARD IN THE NOVOGRUDOK GHETTO - NIGHT 100 A crude tunnel has been dug through a ghetto wall. PEOPLE squeeze through into the adjoining alley. Behind them, a hundred more await their turn. Out in the alley, Asael stops them momentarily as a car goes by at the end of the street, then gives the all-clear. Tuvia takes Lilka' hand and helps her pass through. Their eyes meet for just a moment. CUT TO: 100A OMITTED 100A DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 63B-63C. 101 THE FOREST CAMP 101 The new ARRIVALS file in. Men wear citified coats and some women have furs. They eye the veterans, thinking, 'how dirty they are'; the veterans eye them warily, wondering, 'How will we feed them?' A handmade sign reads, \"New Jerusalem.\" Chaya is re-united with her parents. She holds Asael's arm and looks up at him with absolute rapture. She is his. Malbin is collecting valuables. One WELL-DRESSED WOMAN is reluctant to part with her jewelry. WELL-DRESSED WOMAN But they were my grandmother's... GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 64. 101 CONTINUED: (2) 101 MALBIN And now they belong to the otriad. Everyone sacrifices for the sake of the collective. We can trade these for food or weapons. Next... Nearby, Shimon is INTERVIEWING another line of arrivals. SHIMON --How about carpenters? Any bootmakers? Seamstresses? ARRIVAL #1 I am an accountant. SHIMON That should come in handy. Next... RIVA I am a nurse. SHIMON Ahhh...welcome. And you, tateh? OPPENHEIM is an old man with thick glasses. OPPENHEIM I am a watchmaker. Tuvia has walked over to observe. TUVIA Can you repair guns? OPPENHEIM Guns? No. TUVIA See if you can fix this trigger. Oppenheim slips on a pair of spectacles and studies the mechanism. It sticks. He digs into his pocket and produces a small file and expertly begins to shave the metal spur. He tests it, then hands it back to Tuvia, who CLICKS the trigger. TUVIA (CONT'D) You have a new profession. A murmur of appreciation ripples through the group as Shulman appears -- leading A MAGNIFICENT WHITE HORSE. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 65. 101 CONTINUED: (3) 101 SHULMAN Look what we found running free. Must have belonged to an aristocrat. TUVIA My God, she's beautiful. May I? He mounts her easily, urges her around the perimeter, greeting the new arrivals. Heads turn as he trots past. He is the center of attention, and he knows it. And likes it. TUVIA (CONT'D) Friends, we are happy to see you safely among us. But there are many things you must learn about living here... All attention turns to him. The Lubczanski brothers grumble to each other, none too pleased with Tuvia's show-boating. TUVIA (CONT'D) Once you are settled, you'll be assigned work duties. Everyone works, no exceptions. 101A INTERCUT IMAGES 101A Of people being introduced to various tasks: shoemaking, sewing, cooking. Asael teaching them to use guns. TUVIA We will help supply the Russian Partisans by making clothes, repairing guns. 101B BACK TO TUVIA ON HORSEBACK 101B Malbin catches his eye and winks -- clearly this has been part of their \"strategy\" discussions. TUVIA Women will learn to use weapons and fight alongside men. Tuvia takes a rifle from Asael and holds it aloft. TUVIA (CONT'D) This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword. You will all learn to protect yourselves. A LITTLE BOY holds Lilka's hand and looks up at Tuvia in wonder. He cuts an iconic figure. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 65A. 101B CONTINUED: 101B LITTLE BOY He is a Jew? Lilka is equally struck -- although there is something more than wonder in her regard. She nods. TUVU Pregnancies are forbidden. We cannot accommodate an infant's needs. Our bunkers are overcrowded so you will have to build new ones. He looks out over the sea of expectant faces. TUVIA ...This is the one place in all of Belorussia where a Jew can be free. We will make again, here in this forest, the life that was taken from you. We welcome you into our community. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 66. 101C LATER - TUVIA IS WALKING HIS HORSE BESIDE THE RIVER 101C when Riva stops him. RIVA You are Tuvia Bielski? You are really him? (Tuvia nods TENTATIVELY) You are a hero. A Maccabee. She vigorously shakes Tuvia's hand and walks away. Tuvia catches his reflection in the water. And likes it. 102 THE CAMP AT DAWN - TO ESTABLISH 102 102A IN AN UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAWN 102A Lilka awakens to find TEN WOMEN wedged in beside her -- back to front -- like spoons. Idly, she begins to ITCH her scalp. Then her leg. In the pale morning light she sees that she is crawling with lice. She SCREAMS. The women around her wake up, terrified. LILKA Get them off! Get them off me! CHAYA What? Where? LILKA EVERYWHERE! OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD... RIVA Lice need somewhere to sleep, too. The others LAUGH, but Lilka is on the verge of hysteria. She stumbles out, stepping on several others as she goes. 102B OUTSIDE THE BUNKER 102B Crying, she tears at her clothes -- only to discover Tuvia and OTHERS staring at her with interest. She is mortified. 102C LATER THAT DAY 102C THE WOMEN wash clothes in the stream. Lilka is by the riverbank, scrubbing furiously. Tamara works beside her. TAMARA You get rid of them quicker if you boil them. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 66A. 102C CONTINUED: 102C Lilka is grateful for this bit of camp wisdom. BELLA Tamara, come on in, it's freezing and slimy and horrible. Tamara shakes her head, no. RIVA So modest... BELLA ... So last night I dreamed I was taking a real bath. With hot water. RACHEL And soap. YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 66B. 102C CONTINUED: (2) 102C RIVA And bubbles. CHAYA Oh, take me to that dream! RIVA I was dreaming of shoes... CHAYA Shoes, Riva? RIVA There was a man in a shop on Grudek street... and the way he caressed my feet when I tried on his shoes... Riva swoons. The women burst into ribald laughter. The SOUND of a horse. They look to the opposite bank where: TUVIA RIDES BY on his horse. Lilka can't help but stare. BELLA Doesn't take a fortune teller to know what Lilka's dreaming about... Lilka blushes furiously. The women laugh even louder. CUT TO: 103 A FLAT STRETCH OF TRAIN TRACK 103 Gramov shows Zus how to plant a disk-like CONTACT MINE. GRAMOV --buried underneath with this DETONATOR-- (indicates a finger- like protrusion) --almost touching the rail. As the train passes, its weight causes pressure on the detonator, and then-- BOOM! Zus falls over, startled. Gramov laughs. Partisan humor. DOUBLE YELLOW Revision - 10-8-07 67. 104 FOREST CAMP #2 104 Chaya is on kitchen detail with Tamara. TAMARA Yesterday, potatoes with beets, Today, beets with potatoes. Special treat tomorrow...potato soup. With beets. Not far away, Arkady and several others have created a primitive still -- turning potatoes into vodka. ARKADY We love potatoes, don't we, boys! Here, put some hair on your chest! They give Aron his first taste. NEARBY Bella is walking, arm in arm, with Asael. BELLA So...a little bird told me that a certain someone is waiting...for another certain someone to ask a certain question... Go on... She indicates Chaya by wiggling her eyebrows in her direction. Asael shakes his head but heads in that direction. 104A NEARBY 104A Asael \"happens\" to bump into Chaya. ASAEL Hello, Chaya. CHAYA Hello, Asael. ASAEL May...I help you? CHAYA Wash clothes? I... don't think so. An awkward moment as he stands there watching her. ASAEL Chaya... I...was...wondering...if... maybe...you...I mean... you and I-- DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 67A. 104A CONTINUED: 104A CHAYA I accept. ASAEL You do? CHAYA I do. 104B ANOTHER DAY 104B Asael and Chaya are getting married. A LIGHT SNOW is falling as they say repeat their vows as Shimon instructs. Their breath condenses in the cold. ASAEL Behold thou art consecrated unto me by this ring according to the Laws of Moses and Israel. But rather than a ring, Asael gives her a shiny new rifle. As the ceremony continues, we: 104C INTERCUT: A TREE LINE OVERLOOKING A MUDDY ROAD 104C Zus, Ben Zion and several BIELSKI FIGHTERS hide alongside TEN RUSSIAN PARTISANS as a GERMAN TROOP TRUCK approaches. Pachenko watches as Zus follows the approaching truck through binoculars, then cocks the heavy machine gun. The truck SLOWS TO A CRAWL as it encounters an overturned PEASANT CART blocking the road. 104D BACK TO THE WEDDING 104D As Asael kisses the bride, Tuvia is staring not at the newlyweds but rather at Lilka, who has washed and let down her hair. She glances up and meets his eye, then looks away. As Asael crushes the traditional glass underfoot: 104E ZUS OPENS FIRE. 104E The driver SLUMPS over the wheel and the truck careens lazily off the road. GERMAN SOLDIERS spill out, blindly returning fire as Zus's fighters SWARM down the hill. Several are HIT right away. 104F INTERCUT: THE GROWING ECSTASY OF THE WEDDING CELEBRATION 104F WITH THE FRENZY OF BATTLE. People dance and sing, their joy juxtaposed with the murderous intensity of the firefight, their twirling movements a cracked mirror of the death agonies of fighters of both sides as they are hit and fall. DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 67B. 104F CONTINUED: 104F Some of the inexperienced Jewish fighters freeze, some fire their weapons blindly. Ben Zion does well. ZUS RUNS AMONG THEM, fiercely EXHORTING them to attack. ZUS Get up! Move! SHOOT OR I'LL SHOOT YOU... FROM A VANTAGE POINT IN THE ROCKS Viktor watches, heartened by Zus' natural aggression. GERMAN SOLDIERS TAKE COVER behind the overturned truck effectively RETURNING FIRE. Several partisans are KILLED. ZUS PULLS A POTATO MASHER GRENADE from his belt and RUNS AT THE TRUCK in a mad headlong assault. ZUS (CONT'D) ARRRRGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH! He ROLLS THE GRENADE under the truck and dives away as it EXPLODES. The remaining Germans RAISE THEIR HANDS. CHEERING PARTISANS leap into the truck, capturing an arsenal of rifles and ammo. THE JEWISH FIGHTERS join in the looting. Boots, coats, blankets, etc. Zus approaches the wounded and captured German prisoners, kneeling in surrender, hands behind their necks. Without hesitation, he shoots them, point-blank, one after another. VIKTOR approaches Zus, who salutes. VIKTOR You are related to Bielski? ZUS I am a Bielski, too. Viktor looks at him appraisingly. VIKTOR Indeed. He walks away. Zus has found a home. 104G LATER - THE OTRIAD SINGS AND DANCES ON 104G as SNOW continues to fall. The young marriage is a celebration of hope over despair.

A driving wind. Bundled in scarves, overcoats and as many layers as they can wear, Bella and Chaya break ice in a pot. Tamara takes FROZEN LAUNDRY from a line. In a bunker, Malbin and Shimon shiver under a shared blanket. Women and children stare blankly into space. Riva unwraps rags from a man's foot and examines his toes, BLACK with frostbite. Asael and Tuvia are making their rounds. They pass Aron and Rachel who have built a snowman which they top off by adding a German helmet with a bullet hole in it. 109A IN A STORAGE AREA 109A Asael shows Tuvia the last few potatoes. ASAEL There is talk of returning to the ghetto. TUVIA Madness. ASAEL They've barely eaten in days. Even when our food missions manage to get through, there are armed patrols. Farmers who once helped us now guard their barns with shotguns. Tuvia considers for a moment. TUVIA Send out more missions. And bring shotguns. Tuvia sets off. In every face he passes, there's misery and accusation in the shivering bodies and trembling blue lips. Children stare at him with sunken, haunted eyes. 109AA A MAKESHIFT STABLE 109AA Tuvia visits his beautiful horse. He unties him. 109AB LATER - IN THE FOOD LINE 109AB A whisper runs through the group...\"meat\"...\"what kind?\"...\" Where'd it come from?\" Tuvia watches them eat hungrily. 109B OMITTED 109B DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 71. 109C OMITTED 109C AND AND 109D 109D 109E A STABLE - NIGHT 109E Snow falling outside. Several partisans are singing. Zus is drinking heavily with Viktor; they take pinches of salt with each swallow. Viktor finishes a bottle, tosses it. VIKTOR Another dead soldier! Zus looks at him, bleary-eyed, confused. Viktor explains: VIKTOR (CONT'D) More dead soldiers than empty bottles. ZUS That is so...Russian. He cracks open another bottle and takes a big slug. VIKTOR At least you drink like one. ZUS 'A Jew can't drink, a Jew can't fight.' What is it we are good at, Viktor? Dying. That is what we are good at. VIKTOR So tell me about this brother of yours... ZUS .Asael? VIKTOR You are such an idiot. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 71A. 109E CONTINUED: 109E ZUS I know who you mean... The Great Tuvia Bielski. Savior of the Jews and all around Big Shit. VIKTOR You compete with him. ZUS He competes with me. VIKTOR My older brother and I have the same relationship. ZUS He is a Big Shit also? VIKTOR A soldier. He was killed in the first hour of the German invasion. This sobers them up a bit. 109F IN THE ZEMYLANKA 109F LILKA is shivering, her eyes inward and unfocused. TUVIA Lilka? LILKA Sorry, Tuvia. I was...thinking. It's nothing. He looks at her intently, knowing there's more. LILKA (CONT'D) ...Every time new people come into camp, I keep hoping... even though, I know... (her teeth are CHATTERING) ...I'm sorry. TUVIA Everyone here has lost someone. She looks up at him, helpless to be so revealed. LILKA You too? TUVIA Here... He takes off his wool coat and puts it around her shoulders. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 71B. 109F CONTINUED: 109F LILKA No. Today I go on my first food mission. Tuvia's order has consigned her to this dangerous duty. TUVIA I will have Asael send someone else. LILKA No. I must go now. I want to go. She is clearly scared but desperate not to show it. He reaches into his belt and hands her a revolver. TUVIA You know how to use this? She nods. Leaving, she passes the Lubczanski brothers, who are on their way in. DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 72. 110 ON MOTL AND ARKADY 110 MOTL LUBCZANSKI She is a tasty one, your aristocrat. TUVIA She is not my aristocrat. ARKADY LUBCZANSKI No? We were told, 'hands off,' property of the Commander. Tuvia just stares, daring him to continue. 111 LATER THAT DAY 111 Tuvia walks past the now-empty stable heading into the woods. A voice calls out of the misty snow. VOICE HALT! WHO GOES THERE--! TUVIA Lazar. I am coming from camp. The danger is from those coming to camp. LAZAR Sorry, Tuvia... DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 73. 111 CONTINUED: 111 TUVIA No sign of the food mission? LAZAR Not yet. Tuvia looks anxiously into the deep woods. 111A MEANWHILE - DEEP IN THE WOODS 111A Lilka and Shulman are walking backwards, retracing their steps to obscure their footprints in the drifting snow. SHULMAN We mustn't have any tracks leading back to base. He loads two sacks of food onto her shoulders. SHULMAN (CONT'D) Stay on this side of the creek until you reach the river then up the hill. I'll wait here for the others. She nods and trudges on toward camp through waist-deep snow. 112 BACK IN CAMP - OUTSIDE A MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY 112 As they head toward a zemylanka, Riva is briefing Tuvia on the sick. Every now and then, he glances toward the woods. RIVA --several cases of pneumonia... Also I'm beginning to see signs of scurvy. No one's had a vegetable in weeks. LAZAR Tuvia! Lazar is dragging a WOUNDED MAN back into camp. RIVA Bring him to the infirmary. Tuvia glances back toward the woods. Looks at his watch. RIVA (CONT'D) ...Shulman will look after her. He looks up. She looks at him sympathetically. Apparently his interest in Lilka isn' quite as secret as he imagines. 112A BACK TO THE WOODS 112A Exhausted, cold and alone, Lilka is becoming increasingly disoriented in a snowy landscape where every tree looks DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 73A. 112A CONTINUED: 112A alike. She turns in a circle, trying to decide which way to go. A MANGY DOG appears out of nowhere, its coat matted, its ribs showing, a wild look in its eye. It GROWLS ferociously. LILKA Shoo-- Shoo-- DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 74. 112A CONTINUED: (2) 112A But the dog, as ravenous as she, smells the food and won't back down. It inches forward, FOAMING at the mouth. Lilka tries to step back but the dog LUNGES, snapping its jaws. It's terrifying. She looks desperately for help. Suddenly the dog LEAPS at her. She turns away and it rips a sack from her shoulder, knocking her down. Viciously it begins tearing the sack apart in search of the food within. A SHOT RINGS OUT. The dog drops. Lilka holds the smoking gun in two hands. Grimly, she pockets the weapon, picks up the sack of food, and starts off. Reconsidering, she walks back and hoists the dead dog onto her shoulder, too. More food. 112B IN THE INFIRMARY 112B Riva bandages Edjelman's head. Tuvia looks at all the sick. TUVIA What's wrong with them all? RIVA If it's typhus we're in trouble. The lice are carriers. ASAEL The partisans have ampicillin. But they say they need it for themselves. In the background Lilka enters, face scratched, blood smeared hands and arms -- like some kind of primitive huntress. ASAEL (CONT'D) Tuvia... TUVIA Medicine for typhus. I heard you. I'll go see Viktor right away. On his way out, he passes Lilka, who is being looked after. TUVIA (CONT'D) Are you all right? LILKA Fine. Thank you. Tuvia can clearly see that she is shaken -- but he has no time to ask more. He has to find out about the medicine. TUVIA I must go.

VIKTOR --and every time we try to move, they radio back to police HQ which houses the transmitter...here. ZUS --So we attack the transmitter. VIKTOR Yes, yes, my Hebrew warrior. Except for the troops in Stankiewcze and the machine guns out front. THE TENT FLAP OPENS. Tuvia enters. He has developed a cough. VIKTOR (CONT'D) Two Bielski's in one room! To what do we owe this honor? TUVIA We have sickness. I need ampicillin. VIKTOR This medicine is reserved for fighters. TUVIA If typhus breaks out in our camp, it may spread to yours. VIKTOR I will have to take that chance. Zus looks from one immovable force to the other. TUVIA I must insist. Comrade. VIKTOR You'd better not. Zus is watching this dick-measuring with keen interest. ZUS There would be medicine in the police headquarters at Stankiewcze, yes? BLUE Revision - 6-26-07 76. 114 CONTINUED: 114 He looks to Gramov, who looks to Viktor, who nods. ZUS (CONT'D) Tuvia and I grew up there. Perhaps the Bielski otriad will volunteer to take out the transmitter. Viktor looks from Zus to Tuvia. TUVIA Of course. Zus grabs his submachine gun. ZUS Krensky, Ben Zion. Let's go. CUT TO: 115 THE TOWN OF STAKIEWICZE 115 is quiet at midnight on this snowy evening. 116 IN A BACK ALLEY 116 Tuvia and Zus sit in the cab of an old truck, its exhaust sending plumes of condensation into the freezing night. ZUS Well... He looks into the back where the others wait, anxiously clutching their weapons. Tuvia tries to hold back a cough. ZUS (CONT'D) Stay with the truck. And make sure it's in gear when we get back. TUVIA I'm going in with you. ZUS I give the orders tonight. Across the square, the police station looms. TUVIA You don't have to do this. ZUS I don't? What about the typhus? PINK Revision - 7-18-07 77. 116 CONTINUED: 116 TUVIA So more die. They will anyway. A grim smile from Zus. Tuvia is broken up inside. ZUS I have been given this mission by my superior officer. He starts to get out the cab. Tuvia reaches into his pocket, takes out the mezuzah that once blessed their parents' home. TUVIA Zus... For luck. Zuz pockets it and joins the others creeping into the shadows. But rather than follow them into the police station, we HOLD on Tuvia's face. Suddenly we HEAR The sound of gunfire. Then nothing. Ten seconds. More gunfire. Twenty. It is excruciating. Thirty. The longest CLOSE-UP in film history. 117 INTERCUT - FLASHES OF WHAT IS HAPPENING INSIDE... 117 Ben Zion bursts in and opens fire, killing two policemen. Krensky jumps the counter and smashes the transmitter. A policeman appears behind them on the stairs and shoots Krensky in the back. Ben Zion whirls and kills him. 117A TUVIA WANTS TO HELP. HE PULLS HIS GUN, UNLOCKS THE DOOR. 117A OPENS IT. STOPS. HE HAS PROMISED TO WAIT WITH THE TRUCK. Zus, meanwhile, rummages cabinets, looking for ampicillin. BEN ZION Let's GO! In the back room, Zus keeps rummaging. A window EXPLODES. Ben Zion is hit. Mortally wounded, he sinks to his knees, returning fire as Zus reappears. 118 TUVIA WATCHES 118 as Zus bursts out the door. He races to the truck and struggles into the passenger seat, BLEEDING FROM HIS SHOULDER. ZUS Go. GO! TUVIA What about the others?! PINK Revision - 7-18-07 77A. 118 CONTINUED: 118 ZUS GO, DAMN YOU! 119 IN THE TRUCK (TRAVELING) 119 From his coat Zus takes out a BLOOD-SOAKED PACKAGE.

Tuvia absorbs the accusation as if taking a punch. TUVIA So you're a communist now, Zus? Zus lays his head back on the seat, closes his eyes. ZUS Communist, Zionist, Manicurist, what difference does it make? You got your medicine. TUVIA Come back to us. Zus won't look at him. TUVIA (CONT'D) You are my brother. ZUS So you remember. CUT TO: 120 A MOURNER'S CIRCLE IN THE TREES 120 for Ben Zion and Krensky. Shimon addresses the group. SHIMON Merciful God, we commit our friends Ben Zion and Krensky to your care. We have no more prayers, no more tears. We have run out of blood. Choose another people We PAN PAST the familiar faces. SHIMON (CONT'D) We have paid for each of your Commandments. We have covered every field and stone with ashes. Sanctify another land. Choose another people. Teach them the Deeds and the Prophecies. Grant us but one more blessing -- Take back the gift of our holiness. YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 79. 121 IN A ZEMYLANKA - LATER THAT DAY 121 Tuvia is still drinking heavily. He is COUGHING STEADILY, his face sweaty with fever. The SOUND of angry voices from outside the bunker. 122 OUTSIDE - IN THE FOOD LINE 122 Arkady Lubczanski has pulled a knife on Asael, who backs away, STUMBLING into a group of bystanders. ARKADY Next time, I cut off your nose, pisher. Tuvia emerges from his bunker. He is weaving a bit and his words are slurred. TUVIA Whassa problem, Arkady? ARKADY Those who risk their lives to bring back food deserve a larger portion than those who risk nothing. ASAEL Everyone gets the same portion. ARKADY Not when you're serving, pisher. I see you digging to the bottom of the pot for your little forest cutie and her parents... ASAEL She is my wife! TUVIA Policy is...Same for all. If someone is stealing he'll face consequences. Asael is astonished that Tuvia would go against him in public and embarrassed by his public drunkenness. ASAEL What consequences? Others are closely watching this test of Tuvia's authority. TUVIA Reduced rations for one week. Both of you. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 80. 122 CONTINUED: 122 ARKADY WHAT?! TUVIA ARE YOU QUESTIONING MY DECISION? Arkady is tempted to take him on. But he backs down. TUVIA (CONT'D) This matter is settled. Everybody back in line. People are staring at him. TUVIA (CONT'D) WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? BACK IN LINE! His eyes meet Lilka's. She looks away. Asael takes Tuvia's arm and pulls him aside. ASAEL Tuvia, I would never-- TUVIA Yes. I know. ASAEL Then why am I to be punished...? Tuvia just takes another swallow from his bottle. ASAEL (CONT'D) Fischer is with them. So is Levine. On food missions, they take first for themselves and only bring back what's left over-- Tuvia's head is throbbing. He closes his eyes. ASAEL (CONT'D) --and they spread rumors, that you are power-hungry and corrupt, that you take whatever woman you choose-- (Tuvia can't help but laugh) --that we keep gold for ourselves, and that-- He stops himself. TUVIA --What? SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 81. 122 CONTINUED: (2) 122 ASAEL ...that you drink too much and are no longer fit to lead us. TUVIA .Maybe they're right. Asael looks at him. No longer the brother he once idealized. ASAEL Zus would have punched him senseless. TUVIA Zus. ASAEL I miss him. AY TUVIA He has made his choice. He reels away toward the woods. CUT TO: 122A IN HIS ZEMYLANKA - LATER 122A Tuvia is lying in his bunker, vomiting and burning up with fever. Shimon has brought him soup. SHIMON Drink this. From the bottom of the pot. Tuvia can barely get the soup down. TUVIA ...the way they look at me... with their pasty faces. Let them starve, we're all going to die out here anyway. SHIMON Not easy being the big boss. Moses was a lonely man when he led us out of bondage. TUVIA ...Moses. SHIMON So I'm a sucker for a biblical allusion. But what is society without leaders. Without leaders, we falter. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 81A. 122A CONTINUED: 122A TUVIA I am not a leader. SHIMON Neither was Moses, but somehow that seemed to work out. CUT TO: 123 THE PARTISAN CAMP 123 Several partisans are singing a drinking song while Zus silently soaks his feet in a bucket. Lova walks in. His face is black and blue. ZUS Lova, what happened? Who did this? Lova sits and buries his head in his hands. ZUS (CONT'D) Lova. Tell me. Who? LOVA Gramov. Two others. I used the officer's latrine. ZUS For this they beat you? Lova is trying not to weep. LOVA They said they wouldn't shit in the same hole as a Jew. Zus gets to his feet. CUT TO: 123A INT. PANCHENKO'S TENT -- MOMENTS LATER 123A Zus bursts in to find Panchenko deep in conversation with Gramov and others. They look up at the intrusion. ZUS Forgive me, Commander. PANCHENKO Zus. Join us. He offers him a glass of vodka. Zus doesn't take it. ZUS I want to report the mistreatment of a comrade. Gramov looks up. Zus meets his eye. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 81B. 123A CONTINUED: 123A ZUS (CONT'D) This man beat Comrade Lova -- for no reason at all. GRAMOV I had a perfectly good reason. He is a Jew. The other men LAUGH. Panchenko frowns at Gramov. PANCHENKO --and you are an ignorant Tartar. Ignore him. Here... ZUS Anti-semitism is a violation of Party discipline. Panchenko sighs. Does he really have to deal with this? PANCHENKO He's right, Gramov. Apologize to the Jew. GRAMOV I apologize, Jew. PANCHENKO There. You see? Now drink up. Zus doesn't know what to do. He accepts the vodka. 124 EXT. THE BIELSKI CAMP (TO ESTABLISH) 124 Guards ring the snowy perimeter. 125 OMITTED 125 126 THE BLURRED IMAGE OF AN ANGEL FRAMED BY A HALO OF SUNLIGHT 126 as it swims into focus. Tuvia opens his eyes. It is Lilka. She sits beside him, mopping his forehead with a cool rag. LILKA Your fever broke in the night. The medicine helped. TUVIA How long was I asleep? LILKA Two days. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 81C-83. 126 CONTINUED: 126 TUVIA And you've nursed me the whole time? LILKA Chaya helped. TUVIA Did you study nursing at university? LILKA We devoted ourselves to more essential knowledge -- like Greek Philosophy and Latin. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 84. 126 CONTINUED: (4) 126 TUVIA I never went to university. LILKA What kind of work did you do? Before. TUVIA My wife's father had a store. Before the Race Laws. She is is dead. LILKA I'm sorry. TUVIA Tell me more about university. LILKA It all feels like a dream. I spent months trying to master Chopin's nocturnes. TUVIA I'd love to hear you play. LILKA You know Chopin? TUVIA Who doesn't? Chopin the butcher from Novogrudok. LILKA If you're well enough to tease me, you're well enough to eat. I'll see what's for supper. She gets up to go. TUVIA Thank you, Lilka. 127 OUTSIDE TUVIA'S BUNKER 127 THE LUBCZANSKI'S have taken the fullest advantage of Tuvia's illness. There are now TWO LINES of people waiting for food. The malbushim line up like prison inmates. Lazar looks into his bowl -- two beans floating in a scummy broth. IN THE SHORTER LINE Motl, Arkady, Fischer, Levine and a few others are enjoying real food. Lazar calls out from the other line. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 85. 127 CONTINUED: 127 LAZAR Hey, Arkady This isn't soup, it's piss. ARKADY I will piss on your head and you will say it's raining. Eat it. The rest of Lubczanski's cabal laughs. TUVIA emerges from his bunker. The first thing he sees is Asael, whose face is BATTERED AND SWOLLEN. TUVIA What happened? Asael just looks over at the food line -- where Arkady has grabbed Chaya by the waist -- to the delight of the others. Tuvia strides over to them. TUVIA (CONT'D) What is this? ARKADY New policy. Fighters get better food. TUVIA Against my orders... ARKADY You are no longer Commander. Sorry. Tuvia nods, considering his remark for a moment. AND THEN TAKES OUT HIS PISTOL AND SHOOTS ARKADY IN THE CHEST! He then turns the gun on Motl and the others -- they literally cower in fear. He raises his voice to those watching. TUVIA As long as I am the leader of this group, you will obey my commands. THERE WILL BE NO MORE COMPLAINING! NO MORE SITTING! NO MORE DOING NOTHING. ANYONE WANTS TO LEAVE, THEY LEAVE. NOW! The rest work. Every morning we get up and we work. WE WORK. In the snow and the cold and the dark. Tomorrow we begin to build ten new zemylanka, we double the number of food missions. ...We work. Take his body into the woods and leave it for the wolves. He turns and walks away. As he passes the food lines, people subtly move out of his way and whisper after he is gone. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 85A. 127 CONTINUED: (2) 127 Whereas once he was greeted warmly by all, now his isolation is complete. He is the Commander. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 86. 127A TUVIA CAREENS THROUGH THE TREES 127A Tripping over roots, and finally leaning against a tree, he is mumbling, almost incoherent -- part prayer, part profanity. DISSOLVE TO: 128 OMITTED 128 129 THE FIRST BUD OF SPRING 129 struggles through patches of snow. Ice drips from branches. 130 OMITTED 130 130A THE OTRIAD 130A Takes a group portrait. The forest is green again. 131 THE SUNSHINE IS WARM 131 on the women's bodies as they bathe in the river. CHAYA Who has the soap? I know there was a little left? BELLA Use the sand. It's good for your skin. RIVA And what skin! And already married, too! Bella laughs. Chaya splashes her playfully with water. BELLA I've turned into a skeleton. CHAYA And you were always so worried about staying slim. BELLA When we get out of this forest I am going to eat only cake and grow as big as a house. Tamara appears. She's wearing a long overcoat. LILKA Join us. At least the sun is warm. (Tamara turns away; Lilka joins her) Tamara? TAMARA I can't, Lilka... I'm pregnant. DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 86A. 131 CONTINUED: 131 LILKA I had no idea. TAMARA I've kept it hidden for months but now it's obvious. No one can know. They move away from the others. Tamara shows her. TAMARA (CONT'D) It could come any day. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 87. 131 CONTINUED: (2) 131 LILKA ..Who is the father? TAMARA I--- It was when I was escaping. A man with a gun stopped me. I thought he was a Partisan. He told me to follow him and he took me to this place... The memory overwhelms her. She begins to break down. TAMARA (CONT'D) Inside me something broke....I wanted to die. Every night I have nightmares -- what will happen when Tuvia finds out. LILKA He will understand. TAMARA No. You mustn't tell him! LILKA I won't. Don't worry. What are you going to do? Tamara's eyes fill with a new resolve. TAMARA I feel this new life inside me. It's the only thing keeping me going. I won't give it up, I'll kill myself. Lilka puts her arm around her. 131A IN THE DEEP FOREST -- ARON IS OUT HUNTING 131A From his belt hang the pelts of two dead rabbits. He hears A SOUND. Three GERMAN SOLDIERS are putting camouflage on their helmets. Beyond, A GERMAN ARMORED COLUMN. The assault is coming. CUT TO: 132 THE CAMP 132 where Shimon and Malbin are playing chess. Shimon has developed a bad cough. MALBIN You call that a move? SHIMON I call it an inevitable conclusion based on unimpeachable reasoning. DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 A87. 132 CONTINUED: 132 SHIMON (CONT'D) The question, my friend the Genius, is what are you going to do about it. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 87A. 132 CONTINUED: (2) 132 MALBIN I'm thinking about what I'm going to do about it. SHIMON Aha! I got him! MALBIN You didn't get me. You think you got me? How about this? SHIMON Who would make a move like that? MALBIN A genius maybe. Tuvia has been listening nearby. Aron races into the camp. ARON Tuvia... We SEE Aron whispering in Tuvia's ear. DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 88. 132 CONTINUED: (3) 132 TUVIA Asael! Asael comes running. TUVIA (CONT'D) Get a message to Zus. He's got to tell Viktor they're coming. CUT TO: 133 OMITTED 133 133A EXT. CAMP PERIMETER - DAYS LATER 133A Tuvia stands peering out into the forest. Asael joins him. ASAEL Lazar spotted another patrol. They're getting closer. Tuvia nods. Suddenly, he HEARS a strange sound. An animal? TUVIA Do you hear that? 134 IN THE WOMEN'S ZEMYLANKA 134 We HEAR the SOUND for what it is... The cry of a newborn. A baby boy in this mud manger. Riva and Lilka have assisted. Tamara holds her new baby to her breast. Suddenly -- the blanket serving as a door is SWEPT ASIDE. TUVIA stands there. Tamara cries out and shields the baby. Lilka springs up and pushes him back outside. 135 OUTSIDE THE BUNKER 135 Tuvia walks angrily. Lilka keeps up. LILKA She promises not to take extra food... TUVIA This is against my orders. LILKA So you are going to shoot her, too? Tuvia stares at her. He has never seen this side of her. LILKA (CONT'D) Please, Tuvia. The baby is all she has to live for. TUVIA I cannot allow it. He turns away. DOUBLE SALMON Revision - 10-21-07 88A. 135 CONTINUED: 135 Lilka SPINS him around, surprising him with her strength and the strength of her passion. PINK Revision - 7-18-07 89. 135 CONTINUED: (2) 135 LILKA You must let it live! TUVIA I cannot keep the living alive. Tamara and the man who fathered this child are responsible for its fate. LILKA She was raped by the Nazis. Tuvia closes his eyes. He is tired of being in charge, tired of being the arbiter of other peoples' fate. LILKA (CONT'D) ...You tell us to hold onto our humanity. Not to become like animals. What better way than by bringing a life into this world of suffering and death. It's our only hope. Tuvia is undone by her intensity. The very nearness of her. The smell of her newly-washed hair. The glow of her skin. He looks at her. And nods in surrender. LILKA (CONT'D) Thank you, Tuvia. She kisses him. A chaste kiss of gratitude. She pulls back and they look into each other's eyes. The next kiss is something entirely different. TUVIA Lilka... LILKA I knew what was expected of the women here -- yet you never touched me... TUVIA Shhh.. LILKA I'm not afraid of anything, Tuvia. I'm not even afraid of you. They kiss deeply. 136 IN TUVIA'S BUNKER - LATER 136 Lilka lies in his arms. DOUBLE GOLDENROD Revision - 10-21-07 90. 136 CONTINUED: 136 TUVIA The Germans are coming into the forest. I don't know what is going to become of us. LILKA It doesn't matter. If I had stayed in the ghetto I'd be dead. You saved my life. TUVIA No. You have saved mine. He reaches for her but before they can begin to make love again-- THE BLANKET DOOR IS PUSHED ASIDE. Malbin is there. MALBIN Oh... ..I..... Hello, Lilka. LILKA Hello, Asael. TUVIA Yes? MALBIN We've caught one. CUT TO: 137 A GERMAN SS SCOUT, HANDS TIED BEHIND HIS BACK 137 is led into the clearing. He wears the same uniform as those who marched the villagers into the forest for execution. ASAEL He's a scout. TUVIA They're coming for us. Group members have begun to gather around him. They begin to hurl insults -- schtik drek, paskudnyak -- as the hapless man is pushed to his knees. ASAEL We found this in his pouch. He hands Tuvia a sheaf of documents -- including a map. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 91. 137 CONTINUED: 137 TUVIA Entrance points, wetlands, obstacles. You read this. SHIMON They've assigned an entire division to surround the forest. A tidal wave is coming. ASAEL Don't they have a war to fight? SHIMON Assault begins in two days. Passover. How fitting. Meanwhile, some of the group have begun TORMENTING the man. MOTL Monster! He kicks him in the head. SHULMAN Bulvan! Shulman PUNCHES him in the face. GERMAN COURIER Bitte....Bitte... TUVIA Did you reach Viktor? ASAEL He's on his way. The tormenting of the poor courier is gaining intensity. MALBIN TUVIA-- The German lets loose a torrent of pleading. GERMAN COURIER Ich habe frau und kinder! SHIMON He says he has a wife and children. Lazar picks up a stick. The German tries to crawl away; the crowd blocks his escape, pushing him back into the center. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 91A. 137 CONTINUED: (2) 137 LAZAR So did I! RIVA If you let him go, he will lead them back here. Tuvia looks at Malbin. What to do? CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 92. 137 CONTINUED: (3) 137 MALBIN Ask if he'll promise not to reveal our location. Shimon translates. SHIMON Sie mussen versprechen nicht zu sagan wo wir sind. The man looks up at him, pleadingly. GERMAN COURIER Nein....Nein... SHULMAN He'll say anything. He breaks the stick across the man's back. LAZAR We want justice... MOTL Justice... Soon it is a chant: \"Justice! .Justice!\" Tuvia looks at their faces. Only months ago they were decorous, civilized. Now they are hungry, almost feral. Murderous. Bella has been silently watching. She steps into the circle, looks down at the terrified German man. BELLA My son's name was David. David Kagan. We SEE now that she is holding a sharpened hoe. BELLA (CONT'D) He was fifteen. He had blue eyes. She raises it above her head. BELLA (CONT'D) He played the piano. She swings with all her might. The others watch with a mix of thrilled horror and perverse delight. A line has been crossed. Riva steps forward, holding a large shovel. RIVA My sister's name was Ellie... As she swings the shovel, the CAMERA begins to back away. Miriam steps forward, carrying a large rock. MIRIAM My husband was Meyer... The group closes in, obscuring our view of the body. Aron can't take any more. He runs off into the woods. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 A92. 137 CONTINUED: (4) 137 MOTL My parents, Sol and Raya. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 92A. 137 CONTINUED: (5) 137 AVRAM For my daughter, Sonya. MORDECAI For my mother. RACHEL My sister. LILKA My whole family. ALL JUSTICE! JUSTICE! . Tuvia closes his eyes. He has done nothing to stop it. Asael looks at Malbin and Shimon. They are undone by what they have witnessed. Tuvia walks away. Behind them, the group separates -- staring at the lifeless body on the ground. And then they look at each other, their blood lust sated, beginning to reckon with what they have done. What they have become. 138 TUVIA STANDS ALONE IN THE FOREST, HIS FACE IN SHADOW 138 He sees Aron, squatting beside a tree, crying silently. Tuvia kneels beside him, cradling him. TUVIA Reeboynoy shel oylum... Lord of the Universe. We have done unspeakable things yet still I seek your mercy... He HEARS something. Malbin waits at the edge of the forest. His face is drawn and pale from what has just happened. DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 93. 138 CONTINUED: 138 MALBIN Viktor is here. CUT TO: 139 VIKTOR AND ZUS 139 are waiting in the clearing. Tuvia approaches. He and Zus nod to each other but do not speak. It is excruciating. Tuvia and Viktor walk into the woods. Zus waits with other BODYGUARDS as Asael joins them. Zus wears a Nazi jacket. ZUS He doesn't look good. ASAEL I could say the same about you. Where'd you get the jacket? ZUS Let's just say the former owner no longer had need of it. Zus winks. The other bodyguards stare impassively. ZUS (CONT'D) Embrace me. Asael looks confused for a moment, then embraces him. ZUS (CONT'D) Hide this. (shoves a revolver into his pocket) Wolnicky stores ammunition for us in his barn. There's no guard. He slaps Asael fondly on the cheek and rejoins his comrades. 140 VIKTOR AND TUVIA 140 sit on a downed tree and converse in Russian, with subtitles: VIKTOR You found these on the prisoner? Tuvia nods. Viktor studies the scout's documents. Tisking. TUVIA We can't fight an entire division. VIKTOR The battle on the Eastern Front has begun. The more troops we engage here, the fewer they have to attack the Motherland. DOUBLE GREEN Revision - 10-14-07 93A. 140 CONTINUED: 140 TUVIA We've done our part for the Motherland. BUFF Revision - 9-2-07 94. 140 CONTINUED: (2) 140 VIKTOR My orders are to take command of all partisan operations. You will bring the rest of your fighters to me. TUVIA And the others? Old people, women and children. VIKTOR In war there are casualties. TUVIA And if I refuse? VIKTOR You are officially a deserter. Do you know the policy on dealing with deserters? Viktor unfolds a paper flyer from his pocket. VIKTOR (CONT'D) ...The Germans are offering fifty thousand marks for information leading to your capture. Not a very flattering likeness. Too Jewish. Viktor rejoins his bodyguards, turns back for a last word. VIKTOR (CONT'D) Have your men in my camp by tonight. He walks off. Asael takes the wanted poster from Tuvia. ASAEL I wouldn't show this around. There are some who'd turn you in for less. CUT TO: 141 LATER - A SPOTTER PLANE BUZZES HIGH ABOVE - HUNTING 141 Down below, Viktor and the Russian partisans have struck their tents and hidden beneath the sheltering trees. Viktor's gaze follows the plane. He gives an order into a field radio. Zus has been listening. SALMON Revision - 8-19-07 95. 141 CONTINUED: 141 ZUS You want them to find Tuvia's camp. Viktor just looks at him. ZUS (CONT'D) You're deliberately sacrificing them so we can remain safe? VIKTOR No. So we can keep fighting. Everyone must sacrifice in the struggle. ZUS Those are my brothers. VIKTOR I am your brother! He is your brother! Comrade Zus. Your Jewish sentimentality is heart-warming, but counter-revolutionary. Zus has secretly known he would hear these words. He grips his rifle but holds his tongue. BACK TO: 142 THE SPOTTER PLANE -- FLIES OVER THE BIELSKI CAMP 142 Tuvia stares up at it. Have they been spotted? Shimon is sitting nearby with a group of children. He looks pale. His cough is worse. He is very ill. SHIMON ...but the children of Israel were afraid to leave Egypt. Until Moses said, 'Do not trust in me, trust in God.' He will take care of you' And so tomorrow we celebrate the Passover by sitting around and arguing just as we have done for centuries. Tuvia stares at them, a curious expression on his face. Malbin comes to stand beside him. MALBIN Did it see us? PINK Revision - 7-18-07 96. 142 CONTINUED: 142 TUVIA Tomorrow is Passover. Yes? MALBIN ...How should I know? TUVIA Moses. The Exodus. Malbin doesn't get it at first. TUVIA (CONT'D) --He left before Pharaoh could stop them. Now Malbin understands. He looks at Shimon. MALBIN You want to move them all? The old, the sick. They'll never make it. It isn't the first time Tuvia has consigned people to their death, and apparently it won't be the last. TUVIA We leave now. Spread the word. 143 MOMENTS LATER - THE BIELSKI CAMP 143 is a blur of activity as everyone mobilizes for evacuation. Sacks and cooking equipment is tied onto impromptu packs. Asael and Malbin coax the older people into motion-- ASAEL Come, tateh-- OPPENHEIM But my tools-- The SOUND of approaching aircraft. Tuvia searches the sky. Riva pairs each of the elderly with a child. Tamara tucks her newborn under her coat. The SOUND of the approaching aircraft grows LOUDER. People look up, shielding their eyes. Then from out of the sun, two ominous silhouettes: STUKA DIVE BOMBERS! TUVIA TAKE COVER! 144 THE SCREAMING WHISTLE OF THE FIRST BOMBER 144 panics the crowd. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 97. 144 CONTINUED: 144 Some race into the forest; others are frozen. Tuvia grabs people and bodily drags them to cover. STRAFING 20MM CANNON chew up the ground. Several people are hit before they can reach cover. Lilka herds everyone she can into: 145 A BUNKER 145 where people crowd in like sardines. Chaya and Riva gather children around them. They hear the WHISTLE of an incoming shell....BOOM! Dirt from the roof rains down on them. 146 BOMBS BEGIN TO RAIN DOWN 146 Dirt and debris everywhere. AN INCENDIARY SHELL HITS high in a tree. Its branches burst into flame. An hysterical woman leaps out of a bunker and is BLOWN APART. 147 MEANWHILE - IN VIKTOR'S CAMP 147 Zus listens helplessly to the distant sound of bombs dropping on his brothers. 148 BACK IN THE BIELSKI CAMP - A DIRECT HIT ON A ZEMYLANKA 148 It explodes into a million pieces. Wood shrapnel everywhere. Where once was a bunker, now there is only a gaping crater. Tuvia races into the maelstrom to help the wounded. AN EXPLOSION KNOCKS HIM DOWN He tries to clear his head but he cannot focus. ALL SOUND FADES AWAY to be replaced by a high-pitched hum. 149 TUVIA'S WORLD IS IN SLOW-MOTION 149 Falling dirt and debris, tumbling bodies, exploding bunkers -- a surreal effect. 150 IN REAL TIME -- THE CAMP IS BEING TORN APART 150 Cowering in safety, Malbin sees Tuvia lying in the open and gathers his courage -- RACING through danger to his side. MALBIN Are you alright? Tuvia shakes his head, points to his ears. He cannot hear. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 98. 150 CONTINUED: 150 MALBIN (CONT'D) ARE...YOU...ALRIGHT? When Tuvia speaks, his WORDS sound DULL and MUFFLED. TUVIA MUST...GO! MALBIN ...WHAT? TUVIA THE GERMANS...COMING...! Malbin looks around, panicked. Asael appears out of the smoke, yells at Malbin above the din. ASAEL Get them out of the bunkers! Malbin runs off. Asael helps Tuvia to his feet. A nearby explosion SHOWERS THEM with dirt as they CRAWL to safety. The world RAMPS BACK TO NORMAL SPEED at a dizzying rate. ASAEL (CONT'D) We need to hold them off...until the rest are safe. Tuvia still can't hear. Asael pantomimes firing a rifle. ASAEL (CONT'D) ...HOLD...THEM...OFF! Tuvia nods, trying to clear the buzzing in his head. TUVIA ...MACHINE GUN... ASAEL With Levine and Miriam... There. Lazar, Rosa, and Schmuel. There and there. And me. Tuvia shakes his head, no. ASAEL (CONT'D) Yes. He runs off. Still clearing his head, Tuvia regains his footing -- suddenly realizing the the bombing has stopped. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 98A. 151 AT THE ENTRY WAY TO A ZEMYLANKA 151 Malbin appears, eyes wild. MALBIN Everybody out! Now! But the group's natural reaction is to stay huddled in safety GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 99. 151 CONTINUED: 151 MALBIN (CONT'D) THE COSSACKS ARE COMING! This gets the job done. People begin to crawl out. 152 OTHERS EMERGE FROM THE BUNKERS 152 YOUNG PEOPLE holding hands with OLD, PARENTS with CHILDREN on their backs. Tuvia urges Lilka and Bella to hurry them into the woods. 153 MEANWHILE -- THE ASSIGNED DEFENDERS, MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE 153 take up their assigned positions: Levine mans the heavy machine gun behind a log; Lazar, Miriam and Rosa in the trees. Tuvia anxiously waits for the last of the women and children to disappear into the forest. A SUDDEN SILENCE DESCENDS - EVERYONE LOOKS TO THE SKY Tuvia realizes the bombers have broken off their attack. He knows the ground troops will soon follow. He turns to Asael, grabbing his shoulders. TUVIA Don't try to fight... Just slow them down. Then join us. Asael nods. No need for more words. They embrace fiercely. Asael pushes Chaya toward Tuvia. ASAEL Take her. She resists, clinging to his arm for a moment. TUVIA Come. He forces her to join him and catch up to the others. 154 THE CAMP 154 is eerily quiet as the dust begins to settle. The defenders check their weapons with grim efficiency. They are no longer inept innocents; they have become warriors. 155 DEEPER IN THE WOODS 155 Tuvia catches up with the fleeing group and urges them on. 156 MOMENTS LATER -- THE DEFENDERS WAIT ANXIOUSLY 156 We study their faces. Beautiful in their stoic acceptance. GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 99A. 156 CONTINUED: 156 SUDDENLY -- A FUSILLADE from the woods. Rosa falls dead. The defenders RETURN FIRE. Levine fires the machine gun; Miriam feeds the belt. 157 UP AHEAD WITH THE FLEEING GROUP 157 Tuvia hears small arms fire. He knows what it means. BUFF Revision - 9-2-07 100. 158 BACK AT THE CAMP 158 The rear guard action can't hold out for very long. Tree by tree, they begin to fall back. Asael fires blindly into the murky shadows. The SOUND of a man crying out. Then Levine is hit. Miriam pushes him out of the way and TAKES OVER. She expertly kills several assault troops who appear out of the woods. The rest of the attackers TAKE COVER. 159 WITH THE FLEEING GROUP 159 Malbin waits anxiously for Tuvia, clutching a map. MALBIN (struggling to control his panic) This swamp here...goes...for miles. TUVIA Show me. 160 BACK AT THE CAMP 160 Lazar runs from tree to tree, keeping up a steady stream of fire. He is surprisingly brave. Until A GRENADE flies out of the woods and lands at his feet, killing him instantly. The Assault Troops have begun to outflank them. Asael is suddenly in jeopardy. Sara sees the danger. MIRIAM GO! Miriam keeps their ATTACKERS pinned down as the two men race for new positions. Then she is hit. She keeps firing anyway, her finger locked on the trigger even as she is dying. More troops begin firing from their flank. Asael has no choice but to break off. They race into the woods. 161 BACK TO THE FLEEING GROUP 161 Tuvia hears the guns go silent. This, too, has meaning. 162 A RISE REVEALS THE IMMENSITY OF THE KRASNAYA GORKA SWAMP 162 Malbin stares at what lies ahead. MALBIN Oh, my God... TAN Revision - 9-10-07 100A. 162 CONTINUED: 162 TUVIA Are the others back yet? (Malbin looks stricken; he shakes his head) ..Asael? Malbin shakes his head once more. Asael is not coming back. Chaya begins to weep. Riva comforts her. SHULMAN We've got to keep going! BELLA The Germans will be here any minute! MALBIN Do we wait...a while? MORDECAI We could hide... MAN #3 I say, fight them here. MOTL Yes. Fight! SHULMAN That's crazy! Tuvia is in hell. If he waits for Asael, he risks them all being caught. Suddenly it all falls apart. Tuvia sinks to his knees as if his legs can no longer bear his weight. MALBIN Tuvia--? Tuvia can't speak. He has no more answers. Nothing to say. He stares at the impenetrable swamp. The end of the line. The sudden vacuum of leadership is felt by them all. They stare at one another, anxious and rudderless. WOMAN (ZOE) My father cannot make it. RONA There are snakes-- Tamara's newborn is crying. She tries to comfort it. An old woman stares at the swamp in terror. MAN #1 (FROHMAN) The children... SHULMAN We'll put them on our shoulders. TAN Revision - 9-10-07 100A1. 162 CONTINUED: (2) 162 BELLA Tuvia, what do we do? Oppenheim is petrified. Rona is crying. MALBIN TUVIA-- And still Tuvia is silent. More arguing. A general MURMUR of dread is rising. Malbin goes to kneel beside Shimon, who is covered in sweat -- undone by the forced march. MALBIN (CONT'D) What's wrong with him? SHIMON ...He... ..is... ..tired. Malbin hears something, looks up. FROM HIGH ABOVE - THE SPOTTER PLANE APPEARS They have been found. Lilka kneels beside Tuvia. TAN Revision - 9-10-07 100B. 162 CONTINUED: (3) 162 She takes his hand silently. LILKA COME-- He shakes his head. TUVIA You have a weapon? She shows him her revolver. He checks the clip, then looks into her eyes. TUVIA (CONT'D) Use it on yourself before you let them take you. She nods gravely. Suddenly a VOICE interrupts. VOICE Why are we stopping? Everyone turns. It's Asael. Back from the dead. He hands off a wounded comrade to Riva's care. ASAEL They're coming! Why aren't we moving? Tuvia looks up at him, lost. Almost helpless. ASAEL (CONT'D) We must keep going! TAMARA In there? RONA It is impossible! More murmuring. Asael raises his voice. ASAEL Nothing is impossible! What we have done is impossible! The murmuring quiets. Asael meets Tuvia's eyes. He is literally willing his older brother to be strong for them, as he has been, time and again. ASAEL (CONT'D) God will not part these waters. We will do it ourselves. RONA But how? GOLDENROD Revision - 8-16-07 100B1. 162 CONTINUED: (4) 162 ASAEL Not by miracles. By our strength. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 100C. 162 CONTINUED: (5) 162 ASAEL (CONT'D) (turning to the man beside him) Take the rope from your pack. Now, you....give me your belt. SHULMAN We don't have enough rope. ASAEL We'll link arms. Make a chain. A human chain. MOTL What are you talking about? Tuvia is deeply moved. His little brother has become a man. Once more, he finds his voice. TUVIA Each person takes care of the other. .Give him your belt. Asael nods at Tuvia gratefully. The group is hushed, apprehensive. Then: ONE MAN Removes his belt and offers it to Asael. ANOTHER STANDS, HOLDING HIS BELT And then another. One by one they offer them. There is something quietly heroic in the gesture. Tuvia looks at the group, looks away, fighting back emotion. SALMON Revision - 8-18-07 100D-100E. 162A THEY WADE IN, WAIST HIGH 162A People link arms and hold on for dear life yet still they flounder. A man goes under, is pulled up. A harrowing undertaking. 162AA THE BELTS ARE ROPED ACROSS THE DEEP POOL 162AA People cling to it as they drag themselves, hand over hand. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 101. 162B SOMEONE CLIMBS OUT TO WALK ALONG THE BANK. 162B TUVIA No tracks on land. Get back in. It is almost impossible to make any progress. Especially when one is weak and malnourished. 162C IN A DEEP BOG 162C The mud sticks to their clothes, faces. Soon they are indistinguishable from their surroundings. When one person sinks in the muck, it takes three to get him back on his feet. The column slows. Tuvia gestures for them to keep moving. They can't. Literally cannot. He begins to physically push them on. Sometimes harshly. Eventually they are moving again. CUT TO: 163 A GHOSTLY LANDSCAPE 163 Gnarled bare trees shrouded in mist. They trudge forward, their expressions wan and empty. Tuvia find Malbin and pulls him aside. TUVIA How much farther? Malbin shrugs his shoulders. Who knows...? 163A THE WATER IS ALMOST HEAD HIGH 163A Parents hoist children onto their shoulders, hold weapons overhead as they claw at tall reeds to propel themselves forward, step by tortuous step. SHIMON clings to a tree. His wracking cough is terrifying and he is deathly pale. TUVIA Come... Shimon can't catch his breath, he just shakes his head, no. He can't go on. Tuvia half-drags, half-carries him onward. CUT TO: CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 102. 164 A SPIT OF LAND IN THE SWAMP - DUSK 164 They rest, eat what little food is left. A litter carrying Shimon is deposited on dry ground. He is barely alive. MALBIN Is he...? Tuvia shakes his head. It's only a matter of time. The Spotter Plane drones overhead. TUVIA Take off your glasses. Reflections. Tuvia moves off to check on the others. MALBIN Shimon, listen to me, the physical plane is just an illusion. Only the spiritual plane is real. SHIMON No. The physical plane is where man acts to redeem himself. MALBIN You've redeemed yourself enough, you should shut up now. SHIMON Look who's talking about shutting up... I need to tell you something. MALBIN What is it? SHIMON You shouldn't think so much. The world around you is beautiful. MALBIN This world? SHIMON Even this one. Tuvia has come to sit beside Lilka. She leans into him. TUVIA We're lost. LILKA No. ..No. She puts her arms around him. CHERRY Revision - 9-2-07 102A. 164 CONTINUED: 164 They hold each other and drift off to sleep. CUT TO: 165 AT NIGHTFALL - A SQUAD OF GERMAN SOLDIERS 165 sit around a campfire at the edge of the swamp. FROM NEARBY The LIGHTS of their fire can be seen flickering through the reeds as the ragged column MOVES SILENTLY past. TUVIA Not a sound. Pass the word. We watch as the ORDER is passed down the line. Parents hold hands over their childrens' mouths. Shimon is carried on an improvised litter made of branches. CUT TO: 166 A FOREST CROSSROADS 166 Panchenko and a few others are on horseback. Behind them the rest of the Partisans are marching away. Zus and the Jewish fighters are on foot, awaiting orders. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 103. 166 CONTINUED: 166 PANCHENKO You will hold this crossroads until the brigade has completed its retreat. Zus looks around at the position. ZUS For how long? Panchenko's orders are never to be questioned. PANCHENKO Until you are ordered to withdraw. ZUS And if we cannot hold the position? Panchenko looks at Gramov, who stands nearby cradling a submachine gun. PANCHENKO Comrade Gramov will enforce discipline, if necessary. Gramov smiles. The implications are clear: nobody retreats. PANCHENKO (CONT'D) You have served us well, Comrade. ZUS I am so honored, Comrade. Panchenko wheels his horse and gallops off. Zus and his men take cover in the woods. In the distance we can HEAR the unmistakable SOUND of approaching armor. Lova kneels beside Zus. LOVA What are we doing here? Zus? Half a mile down the road, A TANK rumbles into view. LOVA (CONT'D) Tell me. Who are we doing this for? With a shaking hand, Zus tries to light a Molotov cocktail but his matches are wet. He reaches into his pocket for more. Instead he finds the mezuzah that was once affixed to his family's door. As he stares at it, the SOUND of the approaching tank grows louder. BACK TO: YELLOW Revision - 7-30-07 103A-105. 167 THE KRASNAYA GORKA SWAMP 167 empties at last into a shallow river. On the opposite bank is dry land, and beyond, the deep forest. And safety. The bedraggled group makes their way across. 168 OMITTED 168 GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 106-106A. 169 ON THE OPPOSITE BANK 169 Asael pulls people up onto dry ground. They lie there, freezing and exhausted. Some cannot control their shivering. SHULMAN What's next...Sinai? Tuvia can't help but laugh. Soon they are all laughing. It ripples throughout the group. Joyous. Contagious. An overwhelming feeling of relief. They are safe. Tuvia lies on the ground. All the adrenaline has suddenly left his body. Then Aron appears, tugging at his sleeve. Shimon is asking for him. Tuvia kneels down beside his teacher, whose eyes are closed. Malbin is weeping quietly. Who will he argue with? SHIMON .Tuvia... TUVIA Right here. Shimon is at the end. SHIMON ...Something...to say... TUVIA Shhhh... SHIMON ...no...please... I almost lost...my faith....but you...were sent..by God..to save us. TUVIA Ridiculous. SHIMON I know... ... But just...in case... .I thank....HIM... .and I thank you. He closes his eyes. It's too much for Tuvia. Hard as he tries, he cannot stop the tears from filling his eyes. GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 107. 170 SUDDENLY -- UP THE RIVERBANK 170 Trees begin to FALL OVER -- as if pushed by a dinosaur. A PANZER TANK emerges onto the banks, less than a quarter-of-mile away. ITS TURRET BEGINS TO SWIVEL The menacing gun turning in their direction. 171 THE GROUP IS CAUGHT OUT IN THE OPEN. 171 THE TANK ROARS FIRE. The first round EXPLODES among them. Several are killed. TUVIA Back to the river! He pushes people down. They cling to the banks, cowering. THOSE WITH WEAPONS take cover, using the embankment as if it were the lip of a trench. They RETURN FIRE -- old men, young women, even some children. 172 A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY ADVANCES 172 behind the tank, using it as protection. Aron kills one. But the Germans are well-trained. They direct a withering fire -- forcing the partisans to keep their heads below the embankment. BUT THE TANK IS UNSTOPPABLE It turns its attentions on the riverbank -- its first round SAILS OVERHEAD, sending up a huge geyser of water. But the next round PLOWS INTO THE EARTH, tearing a huge chunk of earth and killing two of the brigade. TUVIA grabs a satchel and begins filling it with grenades. He throws the satchel over Malbin's head, grabs his arm and races, crouching low, beneath the lip of the riverbank. Asael provides covering fire. So do Lilka, Chaya and the women alongside the men. UP AHEAD A stand of trees hides Tuvia from view as he climbs out of the river and heads into the forest. He pulls Malbin down just as A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY approaches and begins to set up a heavy machine gun. GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 107A. 172 CONTINUED: 172 Tuvia POPS UP behind them, spraying them with his submachine gun. He then turns the heavy machine gun on the infantry advancing behind the tank -- to devastating effect. But now, the tank turns its attention to Tuvia. Its machine gun begins to chew up the forest, forcing Tuvia to take cover. Without pausing to think, Malbin grabs a grenade from the satchel and races toward the tank. It falls pitifully short, exploding harmlessly as Malbin is cut down. DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 108. 173 TUVIA IS NOW ISOLATED AND PINNED DOWN 173 Bullets tear chunks out of trees as he tries to take cover. THE TURRET SWIVELS IN HIS DIRECTION It is only a matter of moments before he is dead. WHEN SUDDENLY FROM OUT OF THE WOODS Zus and the rest of Jewish fighters emerge, firing on the run. Without regard for his own life, Zus charges. The German infantry is caught in a cross-fire as the Bielski brigade climbs out the river, firing wildly. Zus guns down the tank commander manning the machine gun from the open hatch. Jumps onto the tank and DROPS A GRENADE inside. An EXPLOSION of BLACK SMOKE BILLOWS. Zus stands up amid the billowing smoke. He sees Tuvia who is staring back at him. 174 BOTH GROUPS MEET - THE DESTROYED TANK SMOLDERS NEARBY 174 Asael is the first to reach Tuvia, who is carrying the German assault machine gun. TUVIA Only weapons and ammunition! Spread the word. Tuvia hands him the machine gun. ASAEL Anything else? Tuvia looks at him. Is he fucking with him? Just a little. TUVIA Go on. Lilka is carrying a small child. TUVIA (CONT'D) Lilka, please help. We've got to get the injured into the forest. LILKA What about the dead? TUVIA Everybody gather your things! We have to get out of the open! Nearby, Aron removes the machine from the tank and hands it to Zus. Bella approaches. Zus embraces her. Tuvia seizes one of the German rifles. He yells to Shulman. TUVIA (CONT'D) Shulman! Weapons only! Tell them. DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 108A. 174 CONTINUED: 174 Shulman follows Tuvia's order. TUVIA (CONT'D) You've been promoted. Congratulations! Tuvia turns, sees Bella with Zus. They see him. Zus hands Bella the machine gun from the tank and approaches. TUVIA (CONT'D) Where is the rest of your unit? ZUS Good question. TUVIA You are going back? ZUS No. They look at each other. So much unsaid. No time to say it. TUVIA We've got to build a new camp. Zus nods. ZUS Perhaps you have room for one more? DOUBLE BLUE Revision - 9-17-07 109. 174 CONTINUED: (2) 174 Tuvia reaches out his arms and they embrace fiercely. 175 IN THE DEEP WOODS - LATER 175 They walk in silence. Lilka comes to walk beside him, resting her head on his shoulder as they walk. Tuvia looks up at the shafts of light slanting through the towering trees, as if allowing himself to appreciate its beauty for the first time. Suddenly, he stops, listening, puzzled. TUVIA Don't you hear it? ZUS What...? TUVIA Nothing. Isn't it beautiful? We HOLD on Tuvia. He has aged ten years in one. PINK Revision - 7-18-07 110. 175 CONTINUED: 175 But for now he allows himself a brief moment of satisfaction. We might even see the ghost of a smile. But it is short- lived as Asael appears by his side and we see concern once again clouding his face. Another problem to attend to. And as THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL AWAY he is already hurrying to catch up with the others. As they all disappear from sight into the sheltering darkness of the woods, these words appear on screen: THEY LIVED IN THE FOREST FOR TWO MORE YEARS. IN THEIR NEW CAMP THEY BUILT A SCHOOL, A HOSPITAL, A NURSERY. AND STILL MORE CAME TO FIND THEM. AT THE TIME OF LIBERATION, TWELVE HUNDRED WALKED OUT OF THE FOREST. DISSOLVE TO: 176 THE OPENING SCENE - NEW YORK CITY - 1982 176 Park Avenue. Traffic. More words on screen: ASAEL JOINED THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND DIED SIX MONTHS LATER. ZUS AND TUVIA EMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES. In the taxi, THE ELDERLY MAN thrusts his hand through the slot in the Plexiglas window separating him from the driver. ELDERLY MAN Here is money. I can get more. So much more. Take it, please. CAB DRIVER No, no... Indeed, when the CABBIE speaks, though the voice is older and somewhat frail, we recognize it as Tuvia's. ELDERLY MAN What else can I give you, do for you? AGED TUVIA Nothing, it isn't necessary. Tears stream down the elderly man's cheeks. ELDERLY MAN We are alive because of you. My children. His children. So many. .Thousands. DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 111. 176 CONTINUED: 176 Behind them, HORNS are HONKING. This is New York City. AGED TUVIA Please, the traffic... ELDERLY MAN Bless you, Tuvia Bielski. May the Lord bless you and keep you all the days of your life. THE CAB PULLS AWAY FROM THE CURB INTO THE RAIN - MIDDLE-AGED SON Papa, who was that man? The Elderly Man watches the cab pull away, wiping his eyes. ELDERLY MAN That wasn't a man. That was an angel. As the cab pulls away, the CAMERA CRANES UP until it is lost in an anonymous sea of traffic. These words appear on SCREEN: TUVIA BIELSKI NEVER SOUGHT RECOGNITION FOR WHAT HE DID. HE DROVE A CAB IN NEW YORK CITY FOR TWENTY YEARS. TUVIA AND LILKA REMAINED MARRIED UNTIL HIS DEATH IN 1987. FADE OUT. www.vantageawards.com"
